    "That night we drank warm whiskey",
    "in our parked car",
    "beyond woods now lost to the suburbs,",
    "I fell in love with you.",
    "What waited was the war",
    "like a bloody curtain,",
    "and a righteous moment",
    "when the lovely boy\u2019s",
    "spine was snapped,",
    "then the long falling into hell.",
    "But lately, you\u2019ve been calling me",
    "back through the years of bitter silence",
    "to tell me of another river of blood",
    "and of the highland\u2019s",
    "howl at dusk of human voices",
    "blasted into ecstasy.",
    "That night in sweet Lorain",
    "we drank so long and hard",
    "we raised ourselves",
    "above the broken places,",
    "mill fires burning",
    "red against the sky. Why",
    "is there no end",
    "to this unraveling."
