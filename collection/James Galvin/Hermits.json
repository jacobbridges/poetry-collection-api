    "And this would be good country if a man could eat scenery.",
    "The lake\u2019s ice gives light back to the air,",
    "Shadows back to water.",
    "In wet years the land breathes out,",
    "And a crop of limber pines jumps into the open",
    "Like green pioneers.",
    "In dry years",
    "Beetles kill them with roadmaps",
    "Under the skin.",
    "The land breathes in.",
    "The sun goes down,",
    "And the whole sky cracks like rivermud in drought.",
    "A few trees make it each time,",
    "As if some tide carried them out, away from the others.",
    "They say a tree that falls in timber",
    "Goes down in good company:",
    "Snow drifts in and it all goes soft.",
    "That doesn\u2019t know it\u2019s dead yet.",
    "Those limber pines die standing, lightning-struck, wind broke,",
    "And enough good pitch",
    "For a hermit\u2019s winter.",
    "The cabin stood; the man was long dead.",
    "Packrats nested in the firewood,",
    "And a crowd of medicine bottles held forth on the shelf.",
    "When hermits die",
    "They close their eyes. They never hear",
    "The parson sermonize how somewhere",
    "There is hope where no hope was.",
    "Tanglefoot,",
    "Dead-On-Your-Feet,",
    "A chance to be alone for a chance to be abandoned,",
    "Everything is lost or given."
