    "Pale gold and crumbling with crust",
    "mottled dark, almost bronze,",
    "pieces of honeycomb lie on a plate.",
    "Flecked with the pale paper",
    "of hive, their hexagonal cells",
    "leak into the deepening pool",
    "of amber. On your lips,",
    "against palate, tooth and tongue,",
    "the viscous sugar squeezes",
    "from its chambers, sears sweetness",
    "into your throat until you chew",
    "pulp and wax from a blue city",
    "of bees. Between your teeth",
    "is the blown flower and the flower's",
    "seed. Passport pages stamped",
    "and turning. Death's officious hum.",
    "Both the candle and its anther",
    "of flame. Your own yellow hunger.",
    "Never say you can't take",
    "this world into your mouth."
