    "The poem of the mind in the act of finding",
    "What will suffice. It has not always had",
    "To find: the scene was set; it repeated what",
    "Was in the script.",
    "Then the theatre was changed",
    "To something else. Its past was a souvenir.",
    "It has to be living, to learn the speech of the place.",
    "It has to face the men of the time and to meet",
    "The women of the time. It has to think about war",
    "And it has to find what will suffice. It has",
    "To construct a new stage. It has to be on that stage",
    "And, like an insatiable actor, slowly and",
    "With meditation, speak words that in the ear,",
    "In the delicatest ear of the mind, repeat,",
    "Exactly, that which it wants to hear, at the sound",
    "Of which, an invisible audience listens,",
    "Not to the play, but to itself, expressed",
    "In an emotion as of two people, as of two",
    "Emotions becoming one. The actor is",
    "A metaphysician in the dark, twanging",
    "An instrument, twanging a wiry string that gives",
    "Sounds passing through sudden rightnesses, wholly",
    "Containing the mind, below which it cannot descend,",
    "Beyond which it has no will to rise.",
    "It must",
    "Be the finding of a satisfaction, and may",
    "Be of a man skating, a woman dancing, a woman",
    "Combing. The poem of the act of the mind."
