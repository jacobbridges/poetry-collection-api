    "Children picking up our bones",
    "Will never know that these were once",
    "As quick as foxes on the hill;",
    "And that in autumn, when the grapes",
    "Made sharp air sharper by their smell",
    "These had a being, breathing frost;",
    "And least will guess that with our bones",
    "We left much more, left what still is",
    "The look of things, left what we felt",
    "At what we saw. The spring clouds blow",
    "Above the shuttered mansion house,",
    "Beyond our gate and the windy sky",
    "Cries out a literate despair.",
    "We knew for long the mansion's look",
    "And what we said of it became",
    "A part of what it is ... Children,",
    "Still weaving budded aureoles,",
    "Will speak our speech and never know,",
    "Will say of the mansion that it seems",
    "As if he that lived there left behind",
    "A spirit storming in blank walls,",
    "A dirty house in a gutted world,",
    "A tatter of shadows peaked to white,",
    "Smeared with the gold of the opulent sun."
