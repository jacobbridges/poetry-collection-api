    "The poem that took the place of a mountain.",
    "He breathed its oxygen,",

    "It reminded him how he had needed",
    "A place to go to in his own direction,",
    "How he had recomposed the pines,",
    "Shifted the rocks and picked his way among clouds,",
    "For the outlook that would be right,",
    "Where he would be complete in an unexplained completion:",
    "The exact rock where his inexactnesses",
    "Would discover, at last, the view toward which they had edged,",
    "Where he could lie and, gazing down at the sea,",
    "Recognize his unique and solitary home."
