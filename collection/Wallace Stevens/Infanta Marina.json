    "Her terrace was the sand",
    "And the palms and the twilight.",
    "She made of the motions of her wrist",

    "Of her thought.",
    "The rumpling of the plumes",
    "Of this creature of the evening",
    "Came to be sleights of sails",
    "Over the sea.",
    "And thus she roamed",
    "In the roamings of her fan,",
    "Partaking of the sea,",
    "And of the evening,",
    "As they flowed around",
    "And uttered their subsiding sound."
