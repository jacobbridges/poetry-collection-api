    "A brilliance takes up residence in flaws\u2014",
    "a brilliance all the unchipped faces of design",
    "refuse. The wine collects its starlets",
    "at a lip's fault, sunlight where the nicked",
    "glass angles, and affection where the eye",
    "is least correctable, where arrows of",
    "unquivered light are lodged, where someone",
    "else's eyes have come to be concerned.",
    "For beauty's sake, assault and drive and burn",
    "the devil from the simply perfect sun.",
    "Demand a birthmark on the skin of love,",
    "a tremble in the touch, in come a cry,",
    "and let the silverware of nights be flecked,",
    "the moon pocked to distribute more or less",
    "indwelling alloys of its dim and shine",
    "by nip and tuck, by chance's dance of laws.",
    "The brightness drawn and quartered on a sheet,",
    "the moment cracked upon a bed, will last",
    "as if you soldered them with moon and flux.",
    "And break the bottle of the eye to see",
    "what lights are spun of accident and glass."
