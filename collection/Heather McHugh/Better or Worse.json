    "Daily, the kindergarteners",
    "passed my porch. I loved",
    "their likeness and variety,",
    "their selves in line like little",
    "monosyllables, but huggable\u2014",
    "I wasn't meant",
    "to grab them, ever,",
    "up into actual besmooches or down",
    "into grubbiest tumbles, my lot was not",
    "to have them, in the flesh.",
    "Was it better or worse to let",
    "their lovability go by untouched, and just",
    "watch over their river of ever-",
    "inbraiding relations? I wouldn't",
    "mother them or teach. We couldn't be",
    "each other's others; maybe,",

    "II.",
    "Each toddler had a hand-hold on",
    "a loop of rope, designed to haul",
    "the whole school onward",
    "in the sidewalk stream\u2014",
    "like pickerel through freshets,",
    "at the pull of something else's will, the children",
    "spun and bobbled, three years old and four",
    "(or were they little drunken Buddhas,",
    "buoyant, plump?). They looked",
    "now to the right, now to the sky, and now",
    "toward nothing (nothing was too small)\u2014",
    "they followed a thread of destination,",
    "chain of command, order of actual rope that led",
    "to what? Who knew?",
    "For here and now in one child's eye there was a yellow truck,",
    "and in another's was a burning star; but from my own perspective,",
    "overhead, adult, where trucks and suns had lost their luster,",
    "they were one whole baby-rush toward",
    "a target, toward the law",
    "of targets, fledge",
    "in the wake of an arrowhead;",
    "a bull's-eye bloomed, a red",
    "eight-sided sign. What",
    "did I wish them?",
    "Nothing I foresaw."
