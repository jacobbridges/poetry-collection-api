    "I owe you an explanation.",
    "My first memory isn\u2019t your own",
    "of an empty box. My babyhood cabinets held",
    "a countlessness of cakes, my backyard",
    "rotted into apple glut, windfalls of",
    "money-tree, mouthfuls of fib.",
    "At puberty I liked the locks,",
    "I was the one who made them fast.",
    "The yelling in our hallways was about",
    "lost money, or lost love, but not",
    "lost life. Or so I see it now:",
    "in those days I romanticized",
    "a risk (I thought I\u2019d die",
    "in the alcoholic automobile, die",
    "at the hands of nerveless dentistry). Small hearts",
    "were printed in the checkbook; when my parents called me",
    "dear, they meant expensive.",
    "Where were you in all that time? Out looking for",
    "your father\u2019s body? Making for your mother\u2019s room?",
    "I got my A\u2019s in English, civics,",
    "sweetness and light; you got black eyes, and F\u2019s,",
    "and nowhere fast. By 1967 when we met",
    "(if you could call it making an acquaintance,",
    "rape) I was a mal-adjusted gush, a sucker for",
    "placebos. Walking home from Central Square, I came to have",
    "the good girl\u2019s petty dread: the woman",
    "to whose yard you dragged me might",
    "detect us, and be furious. More than anything else",
    "I wanted no one mad at me. (Propriety,",
    "or was it property, I thought",
    "to guard: myself I gave away.)",
    "And as for you, you had the shakes,",
    "were barely seventeen yourself, too raw",
    "to get it up (I said don\u2019t be afraid,",
    "afraid of what might happen if you failed).",
    "And afterwards, in one of those moments",
    "it\u2019s hard to tell (funny from fatal) you did",
    "a terrible civility: you told me",
    "thanks. I\u2019ll never forget",
    "that moment all my life.",
    "It wasn\u2019t until then, as you",
    "were sheathing it to run,",
    "I saw the knife."
