    "On the phonograph, the voice",
    "of a woman already dead for three",
    "decades, singing of a man",
    "who could make her do anything.",
    "On the table, two fragile",
    "glasses of black wine,",
    "a bottle wrapped in its towel.",
    "It is that room, the one",
    "we took in every city, it is",
    "as I remember: the bed, a block",
    "of moonlight and pillows.",
    "My fingernails, pecks of light",
    "on your thighs.",
    "The stink of the fire escape.",
    "The wet butts of cigarettes",
    "you crushed one after another.",
    "How I watched the morning come",
    "as you slept, more my son",
    "than a man ten years older.",
    "How my breasts feel, years",
    "later, the tongues swishing",
    "in my dress, some yours, some",
    "left by other men.",
    "Since then, I have always",
    "wakened first, I have learned",
    "to leave a bed without being",
    "seen and have stood",
    "at the washbasins, wiping oil",
    "and salt from my skin,",
    "staring at the cupped water",
    "in my two hands.",
    "I have kept everything",
    "you whispered to me then.",
    "I can remember it now as I see you",
    "again, how much tenderness we could",
    "wedge between a stairwell",
    "and a police lock, or as it was,",
    "as it still is, in the voice",
    "of a woman singing of a man",
    "who could make her do anything."
