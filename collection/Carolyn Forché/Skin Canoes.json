    "Swallows carve lake wind,",
    "trailers lined up, fish tins.",
    "The fires of a thousand small camps",
    "spilled on a hillside.",
    "I pull leeks, morels from the soil,",
    "fry chubs from the lake in moonlight.",
    "I hear someone, hear the splash, groan",
    "of a waterpump, wipe my mouth.",
    "Fish grease spits at darkness.",
    "Once I nudged a canoe through that water,",
    "letting its paddle lift, drip.",
    "I was sucked down smaller than the sound",
    "of the dropping, looked out",
    "from where I had vanished."
