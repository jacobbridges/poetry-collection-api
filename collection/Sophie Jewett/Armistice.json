    "The water sings along our keel,",
    "The wind falls to a whispering breath;",
    "I look into your eyes and feel",
    "No fear of life or death;",
    "So near is love, so far away",
    "The losing strife of yesterday.",
    "We watch the swallow skim and dip;",
    "Some magic bids the world be still;",
    "Life stands with finger upon lip;",
    "Love hath his gentle will;",
    "Though hearts have bled, and tears have burned,",
    "The river floweth unconcerned.",
    "We pray the fickle flag of truce",
    "Still float deceitfully and fair;",
    "Our eyes must love its sweet abuse;",
    "This hour we will not care,",
    "Though just beyond to-morrow's gate,",
    "Arrayed and strong, the battle wait."
