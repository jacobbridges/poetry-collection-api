    "Prone on the northern water,",
    "That laps him about the breast,",
    "Like the Sphinx in the sand, forever",
    "The giant lies in rest.",
    "The sails drive swift before him,",
    "And the surf beats at his lip,",
    "But the gray eyes look out seaward",
    "Noting nor wave nor ship.",
    "The centuries drift over,",
    "He marks not with smile nor frown,",
    "Drift over him cloud and sea-gull,",
    "Swallow and thistledown.",
    "I, of the race that passes,",
    "Quick with its hope and its fear,",
    "Lean on his brow and question,",
    "Plead at his senseless ear:",
    "\u201cWhat of thy past unmeasured?",
    "And what of the peoples gone?",
    "What of the sea\u2019s first singing?",
    "What of the primal dawn?",
    "\u201cWhat was the weird that bowed thee?",
    "How did the struggle cease?",
    "Out of what Titan anguish",
    "Issued thy hopeless peace?\u201d",
    "Nothing the pale lips utter,",
    "What hath been, nor what shall be;",
    "Under the brow\u2019s stern shadow,",
    "The gray eyes look to sea.",
    "The blue glows round and over,",
    "Thin-veiled, as it were God\u2019s face;",
    "I feel the breath, the spirit,",
    "That knows nor time nor space.",
    "And my heart grieves for the giant",
    "In his pitiful repose,",
    "Mocked by the vagrant gladness",
    "Of a laggard brier-rose;",
    "Mocked to his face from seaward",
    "By the flash and whirl of wings;",
    "Mocked from the grass above him,",
    "By life that creeps and sings.",
    "I care not for his wisdom,",
    "His secret unconfessed;",
    "I yearn toward rose and cricket,",
    "Ephemeral and blest.",
    "Ah! if he might, how would he",
    "Quicken to love and to tears;",
    "For my immortal minute",
    "Barter his endless years!",
    "He rests on the restless water,",
    "And I on the grasses brown,",
    "Drift over us cloud and sea-gull,",
    "Swallow and thistledown."
