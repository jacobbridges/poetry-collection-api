    "Mown meadows skirt the standing wheat;",
    "I linger, for the hay is sweet,",
    "New-cut and curing in the sun.",
    "Like furrows, straight, the windrows run,",
    "Fallen, gallant ranks that tossed and bent",
    "When, yesterday, the west wind went",
    "A-rioting through grass and grain.",
    "To-day no least breath stirs the plain;",
    "Only the hot air, quivering, yields",
    "Illusive motion to the fields",
    "Where not the slenderest tassel swings.",
    "Across the wheat flash sky-blue wings;",
    "A goldfinch dangles from a tall,",
    "Full-flowered yellow mullein; all",
    "The world seems turning blue and gold.",
    "Unstartled, since, even from of old,",
    "Beauty has brought keen sense of her,",
    "I feel the withering grasses stir;",
    "Along the edges of the wheat,",
    "I hear the rustle of her feet:",
    "And yet I know the whole sea lies,",
    "And half the earth, between our eyes."
