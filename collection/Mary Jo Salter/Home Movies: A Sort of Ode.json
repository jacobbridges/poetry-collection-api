    "Because it hadn't seemed enough,",
    "after a while, to catalogue",
    "more Christmases, the three-layer cakes",
    "ablaze with birthday candles, the blizzard",
    "Billy took a shovel to,",
    "Phil's lawnmower tour of the yard,",
    "the tree forts, the shoot-'em-ups",
    "between the boys in new string ties",
    "and cowboy hats and holsters,",
    "or Mother sticking a bow as big",
    "as Mouseketeer ears in my hair,",
    "my father sometimes turned the gaze",
    "of his camera to subjects more",
    "artistic or universal:",
    "long closeups of a rose's face;",
    "a real-time sunset (nearly an hour);",
    "what surely were some brilliant autumn",
    "leaves before their colors faded",
    "to dry beige on the aging film;",
    "a great deal of pacing, at the zoo,",
    "by polar bears and tigers caged,",
    "he seemed to say, like him.",
    "What happened between him and her",
    "is another story. And just as well",
    "we have no movie of it, only",
    "some unforgiving scowls she gave",
    "through terrifying, ticking silence",
    "when he must have asked her (no",
    "sound track) for a smile.",
    "Still, what I keep yearning for",
    "isn't those generic cherry",
    "blossoms at their peak, or the brave",
    "daffodil after a snowfall,",
    "it's the re-run surprise",
    "of the unshuttered, prefab blanks",
    "of windows at the back of the house,",
    "and how the lines of aluminum",
    "siding are scribbled on with meaning",
    "only for us who lived there;",
    "it's the pair of elephant bookends",
    "I'd forgotten, with the upraised trunks",
    "like handles, and the books they meant",
    "to carry in one block to a future",
    "that scattered all of us.",
    "And look: it's the stoneware mixing bowl",
    "figured with hand-holding dancers",
    "handed down so many years",
    "ago to my own kitchen, still",
    "valueless, unbroken. Here",
    "she's happy, teaching us to dye",
    "the Easter eggs in it, a Grecian",
    "urn of sorts near which\u2014a foster",
    "child of silence and slow time",
    "myself\u2014I smile because she does",
    "and patiently await my turn."
