    "Wind whistling, as it does",
    "in winter, and I think",
    "nothing of it until",
    "it snaps a shutter off",
    "her bedroom window, spins",
    "it over the roof and down",
    "to crash on the deck in back,",
    "like something out of Oz.",
    "We look up, stunned\u2014then glad",
    "to be safe and have a story,",
    "characters in a fable",
    "we only half-believe.",
    "Look, in my surprise",
    "I somehow split a wall,",
    "the last one in the house",
    "we\u2019re making of gingerbread.",
    "We\u2019ll have to improvise:",
    "prop the two halves forward",
    "like an open double door",
    "and with a tube of icing",
    "cement them to the floor.",
    "Five days until Christmas,",
    "and the house cannot be closed.",
    "When she peers into the cold",
    "interior we\u2019ve exposed,",
    "she half-expects to find",
    "three magi in the manger,",
    "a mother and her child.",
    "She half-expects to read",
    "on tablets of gingerbread",
    "a line or two of Scripture,",
    "as she has every morning",
    "inside a dated shutter",
    "on her Advent calendar.",
    "She takes it from the mantel",
    "and coaxes one fingertip",
    "under the perforation,",
    "as if her future hinges",
    "on not tearing off the flap",
    "under which a thumbnail picture",
    "by Raphael or Giorgione,",
    "Hans Memling or David",
    "of apses, niches, archways,",
    "cradles a smaller scene",
    "of a mother and her child,",
    "of the lidded jewel-box",
    "of Mary\u2019s downcast eyes.",
    "cries",
    "the angel of the Lord",
    "to Joseph in a dream,",
    "While",
    "she works to tile the roof",
    "with shingled peppermints,",
    "I wash my sugared hands",
    "and step out to the deck",
    "to lug the shutter in,",
    "a page torn from a book",
    "still blank for the two of us,",
    "a mother and her child."
