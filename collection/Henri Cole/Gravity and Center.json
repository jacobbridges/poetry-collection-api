    "I'm sorry I cannot say I love you when you say",
    "you love me. The words, like moist fingers,",
    "appear before me full of promise but then run away",
    "to a narrow black room that is always dark,",
    "where they are silent, elegant, like antique gold,",
    "devouring the thing I feel. I want the force",
    "of attraction to crush the force of repulsion",
    "and my inner and outer worlds to pierce",
    "one another, like a horse whipped by a man.",
    "I don't want words to sever me from reality.",
    "I don't want to need them. I want nothing",
    "to reveal feeling but feeling\u2014as in freedom,",
    "or the knowledge of peace in a realm beyond,",
    "or the sound of water poured in a bowl."
