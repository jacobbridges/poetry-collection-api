    "There's a black bear",
    "in the apple tree",
    "and he won't come down.",
    "I can hear him panting,",
    "like an athlete.",
    "I can smell the stink",
    "of his body.",
    "Come down, black bear.",
    "Can you hear me?",
    "The mind is the most interesting thing to me;",
    "like the sudden death of the sun,",
    "it seems implausible that darkness will swallow it",
    "or that anything is lost forever there,",
    "like a black bear in a fruit tree,",
    "gulping up sour apples",
    "with dry sucking sounds,",
    "or like us at the pier, somber and tired,",
    "making food from sunlight,",
    "you saying a word, me saying a word, trying hard,",
    "though things were disintegrating.",
    "Still, I wanted you,",
    "your lips on my neck,",
    "your postmodern sexuality.",
    "Forlorn and anonymous:",
    "I didn't want to be that. I could hear",
    "the great barking monsters of the lower waters",
    "calling me forward.",
    "You see, my mind takes me far,",
    "but my heart dreams of return.",
    "Black bear,",
    "with pale-pink tongue",
    "at the center of his face,",
    "is turning his head,",
    "like the face of Christ from life.",
    "Shaking the apple boughs,",
    "he is stronger than I am",
    "and seems so free of passion\u2014",
    "no fear, no pain, no tenderness. I want to be that.",
    "Come down, black bear,",
    "I want to learn the faith of the indifferent."
