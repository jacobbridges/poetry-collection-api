    "Survival is the final offer",
    "that arrives at the eleventh hour",
    "just when pain to the tenth power",
    "would kill you with another ninth degree.",
    "By then, relief strikes you brief as an eighth note;",
    "you wear doom proudly; it's your seventh seal.",
    "But life whispers through your sixth sense",
    "of what might await you in some fifth dimension",
    "where miracle is saved for the fourth quarter.",
    "Tricked, you sigh and rise on the third day.",
    "You know better, but with no second thought,",
    "risk that first step\u2014absurd as first love at first sight\u2014",
    "as if you were back at ground zero, as if it cost",
    "nothing, as if this were not the last laugh."
