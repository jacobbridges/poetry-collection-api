    "I could have anything I wanted",
    "from the maws of the vending machines",
    "that stood watch over the waiting",
    "room of my stepfather\u2019s Shell station.",
    "Larry or Chubbs would fish out keys",
    "with grimy fingers, swing open",
    "the face of the machine, reveal its innards",
    "stacked columns of soda or candy bars.",
    "Outside the constant ding of the bell",
    "as cars pulled in for gas, directions,",
    "air in the tires, a clean windshield,",
    "drivers impatient for destination,",
    "and Chubbs or Larry would dash, leave",
    "me to choose: Planter\u2019s Peanut",
    "Bar or Nestle\u2019s Crunch, Coke",
    "or orange or chocolate pop. Grit",
    "covered that tiny room, layered",
    "on maps in their laddered racks, dusting",
    "the globe of the gumball machine,",
    "sifted over neat rows of motor oil",
    "in silver cans, smudging the white",
    "pages of homework I filled with",
    "painstaking script. I breathed",
    "the stink of petroleum, kicked",
    "at the legs of a yellow plastic",
    "chair with my black and white",
    "school oxfords, waiting for my stepfather",
    "who was supposed to watch me till",
    "my mother got off work. Nine was too",
    "young, she thought, to stay at home alone.",
    "But every day he\u2019d disappear, banged-up",
    "Chevy gone from the lot, the men",
    "in oil-streaked uniforms shrugging excuses.",
    "\u201cAnything she wants,\u201d he\u2019d instructed them,",
    "and I watched the clock as the sky",
    "darkened and the bright shell glowed",
    "against night. My new bra was too tight;",
    "I hugged my three-ring binder to hide my roll",
    "of belly from Larry, from Chubbs, and sucked",
    "the dregs of chocolate pop or lemon-lime."
