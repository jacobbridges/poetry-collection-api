    "No one has touched me for weeks",
    "yet in this drugged, gilt afternoon, late,",
    "when nothing is safe, I\u2019m paralyzed,",
    "as though so wildly desired\u2014passing solo through the garden\u2019s",
    "cinnamon, marigolds, famished roses, where a matted shingle",
    "of the swept-up human hair I begged from a local beauty shop",
    "spread out fruitlessly among the blooms",
    "canes",
    "to keep away the deer might well be a satyr",
    "passed out in the palace\u2019s candied gold\u2014",
    "that something regnant with a strange, godlike power",
    "could not help but reach out from the umbral blue",
    "to tap my white arm. It is a day to die,",
    "the light autoerotic, theatrical, with an unbearable listing,",
    "stalled in cusp, in leonine torpor. Is courage artifice?",
    "As though to answer were within my means.",
    "Or to even move my mouth."
