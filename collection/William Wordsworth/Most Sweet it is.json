    "Most sweet it is with unuplifted eyes",
    "To pace the ground, if path be there or none,",
    "While a fair region round the traveller lies",
    "Which he forbears again to look upon;",
    "Pleased rather with some soft ideal scene,",
    "The work of Fancy, or some happy tone",
    "Of meditation, slipping in between",
    "The beauty coming and the beauty gone.",
    "If Thought and Love desert us, from that day",
    "Let us break off all commerce with the Muse:",
    "With Thought and Love companions of our way,",
    "Whate'er the senses take or may refuse,",
    "The Mind's internal heaven shall shed her dews",
    "Of inspiration on the humblest lay."
