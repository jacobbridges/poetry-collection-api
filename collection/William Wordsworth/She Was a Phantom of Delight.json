    "She was a Phantom of delight",
    "When first she gleamed upon my sight;",
    "A lovely Apparition, sent",
    "To be a moment's ornament;",
    "Her eyes as stars of Twilight fair;",
    "Like Twilight's, too, her dusky hair;",
    "But all things else about her drawn",
    "From May-time and the cheerful Dawn;",
    "A dancing Shape, an Image gay,",
    "To haunt, to startle, and way-lay.",
    "I saw her upon nearer view,",
    "A Spirit, yet a Woman too!",
    "Her household motions light and free,",
    "And steps of virgin-liberty;",
    "A countenance in which did meet",
    "Sweet records, promises as sweet;",
    "A Creature not too bright or good",
    "For human nature's daily food;",
    "For transient sorrows, simple wiles,",
    "Praise, blame, love, kisses, tears, and smiles.",
    "And now I see with eye serene",
    "The very pulse of the machine;",
    "A Being breathing thoughtful breath,",
    "A Traveller between life and death;",
    "The reason firm, the temperate will,",
    "Endurance, foresight, strength, and skill;",
    "A perfect Woman, nobly planned,",
    "To warn, to comfort, and command;",
    "And yet a Spirit still, and bright",
    "With something of angelic light."
