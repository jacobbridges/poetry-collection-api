    "Sweet Highland Girl, a very shower",
    "Of beauty is thy earthly dower!",
    "Twice seven consenting years have shed",
    "Their utmost bounty on thy head:",
    "And these grey rocks; that household lawn;",
    "Those trees, a veil just half withdrawn;",
    "This fall of water that doth make",
    "A murmur near the silent lake;",
    "This little bay; a quiet road",
    "That holds in shelter thy Abode\u0097",
    "In truth together do ye seem",
    "Like something fashioned in a dream;",
    "Such Forms as from their covert peep",
    "When earthly cares are laid asleep!",
    "But, O fair Creature! in the light",
    "Of common day, so heavenly bright,",
    "I bless Thee, Vision as thou art,",
    "I bless thee with a human heart;",
    "God shield thee to thy latest years!",
    "Thee, neither know I, nor thy peers;",
    "And yet my eyes are filled with tears.",
    "With earnest feeling I shall pray",
    "For thee when I am far away:",
    "For never saw I mien, or face,",
    "In which more plainly I could trace",
    "Benignity and home-bred sense",
    "Ripening in perfect innocence.",
    "Here scattered, like a random seed,",
    "Remote from men, Thou dost not need",
    "The embarrassed look of shy distress,",
    "And maidenly shamefacedness:",
    "Thou wear'st upon thy forehead clear",
    "The freedom of a Mountaineer:",
    "A face with gladness overspread!",
    "Soft smiles, by human kindness bred!",
    "And seemliness complete, that sways",
    "Thy courtesies, about thee plays;",
    "With no restraint, but such as springs",
    "From quick and eager visitings",
    "Of thoughts that lie beyond the reach",
    "Of thy few words of English speech:",
    "A bondage sweetly brooked, a strife",
    "That gives thy gestures grace and life!",
    "So have I, not unmoved in mind,",
    "Seen birds of tempest-loving kind\u0097",
    "Thus beating up against the wind.",
    "What hand but would a garland cull",
    "For thee who art so beautiful?",
    "O happy pleasure! here to dwell",
    "Beside thee in some heathy dell;",
    "Adopt your homely ways, and dress,",
    "A Shepherd, thou a Shepherdess!",
    "But I could frame a wish for thee",
    "More like a grave reality:",
    "Thou art to me but as a wave",
    "Of the wild sea; and I would have",
    "Some claim upon thee, if I could,",
    "Though but of common neighbourhood.",
    "What joy to hear thee, and to see!",
    "Thy elder Brother I would be,",
    "Thy Father\u0097anything to thee!",
    "Now thanks to Heaven! that of its grace",
    "Hath led me to this lonely place.",
    "Joy have I had; and going hence",
    "I bear away my recompense.",
    "In spots like these it is we prize",
    "Our Memory, feel that she hath eyes:",
    "Then, why should I be loth to stir?",
    "I feel this place was made for her;",
    "To give new pleasure like the past,",
    "Continued long as life shall last.",
    "Nor am I loth, though pleased at heart,",
    "Sweet Highland Girl! from thee to part;",
    "For I, methinks, till I grow old,",
    "As fair before me shall behold,",
    "As I do now, the cabin small,",
    "The lake, the bay, the waterfall;",
    "And thee, the spirit of them all!"
