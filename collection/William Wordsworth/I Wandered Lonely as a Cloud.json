    "I wandered lonely as a cloud",
    "That floats on high o'er vales and hills,",
    "When all at once I saw a crowd,",
    "A host, of golden daffodils;",
    "Beside the lake, beneath the trees,",
    "Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.",
    "Continuous as the stars that shine",
    "And twinkle on the milky way,",
    "They stretched in never-ending line",
    "Along the margin of a bay:",
    "Ten thousand saw I at a glance,",
    "Tossing their heads in sprightly dance.",
    "The waves beside them danced; but they",
    "Out-did the sparkling waves in glee:",
    "A poet could not but be gay,",
    "In such a jocund company:",
    "I gazed\u2014and gazed\u2014but little thought",
    "What wealth the show to me had brought:",
    "For oft, when on my couch I lie",
    "In vacant or in pensive mood,",
    "They flash upon that inward eye",
    "Which is the bliss of solitude;",
    "And then my heart with pleasure fills,",
    "And dances with the daffodils."
