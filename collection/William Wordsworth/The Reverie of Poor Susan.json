    "At the corner of Wood Street, when daylight appears,",
    "Hangs a Thrush that sings loud, it has sung for three years:",
    "Poor Susan has passed by the spot, and has heard",
    "In the silence of morning the song of the Bird.",
    "'Tis a note of enchantment; what ails her? She sees",
    "A mountain ascending, a vision of trees;",
    "Bright volumes of vapour through Lothbury glide,",
    "And a river flows on through the vale of Cheapside.",
    "Green pastures she views in the midst of the dale,",
    "Down which she so often has tripped with her pail;",
    "And a single small cottage, a nest like a dove's,",
    "The one only dwelling on earth that she loves.",
    "She looks, and her heart is in heaven: but they fade,",
    "The mist and the river, the hill and the shade:",
    "The stream will not flow, and the hill will not rise,",
    "And the colours have all passed away from her eyes!"
