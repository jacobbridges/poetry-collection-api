    "Mother! whose virgin bosom was uncrost",
    "With the least shade of thought to sin allied.",
    "Woman! above all women glorified,",
    "Our tainted nature's solitary boast;",
    "Purer than foam on central ocean tost;",
    "Brighter than eastern skies at daybreak strewn",
    "With fancied roses, than the unblemished moon",
    "Before her wane begins on heaven's blue coast;",
    "Thy image falls to earth. Yet some, I ween,",
    "Not unforgiven the suppliant knee might bend,",
    "As to a visible Power, in which did blend",
    "All that was mixed and reconciled in thee",
    "Of mother's love with maiden purity,",
    "Of high with low, celestial with terrene!"
