    "I heard a thousand blended notes,",
    "While in a grove I sate reclined,",
    "In that sweet mood when pleasant thoughts",
    "Bring sad thoughts to the mind.",
    "To her fair works did Nature link",
    "The human soul that through me ran;",
    "And much it grieved my heart to think",
    "What man has made of man.",
    "Through primrose tufts, in that green bower,",
    "The periwinkle trailed its wreaths;",
    "And \u2019tis my faith that every flower",
    "Enjoys the air it breathes.",
    "The birds around me hopped and played,",
    "Their thoughts I cannot measure:\u2014",
    "But the least motion which they made",
    "It seemed a thrill of pleasure.",
    "The budding twigs spread out their fan,",
    "To catch the breezy air;",
    "And I must think, do all I can,",
    "That there was pleasure there.",
    "If this belief from heaven be sent,",
    "If such be Nature\u2019s holy plan,",
    "Have I not reason to lament",
    "What man has made of man?"
