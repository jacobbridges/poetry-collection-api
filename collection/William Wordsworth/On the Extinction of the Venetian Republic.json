    "Once did She hold the gorgeous east in fee;",
    "And was the safeguard of the west: the worth",
    "Of Venice did not fall below her birth,",
    "Venice, the eldest Child of Liberty.",
    "She was a maiden City, bright and free;",
    "No guile seduced, no force could violate;",
    "And, when she took unto herself a Mate,",
    "She must espouse the everlasting Sea.",
    "And what if she had seen those glories fade,",
    "Those titles vanish, and that strength decay;",
    "Yet shall some tribute of regret be paid",
    "When her long life hath reached its final day:",
    "Men are we, and must grieve when even the Shade",
    "Of that which once was great is passed away."
