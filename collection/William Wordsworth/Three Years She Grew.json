    "Three years she grew in sun and shower,",
    "Then Nature said, \"A lovelier flower",
    "On earth was never sown;",
    "This Child I to myself will take;",
    "She shall be mine, and I will make",
    "A Lady of my own.",
    "\"Myself will to my darling be",
    "Both law and impulse: and with me",
    "The Girl, in rock and plain,",
    "In earth and heaven, in glade and bower,",
    "Shall feel an overseeing power",
    "To kindle or restrain.",
    "\"She shall be sportive as the fawn",
    "That wild with glee across the lawn",
    "Or up the mountain springs;",
    "And hers shall be the breathing balm,",
    "And hers the silence and the calm",
    "Of mute insensate things.",
    "\"The floating clouds their state shall lend",
    "To her; for her the willow bend;",
    "Nor shall she fail to see",
    "Even in the motions of the Storm",
    "Grace that shall mould the Maiden's form",
    "By silent sympathy.",
    "\"The stars of midnight shall be dear",
    "To her; and she shall lean her ear",
    "In many a secret place",
    "Where rivulets dance their wayward round,",
    "And beauty born of murmuring sound",
    "Shall pass into her face.",
    "\"And vital feelings of delight",
    "Shall rear her form to stately height,",
    "Her virgin bosom swell;",
    "Such thoughts to Lucy I will give",
    "While she and I together live",
    "Here in this happy dell.\"",
    "Thus Nature spake\u2014The work was done\u2014",
    "How soon my Lucy's race was run!",
    "She died, and left to me",
    "This heath, this calm and quiet scene;",
    "The memory of what has been,",
    "And never more will be."
