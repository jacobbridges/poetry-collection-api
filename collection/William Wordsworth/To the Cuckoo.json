    "O blithe New-comer! I have heard,",
    "I hear thee and rejoice.",
    "O Cuckoo! shall I call thee Bird,",
    "Or but a wandering Voice?",
    "While I am lying on the grass",
    "Thy twofold shout I hear;",
    "From hill to hill it seems to pass,",
    "At once far off, and near.",
    "Though babbling only to the Vale",
    "Of sunshine and of flowers,",
    "Thou bringest unto me a tale",
    "Of visionary hours.",
    "Thrice welcome, darling of the Spring!",
    "Even yet thou art to me",
    "No bird, but an invisible thing,",
    "A voice, a mystery;",
    "The same whom in my school-boy days",
    "I listened to; that Cry",
    "Which made me look a thousand ways",
    "In bush, and tree, and sky.",
    "To seek thee did I often rove",
    "Through woods and on the green;",
    "And thou wert still a hope, a love;",
    "Still longed for, never seen.",
    "And I can listen to thee yet;",
    "Can lie upon the plain",
    "And listen, till I do beget",
    "That golden time again.",
    "O bless\u00e8d Bird! the earth we pace",
    "Again appears to be",
    "An unsubstantial, faery place;",
    "That is fit home for Thee!"
