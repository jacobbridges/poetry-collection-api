    "It is a beauteous evening, calm and free,",
    "The holy time is quiet as a Nun",
    "Breathless with adoration; the broad sun",
    "Is sinking down in its tranquility;",
    "The gentleness of heaven broods o'er the Sea;",
    "Listen! the mighty Being is awake,",
    "And doth with his eternal motion make",
    "A sound like thunder\u2014everlastingly.",
    "Dear child! dear Girl! that walkest with me here,",
    "If thou appear untouched by solemn thought,",
    "Thy nature is not therefore less divine:",
    "Thou liest in Abraham's bosom all the year;",
    "And worshipp'st at the Temple's inner shrine,",
    "God being with thee when we know it not."
