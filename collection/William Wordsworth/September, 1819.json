    "Departing summer hath assumed",
    "An aspect tenderly illumed,",
    "The gentlest look of spring;",
    "That calls from yonder leafy shade",
    "Unfaded, yet prepared to fade,",
    "A timely carolling.",
    "No faint and hesitating trill,",
    "Such tribute as to winter chill",
    "The lonely redbreast pays!",
    "Clear, loud, and lively is the din,",
    "From social warblers gathering in",
    "Their harvest of sweet lays.",
    "Nor doth the example fail to cheer",
    "Me, conscious that my leaf is sere,",
    "And yellow on the bough:\u2014",
    "Fall, rosy garlands, from my head!",
    "Ye myrtle wreaths, your fragrance shed",
    "Around a younger brow!",
    "Yet will I temperately rejoice;",
    "Wide is the range, and free the choice",
    "Of undiscordant themes;",
    "Which, haply, kindred souls may prize",
    "Not less than vernal ecstasies,",
    "And passion's feverish dreams.",
    "For deathless powers to verse belong,",
    "And they like Demi-gods are strong",
    "On whom the Muses smile;",
    "But some their function have disclaimed,",
    "Best pleased with what is aptliest framed",
    "To enervate and defile.",
    "Not such the initiatory strains",
    "Committed to the silent plains",
    "In Britain's earliest dawn:",
    "Trembled the groves, the stars grew pale,",
    "While all-too-daringly the veil",
    "Of nature was withdrawn!",
    "Nor such the spirit-stirring note",
    "When the live chords Alc\u00e6us smote,",
    "Inflamed by sense of wrong;",
    "Woe! woe to Tyrants! from the lyre",
    "Broke threateningly, in sparkles dire",
    "Of fierce vindictive song.",
    "And not unhallowed was the page",
    "By wing\u00e8d Love inscribed, to assuage",
    "The pangs of vain pursuit;",
    "Love listening while the Lesbian Maid",
    "With finest touch of passion swayed",
    "Her own \u00c6olian lute.",
    "O ye, who patiently explore",
    "The wreck of Herculanean lore,",
    "What rapture! could ye seize",
    "Some Theban fragment, or unroll",
    "One precious, tender-hearted scroll",
    "Of pure Simonides.",
    "That were, indeed, a genuine birth",
    "Of poesy; a bursting forth",
    "Of genius from the dust:",
    "What Horace gloried to behold,",
    "What Maro loved, shall we enfold?",
    "Can haughty Time be just!"
