    "The cruelest thing I did to my dog",
    "wasn\u2019t to ignore his barking for water",
    "when his tongue hung like a deflated balloon",
    "or to disregard his chronic need for a belly rub",
    "but to teach him to shake hands,",
    "a trick that took weeks of treats, his dark eyes",
    "like Greek olives, moist with desire.",
    "I made him sit, another injustice,",
    "and allowed him to want the nuggets enough",
    "to please me.",
    ", I said.",
    "touching the back of his right leg",
    "until he lifted it, his saliva trickling",
    "from soft jowls, my hand wet with his hunger.",
    "Mistress of the biscuit, I ruffled his ears",
    "and said",
    "until he got it. Before long,",
    "he raised his paw, shook me until he got",
    "the treat, the rub, the water in a chilled silver bowl,",
    "the wilderness in him gone, his eyes still lit with longing."
