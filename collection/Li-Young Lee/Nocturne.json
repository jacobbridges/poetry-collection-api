    "That scraping of iron on iron when the wind",
    "rises, what is it? Something the wind won\u2019t",
    "quit with, but drags back and forth.",
    "Sometimes faint, far, then suddenly, close, just",
    "beyond the screened door, as if someone there",
    "squats in the dark honing his wares against",
    "my threshold. Half steel wire, half metal wing,",
    "nothing and anything might make this noise",
    "of saws and rasps, a creaking and groaning",
    "of bone-growth, or body-death, marriages of rust,",
    "or ore abraded. Tonight, something bows",
    "that should not bend. Something stiffens that should",
    "slide. Something, loose and not right,",
    "rakes or forges itself all night."
