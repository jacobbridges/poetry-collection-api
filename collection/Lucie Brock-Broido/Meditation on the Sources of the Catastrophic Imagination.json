  "text": [
    "Green as alchemy and even more scarce, little can be known",
    "Of the misfortunes of a saint condemned to turn great sorrows",
    "Into greater egrets, ice-bound and irrevocable. The wings were left ajar",
    "At the altar where I've knelt all night, trembling, leaning, rough",
    "As sugar raw, and sweet. From the outside, peering in, it would seem",
    "My life had been smooth as a Prussian ship gliding on the bridegroom",
    "Of her Baltic waters in a season of no wind. Tinny empire,",
    "Neighborhood of Bokhara silks, were you to go, I would stop\u2014simply",
    "As a pilgrim putting down his cup. Most of my life,",
    "I had consorted with the unspeakable, longing to put my mouth",
    "On it. I was just imagining. I can be",
    "Resumed. Some nights, I paint into the scene two Doves,",
    "I being alternately one and then the other, calling myself by my kind.",
    "In the living will if it says:",
    "Please.",
    "Do not resume me then."
