    "Wanting is reposed and plump",
    "As the hands of a Romanov child",

    "Paused before the little war begins.",
    "This one will be guttural, this war.",
    "How is it possible to still be startled",
    "As I am by the oblong silhouette of the coiling",
    "Index finger of a pending death.",
    "No longer will",
    "Wooing be the wondrous",
    "Thing; instead, a homely domesticity, constant",
    "As a field of early rye and yarrow-light.",
    "What one is fit to stand is not what one is",
    "Given, necessarily, and not this night."
