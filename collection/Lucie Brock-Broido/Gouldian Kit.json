    "What makes you think I\u2019m an eccentric, he said, in London",
    "To the rag of the reporters who had gathered to report",
    "On his eccentricities \u2014 the tin sink light enough for traveling, but",
    "Deep enough to swallow his exquisite hands in water filled with ice.",
    "A budgerigar accompanies, perched atop the fugue of Hindemith.",
    "You are trembling now like the librarian reading",
    "To herself out loud in her Arctic room",
    "Composed entirely of snow.",
    "A broadcast (high fidelity) bound by the quiet of the land and",
    "The Mennonite who told him",
    "We are in this world, but are not of this world,",
    "You see. From the notebook of your partial list of symptoms, phobias:",
