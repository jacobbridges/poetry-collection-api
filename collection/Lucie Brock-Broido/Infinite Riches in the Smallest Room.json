    "Silk spool of the recluse as she confects her eventual mythomania.",
    "If it is written down, you can't rescind it.",
    "Spoon and pottage bowl. You",
    "starving. Come closer now.",
    "What if I were gone and the wind still reeks of hyacinth, what then.",
    "Who will I be: a gaudy arrangement of nuclei, an apple-size gray circle",
    "On the tunic of a Jew, preventing more bad biological accidents",
    "From breeding-in. I have not bred-",
    "In. Each child still has one lantern inside lit. May the Mother not",
    "Blow her children out. She says her hair is thinning, thin.",
    "The flowerbed is black, sumptuous in emptiness.",
    "Blue-footed mushrooms line the walkway to my door. I would as soon",
    "Die as serve them in a salad to the man I love. We lie down",

    "The rims of wounds have wounds as well.",
    "Sphinx, small print, you are inscrutable.",
    "On the roads, blue thistles, barely",
    "Visible by night, and, by these, you may yet find your way home."
