    "I was lying loose from God. Strange is it not best",
    "Beloved, in the New World, in this skinny life,",
    "Intemperate with chance, my spirit quickens",
    "For the fall\u2019s estate. In India, the half",
    "Hour is the hour, we were like that then\u2014",
    "Jammed wrong & wrong in the diurnal",
    "Mangy chambers of our carnall",
    "Hearts, the rose robes rustling loose as velvet",
    "Curtains at the stage prow, passing",
    "Into the strange salt air of an Indian",
    "Ocean, hoarding kindling, heading",
    "West with hours, later than we might",
    "Have known, counting tins of meats & oil left,",
    "If they should lose or last the night."
