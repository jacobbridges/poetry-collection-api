    "this is the track I've had on REPEAT all afternoon: she is butterfly",
    "brilliant riband, rice flour face, silken, even her voice a sashed kimono",
    "if I were foolish like her:",
    "but aren't I foolish like her",
    "spotting the coil of smoke and the billowed sail",
    "against the verge of sky",
    "simple on the rise surveying the anchorage: simple me, signal me",
    "dreading the confident assumption of return, dreading more",
    "uncertain tone to come, the thinning notes, performance",
    "too close to my own impatient\u2014swells, a surge: sick wind",
    "but the emotion is, after all, an artfully conjured gesture",
    "arranged marriage between a past ache and frail woodwinds",
    "I could skip ahead",
    "could break the inconsolable loop",
    "of harbor, waiting, overlook, waiting, inevitable waning eye",
    "troubled robins, once more in the handkerchief trees",
    "once more, brief aquarelle of triplet lilies, blue as willowware",
    "in that interval before his embrace falters, stuck, founders",
    "[shuffle play] such a pitch of tenderness in the voice",
    "such an awful lot of noise"
