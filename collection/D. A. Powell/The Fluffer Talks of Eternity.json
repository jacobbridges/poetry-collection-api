    "I can only give you back what you imagine.",
    "I am a soulless man. When I take you",
    "into my mouth, it is not my mouth. It is",
    "an unlit pit, an aperture opened just enough",
    "in the pinhole camera to capture the shade.",
    "I have caused you to rise up to me, and I",
    "have watched as you rose and waned.",
    "Our times together have been innumerable. Still,",
    "like a Capistrano swallow, you come back.",
    "You understand: I understand you. Understand",
    "each jiggle and tug. Your pudgy, mercurial wad.",
    "I am simply a hand inexhaustible as yours",
    "could never be. You\u2019re nevertheless prepared to shoot.",
    "If I could I\u2019d finish you. Be more than just your rag."
