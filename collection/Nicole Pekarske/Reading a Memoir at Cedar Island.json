    "We arrive eight hours before morning",
    "but the Sound luminesces enough to gloss",
    "jabbed brushstrokes of cedar, the strand",
    "prickled with fringes of eelgrass,",
    "and the world's baby teeth ground down",
    "to this pall of sand.",
    "It's gusting so strong I can barely pee straight \u2014",
    "You can see in each stunted and strung-out",
    "live oak the shape of the wind's hands.",
    "On this last stand before the Outer Banks",
    "Sharon makes camp while I pay twenty quarters",
    "to shelter stunned",
    "and out-of-context. Such bare slubs of land",
    "the memoir I'm reading calls",
    ".",
    "The groove fits my tongue",
    "so for forty more pages I keep the light on,",
    "pulled by a man oaring",
    "his way through childhood to a stung",
    "and moondamp first place, all slap and vowel",
    "and grunt-pine punctuation, the no-way-satisfied",
    "lessing & moring",
    "of the tideshore. I knew in advance of reason",
    "this freight of rain, salt in my hair.",
    "That child I was, what was she mourning",
    "before death charged his first fare?",
    "We wake and hurry to slip our moorings.",
    "The ferry's there."
