    "I see myself in the shadows of a leaf",
    "compressed to the green blades growing",
    "to a point like the shards of miles of mirrors",
    "falling and cracking to perfect gardens.",
    "I never inspect the withered assumption",
    "of my face\u2019s petty dialogue in raindrops,",
    "the deceptive spreading of the words",
    "oozing from the skin to the edges of water",
    "etched on the ground by gravity and wishing.",
    "Passing for the seriousness of my eye,",
    "platitudes of my white collar or",
    "the perfect posture of my lips, it skirts",
    "from the leaves of the plant hiding me",
    "and sits stoic like stone in my pupil,",
    "mute and unassuming, like Rashi.",
    "To gather myself I will swim naked",
    "in the wind, bending my blind elbows",
    "in circles, stopping now to dance",
    "like the cherubic gold on the ark,",
    "and gather myself from the particles",
    "of this excitement another structure,",
    "one closely resembling the beginning."
