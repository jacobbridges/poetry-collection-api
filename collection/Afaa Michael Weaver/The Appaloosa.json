    "The one horse you gave me",
    "you took back when she went insane,",
    "when she began to chew wood",
    "instead of the expensive grain",
    "we bought from the feed store,",
    "the grain that had the sweet smell",
    "of molasses and was good for even",
    "us to chew. She turned into",
    "an ugly thing with her wild thoughts,",
    "and I forgot about the beauty",
    "expected of her when her blanket",
    "filled out and complemented",
    "her chestnut body and the name",
    "the Nez Perc\u00e9 gave her. She rotted",
    "and began to stink of promises",
    "gone wrong, of gods avenging",
    "their defilement. A man who knew",
    "what to do with useless horses",
    "came and took her away in",
    "a wooden trailer she tried to chew,",
    "and my tears welled up in huge drops",
    "before they splattered on the ground,",
    "as I trembled and realized I would have",
    "to give up her own ghost for her,",
    "ghost which she did not have, ghost",
    "which she came here beautifully without."
