    "We have had our lives.",
    "The reservoir visible",
    "In the window beside our elbows, and the willow",
    "Branches trailing at our stop",
    "Are the nature we leave",
    "Behind us gladly, since it has no place",
    "For all we have recently learned: that sex",
    "Is temporary, help",
    "Ours to hand down now, and materials science",
    "Not the only kind. We thank",
    "Calm, careful Minerva, goddess",
    "Of adults, who for so many years took us",
    "To school: her voice the timbre of fretless bass,",
    "Her eyes the color of pencil lead, she taught",
    "Us how to behave in order to have our rewards",
    "In twenty years. We have them, and if we wish",
    "Too often, this fall, to have led another life",
    "We do not mean that we would give up ours:",
    "Though we stand in a row and sway",
    "Before an obstructed view, we are able to find",
    "Initials outlined in the crosshatched trees,",
    "And pebbles\u2014calculi\u2014around our ponds",
    "And cherish them; we like to watch the roads",
    "Along which the perennial pollen sifts down",
    "As finely as ever, making a soft powder",
    "Of brass amid the troughs in softball fields.",
    "Our skills are finally in demand.",
    "If you mock us, Pan,",
    "In whom we also believe, do it",
    "As gently as you can."
