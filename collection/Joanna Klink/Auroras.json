    "It began in a foyer of evenings",
    "The evenings left traces of glass in the trees",
    "A book and a footpath we followed",
    "Under throat-pipes of birds",
    "We moved through a room of leaves",
    "Thin streams of silver buried under our eyes",
    "A field of white clover buried under our eyes",
    "Or a river we stopped at to watch",
    "The wind cross it, recross it",
    "Room into room you paused",
    "Where once on a stoop we leaned back",
    "Talking late into daylight",
    "The morning trees shook off twilight",
    "Opening and closing our eyes auroras",
    "Beyond groves and flora we followed a road",
    "Dotted with polished brown bottles,",
    "Scoured furrows, a wood emptied of trees",
    "It was enough to hollow us out",
    "The evenings left grasses half-wild at our feet",
    "Branches with spaces for winds",
    "The earth changes",
    "The way we speak to each other has changed",
    "As for a long while we stood in a hall full of exits",
    "Listening for a landscape beyond us"
