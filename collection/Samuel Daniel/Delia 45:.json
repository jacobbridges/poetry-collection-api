    "Care-charmer Sleep, son of the sable Night,",
    "Brother to Death, in silent darkness born:",
    "Relieve my languish, and restore the light,",
    "With dark forgetting of my cares, return;",
    "And let the day be time enough to mourn",
    "The shipwreck of my ill-adventur'd youth:",
    "Let waking eyes suffice to wail their scorn,",
    "Without the torment of the night's untruth.",
    "Cease dreams, th' imagery of our day-desires,",
    "To model forth the passions of the morrow;",
    "Never let rising sun approve you liars,",
    "To add more grief to aggravate my sorrow.",
    "Still let me sleep, embracing clouds in vain;",
    "And never wake to feel the day's disdain."
