    "Fair is my love, and cruel as she's fair:",
    "Her brow shades frowns although her eyes are sunny,",
    "Her smiles are lightning though her pride despair,",
    "And her disdains are gall, her favours honey;",
    "A modest maid, deck'd with a blush of honour,",
    "Whose feet do tread green paths of youth and love,",
    "The wonder of all eyes that look upon her:",
    "Sacred on earth, design'd a saint above.",
    "Chastity and beauty, which were deadly foes,",
    "Live reconciled friends within her brow;",
    "And had she pity to conjoin with those,",
    "Then who had heard the plaints I utter now?",
    "For had she not been fair and thus unkind,",
    "My muse had slept, and none had known my mind."
