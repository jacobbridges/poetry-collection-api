    "Suddenly with a shy, sad grace",
    "She turns to me her lighted face,",
    "And I, who hear some idle phrase,",
    "Watch how her wry lips move",
    "And guess that the poor words they frame",
    "Mean naught for they would speak the same",
    "Message I read in the dark flame",
    "Within her eyes, which say, \u201cI love.\u201d",
    "I, that have heard the deep voice break",
    "Into a sing-song, sobbing shake,",
    "Whose flutter made my being quake,",
    "What ears have I for women's cries?",
    "I, that have seen the turquoise glaze",
    "Fixed in the blue and quivering gaze",
    "Of one whom cocaine cannot daze,",
    "How can I yield to women's eyes?",
    "I, that have held strong hands which palter,",
    "Borne the full weight of limbs that falter,",
    "Bound live flesh on the surgeon's altar,",
    "What need have I of women's hand?",
    "I, that have felt the dead's embrace?",
    "I, whose arms were his resting-place?",
    "I, that have kissed a dead man's face?",
    "Ah, but how should you understand?"
