    "Presently at our touch the teacup stirred,",
    "Then circled lazily about",
    "From A to Z. The first voice heard",
    "(If they are voices, these mute spellers-out)",
    "Was that of an engineer",
    "Originally from Cologne.",
    "Dead in his 22nd year",
    "Of cholera in Cairo, he had",
    "NO HAPPINESS. He once met Goethe, though.",
    "Goethe had told him:",
    ".",
    "Our blind hound whined. With that, a horde",
    "Of voices gathered above the Ouija board,",
    "Some childish and, you might say, blurred",
    "By sleep; one little boy",
    "Named Will, reluctant possibly in a ruff",
    "Like a large-lidded page out of El Greco, pulled",
    "Back the arras for that next voice,",
    "Cold and portentous:",
    "FLEE THIS HOUSE. OTTO VON THURN UND TAXIS.",
    "OBEY. YOU HAVE NO CHOICE.",
    "Frightened, we stopped; but tossed",
    "Till sunrise striped the rumpled sheets with gold.",
    "Each night since then, the moon waxes,",
    "Small insects flit round a cold torch",
    "We light, that sends them pattering to the porch . . .",
    "But no real Sign. New voices come,",
    "Dictate addresses, begging us to write;",
    "Some warn of lives misspent, and all of doom",
    "In ways that so exhilarate",
    "We are sleeping sound of late.",
    "Last night the teacup shattered in a rage.",
    "Indeed, we have grown nonchalant",
    "Towards the other world. In the gloom here,",
    "our elbows on the cleared",
    "Table, we talk and smoke, pleased to be stirred",
    "Rather by buzzings in the jasmine, by the drone",
    "Of our own voices and poor blind Rover\u2019s wheeze,",
    "Than by those clamoring overhead,",
    "Obsessed or piteous, for a commitment",
    "We still have wit to postpone",
    "Because, once looked at lit",
    "By the cold reflections of the dead",
    "Risen extinct but irresistible,",
    "Our lives have never seemed more full, more real,",
    "Nor the full moon more quick to chill."
