    "There are rooms that know you, rooms you know",
    "& can name, rooms that rise & stutter",
    "into view if you stare long enough.",
    "Rooms where nothing happened",
    "but in your head, where the world went on",
    "apart from you, you trying to rise to it.",
    "Rooms with walls of white blocks,",
    "one window, the only sound the bang",
    "bang banging of the headboard",
    "against the wall, your bed still.",
    "The room where the bed fell on you,",
    "the room where the hand going down",
    "was not your own, the groping tongue",
    "the proof. The room you talked your way",
    "out of, four men of monosyllables,",
    "thick arms & necks flushed pink,",
    "closing in, emptying the air between.",
    "The room where you were walked in on,",
    "the room where you were the walker,",
    "both times the last time in that room.",
    "The room with no door, a woman",
    "across the threshold, you crawling to her,",
    "over her to the bathroom to press your cheek",
    "against the white, your name",
    "an indictment among the stalls.",
    "The room the sun never touched,",
    "the sound of cars dropping you to sleep,",
    "your pupils large & hungry for light."
