    "Some say it\u2019s in the reptilian dance",
    "of the purple-tongued sand goanna,",
    "for there the magnificent translation",
    "of tenacity into bone and grace occurs.",
    "And some declare it to be an expansive",
    "desert\u2014solid rust-orange rock",
    "like dusk captured on earth in stone\u2014",
    "simply for the perfect contrast it provides",
    "to the blue-grey ridge of rain",
    "in the distant hills.",
    "Some claim the harmonics of shifting",
    "electron rings to be most rare and some",
    "the complex motion of seven sandpipers",
    "bisecting the arcs and pitches",
    "of come and retreat over the mounting",
    "hayfield.",
    "Others, for grandeur, choose the terror",
    "of lightning peals on prairies or the tall",
    "collapsing cathedrals of stormy seas,",
    "because there they feel dwarfed",
    "and appropriately helpless; others select",
    "the serenity of that ceiling/cellar",
    "of stars they see at night on placid lakes,",
    "because there they feel assured",
    "and universally magnanimous.",
    "But it is the dark emptiness contained",
    "in every next moment that seems to me",
    "the most singularly glorious gift,",
    "that void which one is free to fill",
    "with processions of men bearing burning",
    "cedar knots or with parades of blue horses,",
    "belled and ribboned and stepping sideways,",
    "with tumbling white-faced mimes or companies",
    "of black-robed choristers; to fill simply",
    "with hammered silver teapots or kiln-dried",
    "crockery, tangerine and almond custards,",
    "polonaises, polkas, whittling sticks, wailing",
    "walls; that space large enough to hold all",
    "invented blasphemies and pieties, 10,000",
    "definitions of god and more, never fully",
    "filled, never."
