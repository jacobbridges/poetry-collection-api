    "Wisdom and Valour, Faith,",
    "Justice,\u2014the lofty names",
    "Of virtue\u2019s quest and prize,\u2014",
    "What is each but a cold wraith",
    "Until it lives in a man",
    "And looks thro\u2019 a man\u2019s eyes?",
    "On Chivalry as I muse,",
    "The spirit so high and clear",
    "It cannot soil with aught",
    "It meets of foul misuse;",
    "It turns wherever burns",
    "The flame of a brave thought;",
    "And wheresoever the moan",
    "Of the helpless and betrayed",
    "Calls, from near or far,",
    "It replies as to its own",
    "Need, and is armed and goes",
    "Straight to its sure pole\u2014star;\u2014",
    "No legendary knight",
    "Renowned in an ancient cause",
    "I warm my thought upon.",
    "There comes to the mind\u2019s sight",
    "One whom I knew, whose hand",
    "Grasped mine: George Calderon.",
    "Him now as of old I see",
    "Carrying his head with an air",
    "Courteous and virile,",
    "With the charm of a nature free,",
    "Daring, resourceful, prompt,",
    "In his frank and witty smile.",
    "By Oxford towers and streams",
    "Who shone among us all",
    "In body and brain so bold?",
    "Who shaped so firm his themes",
    "Crystal\u2014hard in debate?",
    "And who hid a heart less cold?",
    "Lover of strange tongues,",
    "Whether in snowy Russia,",
    "Or tropic island bowers",
    "Listening to the songs",
    "Of the soft\u2014eyed islanders,",
    "Crowned with Tahitian flowers,",
    "A maker of friends he went.",
    "Yet who divined him wholly",
    "Or his secret chivalries?\u2014",
    "Was all that accomplishment,",
    "Wit, alertness, grace,",
    "But a kind of blithe disguise?",
    "Restless in curious thought",
    "And subtle exploring mind,",
    "He mixt his modern vein",
    "With a strain remotely brought",
    "From an older blood than ours,",
    "Proud loyalties of Spain.",
    "Was it the soul of a sword?",
    "For a bright sword leapt from sheath",
    "Upon that August day",
    "When war\u2019s full thunder stored",
    "Over Europe, suddenly crashed,",
    "And a choice upon each man lay.",
    "Others had left their youth",
    "In the taming years; and some",
    "Doubted; some made moan.",
    "To meet the peril of truth",
    "With aught but a gay courage",
    "Was not for Calderon.",
    "Wounded from France he came.",
    "His spirit halted not;",
    "In that long battle afar,",
    "Fruitless in all but fame,",
    "Athos and Ida saw",
    "Where sank his gallant star.",
    "O well could I set my mood",
    "To a mournful falling measure",
    "For a friend dear and dead!",
    "And well could memory brood",
    "Singing of youth\u2019s delight",
    "And lost adventure fled.",
    "But that so fearless friend",
    "With his victorious smile",
    "My mourning mood has chid.",
    "He went to the very end;",
    "He counted not the cost;",
    "What he believed, he did."
