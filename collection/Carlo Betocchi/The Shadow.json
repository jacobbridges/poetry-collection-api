    "One spring day I saw",
    "the shadow of a strawberry tree",
    "lying on the moor",
    "like a shy lamb asleep.",
    "Its heart was far away,",
    "suspended in the sky,",
    "brown in a brown veil,",
    "in the sun\u2019s eye.",
    "The shadow played in the wind,",
    "moving there alone",
    "to make the tree content.",
    "Here and there it shone.",
    "It knew no pain, no haste,",
    "wanting only to feel morning,",
    "then noon, then the slow-paced",
    "journey of evening.",
    "Among all the shadows always",
    "joining eternal shadow,",
    "shrouding the earth in falseness,",
    "I loved this steady shadow.",
    "And thus, at times, it descends",
    "among us, this meek semblance,",
    "and lies down, as if drained,",
    "in grass and in patience."
