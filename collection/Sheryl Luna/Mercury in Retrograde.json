    "The day ended badly with a broken ankle,",
    "a jinxed printer, and a dead car. The dry yellow grass",
    "against the sunset saved me. Roosters",
    "pranced across a lawn of shit, proudly plumed",
    "in black feathers, bobbing before the gray goats.",
    "It was the first day I saw god in the quiet,",
    "and found a mustard seed was",
    "small.",
    "There I had been for years cursing \u201cwhy?\u201d",
    "and all the gold in the sun fell upon me.",
    "There was a white mare in the midst",
    "of brown smog, majestic in the refinery",
    "clouds. Even the radio wouldn\u2019t work!",
    "My mother limps and her hair falls out.",
    "The faithful drive white Chevy trucks",
    "or yellow Camrys, and I\u2019m here golden",
    "on the smoking shock-less bus.",
    "I lost language in this want, each poem",
    "dust, Spanish fluttered",
    "as music across the desert, even weeds",
    "tumbled unloved. The police sirens seared",
    "the coming night, dogs howled helplessly",
    "sad.",
    "Lo I walk the valley of death, love",
    "lingers in my hard eyes. Ma\u00f1ana never",
    "comes just right. I mend myself in the folds",
    "of paper songs, ring my paper bells",
    "for empty success.",
    "if I sing long enough, I\u2019ll grow dreamlike",
    "and find a flock of pigeons, white under",
    "wings lifting awkward bodies like doves",
    "across the silky blue-white sky."
