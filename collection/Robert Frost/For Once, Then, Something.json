    "Others taunt me with having knelt at well-curbs",
    "Always wrong to the light, so never seeing",
    "Deeper down in the well than where the water",
    "Gives me back in a shining surface picture",
    "Me myself in the summer heaven godlike",
    "Looking out of a wreath of fern and cloud puffs.",
    ", when trying with chin against a well-curb,",
    "I discerned, as I thought, beyond the picture,",
    "Through the picture, a something white, uncertain,",
    "Something more of the depths\u2014and then I lost it.",
    "Water came to rebuke the too clear water.",
    "One drop fell from a fern, and lo, a ripple",
    "Shook whatever it was lay there at bottom,",
    "Blurred it, blotted it out. What was that whiteness?",
    "Truth? A pebble of quartz? For once, then, something."
