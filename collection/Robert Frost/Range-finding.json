    "The battle rent a cobweb diamond-strung",
    "And cut a flower beside a ground bird's nest",
    "Before it stained a single human breast.",
    "The stricken flower bent double and so hung.",
    "And still the bird revisited her young.",
    "A butterfly its fall had dispossessed",
    "A moment sought in air his flower of rest,",
    "Then lightly stooped to it and fluttering clung.",
    "On the bare upland pasture there had spread",
    "O'ernight 'twixt mullein stalks a wheel of thread",
    "And straining cables wet with silver dew.",
    "A sudden passing bullet shook it dry.",
    "The indwelling spider ran to greet the fly,",
    "But finding nothing, sullenly withdrew."
