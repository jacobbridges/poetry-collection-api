    "A spear of zinc light wounds stone and water,",
    "stripping the scarlet fuchsia bells and yellow buttercups",
    "of any discretion, so they confess their end in this",
    "luminous declaration that they are no more than",
    "shortlived absolutes in living colour, bright eyes",
    "open against the dark. A light in which everything",
    "is exact-edged, flat, no bulk or heft to it, yet",
    "decisively itself in outline: islands, the matte grey sea,",
    "and miles away the fine glowing line of the horizon",
    "that like desire will be the last to go. The mountain's",
    "immense green and brown triangle reflects on itself",
    "in lakewater, doubling its shape and colour there,",
    "its stillness something drastic, an aspect of dread\u2014as if",
    "a lover tried to remember that loved other body",
    "by looking in the mirror. Almost at random, shadows",
    "fall across the small roads\u2014which can never follow",
    "their own bent, but always take the grain of the hill,",
    "turning to its every tilt and inclination\u2014and evening",
    "starts to seep into hedges and hung washing: it is",
    "the brown colour of a bat's wing, and silent",
    "as a bat is. Even your own family now would have to",
    "be streaked with it, their faces by degrees bleeding away",
    "in the gather-dark, whole patches of them blackening",
    "like zones of a map thrown on smouldering embers."
