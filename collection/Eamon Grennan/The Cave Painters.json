    "Holding only a handful of rushlight",
    "they pressed deeper into the dark, at a crouch",
    "until the great rock chamber",
    "flowered around them and they stood",
    "in an enormous womb of",
    "flickering light and darklight, a place",
    "to make a start. Raised hands cast flapping shadows",
    "over the sleeker shapes of radiance.",
    "They've left the world of weather and panic",
    "behind them and gone on in, drawing the dark",
    "in their wake, pushing as one pulse",
    "to the core of stone. The pigments mixed in big shells",
    "are crushed ore, petals and pollens, berries",
    "and the binding juices oozed",
    "out of chosen barks. The beasts",
    "begin to take shape from hands and feather-tufts",
    "(soaked in ochre, manganese, madder, mallow white)",
    "stroking the live rock, letting slopes and contours",
    "mould those forms from chance, coaxing",
    "rigid dips and folds and bulges",
    "to lend themselves to necks, bellies, swelling haunches,",
    "a forehead or a twist of horn, tails and manes",
    "curling to a crazy gallop.",
    "Intent and human, they attach",
    "the mineral, vegetable, animal",
    "realms to themselves, inscribing",
    "the one unbroken line",
    "everything depends on, from that",
    "impenetrable centre",
    "to the outer intangibles of light and air, even",
    "the speed of the horse, the bison's fear, the arc",
    "of gentleness that this big-bellied cow",
    "arches over its spindling calf, or the lancing",
    "dance of death that",
    "bristles out of the buck's",
    "struck flank. On this one line they leave",
    "a beak-headed human figure of sticks",
    "and one small, chalky, human hand.",
    "We'll never know if they worked in silence",
    "like people praying\u2014the way our monks",
    "illuminated their own dark ages",
    "in cross-hatched rocky cloisters,",
    "where they contrived a binding",
    "labyrinth of lit affinities",
    "to spell out in nature's lace and fable",
    "their mindful, blinding sixth sense",
    "of a god of shadows\u2014or whether (like birds",
    "tracing their great bloodlines over the globe)",
    "they kept a constant gossip up",
    "of praise, encouragement, complaint.",
    "It doesn't matter: we know",
    "they went with guttering rushlight",
    "into the dark; came to terms",
    "with the given world; must have had",
    "\u2014as their hands moved steadily",
    "by spiderlight\u2014one desire",
    "we'd recognise: they would\u2014before going on",
    "beyond this border zone, this nowhere",
    "that is now here\u2014leave something",
    "upright and bright behind them in the dark."
