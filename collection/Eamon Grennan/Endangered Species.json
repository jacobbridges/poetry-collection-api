    "Out the living-room window",
    "I see the two older children burning",
    "household trash under the ash tree",
    "in wind and rain. They move",
    "in slow motion about the flames,",
    "heads bowed in concentration",
    "as they feed each fresh piece in, hair",
    "blown wild across their faces, the fire",
    "wavering in tongues before them",
    "so they seem creatures",
    "half flame, half flesh,",
    "wholly separate from me. All of a sudden",
    "the baby breaks slowly down",
    "through the flexed branches of the ash",
    "in a blaze of blood and green leaves,",
    "an amniotic drench, a gleaming liver-purple",
    "slop of ripe placenta, head first",
    "and wailing to be amongst us. Boy and girl",
    "look up in silence and hold gravely out",
    "flamefeathered arms to catch her,",
    "who lands on her back in their linked",
    "and ashen hands. Later,",
    "when I take her in my arms",
    "for a walk to that turn on the high road",
    "where the sea always startles, I can see",
    "how at intervals she's thunderstruck",
    "by a scalloped green leaf, a shivering",
    "jig of grassheads, or that speckled bee",
    "that pushes itself among",
    "the purple and scarlet parts",
    "of a fuchsia bell. And her eyes are on fire."
