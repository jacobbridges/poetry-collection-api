    "A mountain of white ice",

    "and flowing swiftly",
    "from the north;",
    "grampuses and whales",
    "going by in companies,",
    "spouting up water in streams",
    "(these wonders of the Lord, I, Francis Higginson,",
    "saw on the way to Salem);",
    "a fair morning,",
    "and still many leagues from land,",
    "but the air warm and spiced\u2014",
    "yellow flowers on the sea,",
    "sometimes singly,",
    "sometimes in sheets;",
    "high trees on every hill and in every dale,",
    "on every island,",
    "and even on the stony cliffs;",
    "banks of earth",
    "on which are groves of trees,",
    "and no undergrowth of bush or brambles;",
    "the sandy shore overrun with vines",
    "of melons and of grapes",
    "which the beat and surging of the sea",
    "overflows",
    "(this I, Arthur Barlowe, saw);",
    "trees of sweet-smelling wood",
    "with rind and leaves sweet-smelling",
    "as the bark of cinnamon and leaves of bay;",
    "soil dark and soft,",
    "strawberries everywhere,",
    "hickory nuts and sassafras;",
    "here are grapes white and red,",
    "very sweet and strong,",
    "and plums, black and red,",
    "and single roses, white and red and damask;",
    "we have eaten venison with the Indians,",
    "and drunk water with spice in it\u2014",
    "Indian corn, even the coarsest,",
    "makes as pleasant a meat as rice.",
    "(Without any show of anger",
    "the Iroquois crunched our fingers in their mouths,",
    "and with their teeth tore off the nails;",
    "then hacked our fingers off, joint by joint,",
    "with stone hatchets, or with a shell too dull",
    "to cut the sinews;",
    "and in the stumps of our thumbs drove up spikes",
    "until the elbow;",
    "but so great the help of Jesus,",
    "with this maimed hand I, Isaac Jogues,",
    "Jesuit and priest,",
    "baptised an Indian among the captives,",
    "using the raindrops on a long leaf of corn.)",
    "Let others cry, \u201cNew lands!",
    "where Indians shall bring",
    "kernels of gold, wagons full of gold;",
    "whatever spills upon the way",
    "we shall tread carelessly,",
    "for we shall have so much of gold\u2014",
    "so many pearls to sew upon our clothes;",
    "away,",
    "unthrifty gentlemen,",
    "to the forests of Virginia!",
    "There are lands",
    "to feed all the poor of England,",

    "and away then to America,",
    "all you poor!\u201d",
    "In England a watch is set about us",
    "and we are clapt in jails,",
    "and Holland is a dear place,",
    "for there they live by trading\u2014",
    "but we are a plain country people",
    "whose trade is husbandry,",
    "and we would worship God as simply as the shepherds",
    "and Galilean fishermen,",
    "live as plainly;",
    "away,",
    "dissenters,",
    "to New England!",
    "A great wind is blowing,",
    "heavy rain\u2014",
    "thick darkness;",
    "the sailors running here and there,",
    "shouting at one another",
    "to pull at this and at that rope,",

    "landing in the rain\u2014",
    "the cold rain",
    "falling steadily;",
    "the ground wet,",
    "all the leaves dripping,",
    "and the rocks running with water;",

    "the cold air",
    "wind and blast;",

    "leaves new lands,",
    "new groves and habitations",
    "beside the glittering currents flowing quickly",
    "into the silver waters of the sun.",
    "Here are men who find",
    "a comfortable bed",
    "among the rocks,",
    "who wrap themselves",
    "in their coats",
    "to sleep upon the ground",
    "while their horse feeds in the grass beside the lake;",
    "who catch trout in the brook",
    "and roast them on the ashes;",
    "eat the flesh",
    "of bear for meat, the white meat of turkeys",
    "for their bread, and whose salt is brought",
    "in an iron pot across the mountains;",
    "who live",
    "where two hundred acres may be had",
    "for a calf and a wool hat;",
    "or walk where there is no road",
    "nor any man, except the savage.",
    "All the bells of Boston",
    "are tolling",
    "a solemn peal;",
    "the market men will take no more paper money\u2014",
    "hard money only;",
    "soldiers with bare feet showing through their shoes",
    "in the snow, the smoke of the camp-fires blowing into their",
    "eyes;",
    "for food a bowl of beef soup full of burnt leaves;",
    "no house or hut, and even the sick in tents.",
    "The rays of your light,",
    "like the sun\u2019s, Republic of France,",
    "shone first in the west; the eater shall give meat,",
    "and out of the strong sweetness\u2014",
    "out of the bones of the French monarchy",
    "the honey of freedom;",
    "the bells of Philadelphia are ringing",
    "as if for a fire,",
    "and the crowds,",
    "shouting and hallooing,",
    "fill the streets;",
    "ring, bells, throughout the night,",
    "let no one sleep;",
    "ring, clash, and peal",
    "until the log cabins and cottages of cedar shingles,",
    "the houses of grey stone or of brick,",
    "tremble,",
    "and the listeners",
    "feel in their flesh",
    "the vibrations of your metal voices",
    "ringing,",
    "Proclaim liberty,",
    "proclaim liberty throughout the land!",
    "Wrongs,",
    "like molecules of gas that seep into a house,",
    "explode",
    "in particles of fire!",
    "A captain gallops down the street,",
    "wheels,",
    "and the hoof of his horse",

    "his horse stops",
    "at what is",
    "flowing from the battlefield,",
    "sniffs at it, and will not cross;",
    "this is not water\u2014",

    "in a thick and ropy stream.",
    "(The dying Negress says,",
