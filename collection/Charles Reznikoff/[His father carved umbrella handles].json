    "The pay was small, though it had once been a good trade.",
    "They lived in the poorest part of the ghetto, near the lots",
    "where people dump ashes.",

    "If he were to give up this work he knew so well, to what else",
    "could he turn?",
    "He would just keep on. He had lost this world and knew there",
    "was no other."
