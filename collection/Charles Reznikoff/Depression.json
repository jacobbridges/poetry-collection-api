    "So proudly she came into the subway car",
    "all who were not reading their newspapers saw",
    "the head high and the slow tread\u2014",
    "coat wrinkled and her belongings in a paper bag,",
    "face unwashed and the grey hair uncombed;",
    "simple soul, who so early in the morning when only the",
    "poorest go to work,",
    "stood up in the subway and outshouting the noise:",
    "\u201cExcuse me, ladies and gentlemen, I have a baby at home who",
    "is sick,",
    "and I have no money, no job;\u201d who did not have box or cap",
    "to take coins\u2014",
    "only his hands,",
    "and, seeing only faces turned away,",
    "did not even go down the aisle as beggars do;",
    "the fire had burnt through the floor:",
    "machines and merchandise had fallen into",
    "the great hole, this zero that had sucked away so many years",
    "and now, seen at last, the shop itself;",
    "the ceiling sloped until it almost touched the floor\u2014",
    "a strange curve",
    "in the lines and oblongs of his life;",
    "drops were falling",
    "from the naked beams of the floor above,",
    "from the soaked plaster, still the ceiling;",
    "drops of dirty water were falling",
    "on his clothes and hat and on his hands;",
    "the thoughts of business",
    "gathered in his bosom like black water",
    "in footsteps through a swamp;",
    "waiting for a job, she studied the dusty table at which she sat",
    "and the floor which had been badly swept\u2014",
    "the office-boy had left the corners dirty;",
    "a mouse ran in and out under the radiator",
    "and she drew her feet away",
    "and her skirt about her legs, but the mouse went in and out",
    "about its business; and she sat waiting for a job",
    "in an unfriendly world of men and mice;",
    "walking along the drive by twos and threes,",
    "talking about jobs,",
    "jobs they might get and jobs they had had,",
    "never turning to look at the trees or the river",
    "glistening in the sunlight or the automobiles",
    "that went swiftly past them\u2014",
    "in twos and threes talking about jobs;",
    "in the drizzle",
    "four in a row",
    "close to the curb",
    "that passers-by might pass,",
    "the squads stand",
    "waiting for soup,",
    "a slice of bread",
    "and shelter\u2014",
    "grimy clothes",
    "their uniform;",
    "on a stoop",
    "stiffly across the steps",
    "a man",
    "who has fainted;",
    "each in that battalion",
    "eyes him,",
    "but does not move from his place,",
    "well drilled in want."
