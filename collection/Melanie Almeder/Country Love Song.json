    "I try to think of the cup of a hand,",
    "of legs in a tangle, and not the thistle",
    "though even it, purpled, spiking away,",
    "wants to be admired, wants to say, whistle",
    "a little for me. O every little thing wants",
    "to be loved, wants to be marked by the cry",
    "that brings desire to it, even blue-eyed fly",
    "to the bloated hiss of death. To love is to be remiss:",
    "the horse alone in the wide flat field nods",
    "its head as if the bridle and bit were missed",
    "or mocked; the cow slung with the unmilked weight",
    "of her tremendous teats shoots a look back over her shoulder",
    "at O lonesome me. I want to say to her need",
    "as if crooning could be enough,",
    "sweet, sweet mama . . . truth be told,",
    "the thousand lisping bees to the milkweeds' honey",
    "terrifies me. When the stink of slurry season",
    "is over and the greened fields are slathered, fecund,",
    "overtall foxgloves tip with the weight of their fruit.",
    "Then I dream a little dream of you",
    "and me, curled like two grubs on the top of a leaf",
    "wind-driven and scudding along the lake's surface.",
    "All night we glide to its blue harbor",
    "and back again. The fattened slack of us",
    "singing O darlin' darlin' darlin'."
