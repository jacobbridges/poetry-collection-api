    "I leave the formal garden of schedules",
    "where hours hedge me, clip the errant sprigs",
    "of thought, and day after day, a boxwood",
    "topiary hunt chases a green fox",
    "never caught. No voice calls me to order",
    "as I enter a dream of meadow, kneel",
    "to earth and, moving east to west, second",
    "the motion only of the sun. I plant",
    "frail seedlings in the unplowed field, trusting",
    "the wildness hidden in their hearts. Spring light",
    "sprawls across false indigo and hyssop,",
    "daisies, flax. Clouds form, dissolve, withhold",
    "or promise rain. In time, outside of time,",
    "the unkempt afternoons fill up with flowers."
