    "It\u2019s the mystery of the hunt that intrigues me,",
    "That drives us like lemmings, but cautiously\u2014",
    "The search for a bright square cloud\u2014the scent of lemon verbena\u2014",
    "Or to learn rules for the game the sea otters",
    "Play in the surf.",
    "It is these small things\u2014and the secret behind them",
    "That fill the heart.",
    "The pattern, the spirit, the fiery demon",
    "That link them together",
    "And pull their freedom into our senses,",
    "The smell of a shrub, a cloud, the action of animals",
    "\u2014The rising, the exuberance, when the mystery is unveiled.",
    "It is these small things",
    "That when brought into vision become an inferno.",
