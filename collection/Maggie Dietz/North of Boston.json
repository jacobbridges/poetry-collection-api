    "Hoarfrost coats and cuffs",
    "the playing fields, a heyday",
    "of glistening. So there\u2019s hope",
    "in my throat as I walk across them",
    "to the woods with my chest",
    "flung open, spilling its coins.",
    "The light so bright I can hear it,",
    "a silver tone like a penny whistle.",
    "It\u2019s fall, so I\u2019m craving pine cones.",
    "Hundreds of maples the color",
    "of bulldozers!",
    "But something strange",
    "is going on: the trees are tired",
    "of meaning, sick of providing",
    "mystery, parallels, consolation.",
    "\u201cLeave us alone,\u201d they seem to cry,",
    "with barely energy for a pun.",
    "The muscular river crawls on",
    "its belly in a maple coat of mail.",
    "Muddy and unreflective, it smells",
    "as if it too could use some privacy.",
    "The sumac reddens like a face,",
    "holding out its velvet pods",
    "almost desperately. The Queen",
    "Anne\u2019s Lace clicks in the wind.",
    "A deaf-mute milkweed",
    "foaming at the mouth.",
    "Back at the field I look",
    "for what I didn\u2019t mean",
    "to drop. The grass is green.",
    "Okay, Day,",
    "my host, I want to get out",
    "of your house. Come on, Night,",
    "with your twinkly stars and big",
    "dumb moon. Tell me don\u2019t",
    "show me, and wipe that grin",
    "off your face."
