    "The number of corners in the soul can't",
    "compare with the universe's dimensions folded",
    "neatly into swans. In the soul's",
    "space, one word on a thousand pieces",
    "of paper the size of cookie fortunes falls",
    "from the heavens. At last, the oracular",
    "answer, you cry, pawing at the scraps that twirl",
    "like seed-pod helicopters. Alas, the window",
    "to your soul needs a good scrubbing, so",
    "the letters doodle into indecipherables just",
    "like every answer that has rained",
    "down through history, and you realize, in",
    "your little smog of thought that death",
    "will simply be the cessation of asking, a thousand",
    "cranes unfolding themselves and returning to the trees."
