    "There are times when all the chutzpa I",
    "can muster isn't enough, fug and bluster",
    "all I can do, and damned if it doesn't",
    "just stand there, legs straddling",
    "a berm of washboard dust-ruts",
    "and in late noon sun stare me",
    "blue in the face: lord, we could almost",
    "trade places, my back strained",
    "by the weight of those great bone wings,",
    "my tongue itching for lily root.",
    "And musk, lord, the pheromones,",
    "a day so sweet with elderberry's too rank",
    "fume I could die twice over snuffing.",
    "While the truck mumbles and a trout spanks",
    "the cooler, I almost outdo myself.",
    "But reason, that too-convenient shortcut,",
    "creeps back, if only so far: the rest as we say",
    "is silence, dust and the sputter of flies",
    "and when lumbering to go it pauses",
    "and throws me its last worst look",
    "its sorrow is Christ's, dewlap",
    "jeweled, a beatitude of moss."
