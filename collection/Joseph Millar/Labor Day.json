    "Even the bosses are sleeping late",
    "in the dusty light of September.",
    "The parking lot\u2019s empty and no one cares.",
    "No one unloads a ladder, steps on the gas",
    "or starts up the big machines in the shop,",
    "sanding and grinding, cutting and binding.",
    "No one lays a flat bead of flux over a metal seam",
    "or lowers the steel forks from a tailgate.",
    "Shadows gather inside the sleeve",
    "of the empty thermos beside the sink,",
    "the bells go still by the channel buoy,",
    "the wind lies down in the west,",
    "the tuna boats rest on their tie-up lines",
    "turning a little, this way and that."
