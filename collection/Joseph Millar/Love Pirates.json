  "text": [
    "I follow with my mouth the small wing of muscle",
    "under your shoulder, lean over your back, breathing",
    "into your hair and thinking of nothing. I want",
    "to lie down with you under the sails of a wooden sloop",
    "and drift away from all of it, our two cars rusting",
    "in the parking lot, our families whining like tame geese",
    "at feeding time, and all the bosses of the earth",
    "cursing the traffic in the morning haze.",
    "They will telephone each other from their sofas",
    "and glass desks, with no idea where we could be,",
    "unable to picture the dark throat",
    "of the saxophone playing upriver, or the fire",
    "we gather between us on this fantail of dusty light,",
    "having stolen a truckload of roses",
    "and thrown them into the sea."
