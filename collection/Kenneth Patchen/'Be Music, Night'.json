    "Be music, night,",
    "That her sleep may go",
    "Where angels have their pale tall choirs",
    "Be a hand, sea,",
    "That her dreams may watch",
    "Thy guidesman touching the green flesh of the world",
    "Be a voice, sky,",
    "That her beauties may be counted",
    "And the stars will tilt their quiet faces",
    "Into the mirror of her loveliness",
    "Be a road, earth,",
    "That her walking may take thee",
    "Where the towns of heaven lift their breathing spires",
    "O be a world and a throne, God,",
    "That her living may find its weather",
    "And the souls of ancient bells in a child's book",
    "Shall lead her into Thy wondrous house"
