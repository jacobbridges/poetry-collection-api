    "In the shape of this night, in the still fall",
    "of snow, Father",
    "In all that is cold and tiny, these little birds",
    "and children",
    "In everything that moves tonight, the trolleys",
    "and the lovers, Father",
    "In the great hush of country, in the ugly noise",
    "of our cities",
    "In this deep throw of stars, in those trenches",
    "where the dead are, Father",
    "In all the wide land waiting, and in the liners",
    "out on the black water",
    "In all that has been said bravely, in all that is",
    "mean anywhere in the world, Father",
    "In all that is good and lovely, in every house",
    "where sham and hatred are",
    "In the name of those who wait, in the sound",
    "of angry voices, Father",
    "Before the bells ring, before this little point in time",
    "has rushed us on",
    "Before this clean moment has gone, before this night",
    "turns to face tomorrow, Father",
    "There is this high singing in the air",
    "Forever this sorrowful human face in eternity\u2019s window",
    "And there are other bells that we would ring, Father",
    "Other bells that we would ring."
