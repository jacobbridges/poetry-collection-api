    "As a boy he had trouble speaking,",
    "past three before a real word preened",
    "from his lips. And for the longest time,",
    "malaprops haunted him. His older sister",
    "did what she could to train the bitten seal",
    "of his brain to twirl the red ball",
    "on the nose of eloquence, and his grandmother",
    "tired of insisting he utter the names",
    "of toys or foods \u2014 for every desire",
    "was coded \u2014 and gave him whatever",
    "he grunted and pointed to.",
    "O, the man then a boy",
    "thought, when I tower among them",
    "I should invent my own speech",
    "and leave others empty and afraid",
    "that they did not know it, could not ask",
    "or plead their case in the one tongue",
    "that mattered. I shall have them",
    "look upon the simplest things,",
    "the man then a boy thought,",
    "and fill up with stolen awe,",
    "and point with their faces,",
    "their pupils wide as blackened coins,",
    "and hope with all the revenue",
    "shattered heart-glass can muster",
    "that someone had grasped",
    "their need as need and not",
    "as the monstrous coupling",
    "of sounds in a trance of whims.",
    "Then, the grind of his teeth",
    "vowed, then the plazas of my city",
    "will fill with my name,",
    "and their blood will matter",
    "as little to them as to me."
