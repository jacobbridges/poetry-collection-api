    "Lichen glows in the moonlight",
    "so fierce only cloud blocking",
    "the moon brings relief. Then passed by,",
    "recharged it leaps up off rocks",
    "and suffocates\u2014there is no route",
    "through rocks without having to confront",
    "its beseeching\u2014",
    "lights the way,",
    "not the moon, and outdoes epithets",
    "like phosphorescent, fluorescent, or florescent:",
    "it smirks and smiles and lifts the corner",
    "of its lips in hideous or blissful collusion,",
    "and birds pipe an eternal dawn, never knowing",
    "when to sleep or wake. They might",
    "be tricked into thinking their time\u2019s up,",
    "in the spectrum of lichen, its extra-gravital",
    "persuasion, its crackling movement",
    "remembered as still, indifferent, barely",
    "living under the sun, or on a dark night;",
    "climbing up you\u2019d escape, but like all great",
    "molecular weights it leaves traces",
    "you carry with you into the realms",
    "of comfort and faith."
