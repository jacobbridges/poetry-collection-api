    "Overhead, the match burns out,",
    "but the chunk of ice in the back seat",
    "keeps melting from imagined heat,",
    "while the old Hudson tiptoes up the slope.",
    "My voile blouse, so wet it is transparent,",
    "like one frightened hand, clutches my chest.",
    "The bag of rock salt sprawled beside me wakes, thirsty",
    "and stretches a shaky tongue toward the ice.",
    "I press the gas pedal hard.",
    "I\u2019ll get back to the house, the dirt yard, the cesspool,",
    "to you out back, digging a well",
    "you could fill with your sweat,",
    "though there is not one reason I should want to.",
    "You never notice me until the end of the day,",
    "when your hand is on my knee",
    "and the ice cream, cooked to broth,",
    "is hot enough to burn the skin off my touch."
