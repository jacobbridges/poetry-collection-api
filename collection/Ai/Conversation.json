    "We smile at each other",
    "and I lean back against the wicker couch.",
    "How does it feel to be dead? I say.",
    "You touch my knees with your blue fingers.",
    "And when you open your mouth,",
    "a ball of yellow light falls to the floor",
    "and burns a hole through it.",
    "Don\u2019t tell me, I say. I don't want to hear.",
    "Did you ever, you start,",
    "wear a certain kind of silk dress",
    "and just by accident,",
    "so inconsequential you barely notice it,",
    "your fingers graze that dress",
    "and you hear the sound of a knife cutting paper,",
    "you see it too",
    "and you realize how that image",
    "is simply the extension of another image,",
    "that your own life",
    "is a chain of words",
    "that one day will snap.",
    "Words, you say, young girls in a circle, holding hands,",
    "and beginning to rise heavenward",
    "in their confirmation dresses,",
    "like white helium balloons,",
    "the wreaths of flowers on their heads spinning,",
    "and above all that,",
    "that\u2019s where I\u2019m floating,",
    "and that\u2019s what it\u2019s like",
    "only ten times clearer,",
    "ten times more horrible.",
    "Could anyone alive survive it?"
