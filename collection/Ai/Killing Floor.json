    "1.",
    "On the day the sienna-skinned man",
    "held my shoulders between his spade-shaped hands,",
    "easing me down into the azure water of Jordan,",
    "I woke ninety-three million miles from myself,",
    "Lev Davidovich Bronstein,",
    "shoulder-deep in the Volga,",
    "while the cheap dye of my black silk shirt darkened the water.",
    "My head wet, water caught in my lashes.",
    "Am I blind?",
    "I rub my eyes, then wade back to shore,",
    "undress and lie down,",
    "until Stalin comes from his place beneath the birch tree.",
    "He folds my clothes",
    "and I button myself in my marmot coat,",
    "and together we start the long walk back to Moscow.",
    "He doesn\u2019t ask,",
    ",",
    "but I hear the hosts of a man drowning in water and holiness,",
    "the castrati voices I can\u2019t recognize,",
    "skating on knives, from trees, from air",
    "on the thin ice of my last night in Russia.",
    "Leon Trotsky. Bread.",
    "I want to scream, but silence holds my tongue",
    "with small spade-shaped hands",
    "and only this comes, so quietly",
    "Stalin has to press his ear to my mouth:",
    "I won\u2019t look back.",
    "2.",
    "At noon today, I woke from a nightmare:",
    "my friend Jacques ran toward me with an ax,",
    "as I stepped from the train in Alma-Ata.",
    "He was dressed in yellow satin pants and shirt.",
    "A marigold in winter.",
    "When I held out my arms to embrace him,",
    "he raised the ax and struck me at the neck,",
    "my head fell to one side, hanging only by skin.",
    "A river of sighs poured from the cut.",
    "3.",
    "The machine-gun bullets",
    "hit my wife in the legs,",
    "then zigzagged up her body.",
    "I took the shears, cut open her gown",
    "and lay on top of her for hours.",
    "Blood soaked through my clothes",
    "and when I tried to rise, I couldn\u2019t.",
    "I wake then. Another nightmare.",
    "I rise from my desk, walk to the bedroom",
    "and sit down at my wife\u2019s mirrored vanity.",
    "I rouge my cheeks and lips,",
    "stare at my bone-white, speckled egg of a face:",
    "lined and empty.",
    "I lean forward and see Jacques\u2019s reflection.",
    "I half-turn, smile, then turn back to the mirror.",
    "He moves from the doorway,",
    "lifts the pickax",
    "and strikes the top of my head.",
    "My brain splits.",
    "The pickax keeps going",
    "and when it hits the tile floor,",
    "it flies from his hands,",
    "a black dove on whose back I ride,",
    "two men, one cursing,",
    "the other blessing all things:",
    "I step from Jordan without you."
