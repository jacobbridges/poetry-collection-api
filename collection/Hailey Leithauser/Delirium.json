    "this apple-, pea- and celadon,",

    "an eremitic nun unfold;",
    "such breathy, breathy moth",
    "and wasp, such gleeful,",
    "greedy bee to bid",
    "the bully hearts of cops",
    "and bosses sob,",
    "to tell a stubby root unstub, a rusted",
    "hinge unrust, the slug unsalt;",
    "to stir the fusted",
    "lungs to brim, the skin to sting,",
    "the dormant,",
    "tinning tongue to singe and hymn."
