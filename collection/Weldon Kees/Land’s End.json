    "A day all blue and white, and we",
    "Came out of woods to sand",
    "And snow-capped waves. The sea",
    "Rose with us as we walked, the land",
    "Built dunes, a lighthouse, and a sky of gulls.",
    "Here where I built my life ten years ago,",
    "The day breaks gray and cold;",
    "And brown surf, muddying the shore,",
    "Deposits fish-heads, sewage, rusted tin.",
    "Children and men break bottles on the stones.",
    "Beyond the lighthouse, black against the sky,",
    "Two gulls are circling where the woods begin."
