    "Looking into my daughter\u2019s eyes I read",
    "Beneath the innocence of morning flesh",
    "Concealed, hintings of death she does not heed.",
    "Coldest of winds have blown this hair, and mesh",
    "Of seaweed snarled these miniatures of hands;",
    "The night\u2019s slow poison, tolerant and bland,",
    "Has moved her blood. Parched years that I have seen",
    "That may be hers appear: foul, lingering",
    "Death in certain war, the slim legs green.",
    "Or, fed on hate, she relishes the sting",
    "Of others\u2019 agony; perhaps the cruel",
    "Bride of a syphilitic or a fool.",
    "These speculations sour in the sun.",
    "I have no daughter. I desire none."
