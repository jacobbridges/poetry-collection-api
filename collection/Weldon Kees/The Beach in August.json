    "The day the fat woman",
    "In the bright blue bathing suit",
    "Walked into the water and died,",
    "I thought about the human",
    "Condition. Pieces of old fruit",
    "Came in and were left by the tide.",
    "What I thought about the human",
    "Condition was this: old fruit",
    "Comes in and is left, and dries",
    "In the sun. Another fat woman",
    "In a dull green bathing suit",
    "Dives into the water and dies.",
    "The pulmotors glisten. It is noon.",
    "We dry and die in the sun",
    "While the seascape arranges old fruit,",
    "Coming in and the tide, glistening",
    "At noon. A woman, moderately stout,",
    "In a nondescript bathing suit,",
    "Swims to a pier. A tall woman",
    "Steps toward the sea. One thinks about the human",
    "Condition. The tide goes in and goes out."
