    "I",
    "Tomorrow I will start to be happy.",
    "The morning will light up like a celebratory cigar.",
    "Sunbeams sprawling on the lawn will set",
    "dew sparkling like a cut-glass tumbler of champagne.",
    "Today will end the worst phase of my life.",
    "I will put my shapeless days behind me,",
    "fencing off the past, as a golden rind",
    "of sand parts slipshod sea from solid land.",
    "It is tomorrow I want to look back on, not today.",
    "Tomorrow I start to be happy; today is almost yesterday.",
    "II",
    "Australia, how wise you are to get the day",
    "over and done with first, out of the way.",
    "You have eaten the fruit of knowledge, while",
    "we are dithering about which main course to choose.",
    "How liberated you must feel, how free from doubt:",
    "the rise and fall of stocks, today\u2019s closing prices",
    "are revealed to you before our bidding has begun.",
    "Australia, you can gather in your accident statistics",
    "like a harvest while our roads still have hours to kill.",
    "When we are in the dark, you have sagely seen the light.",
    "III",
    "Cagily, presumptuously, I dare to write 2018.",
    "A date without character or tone. 2018.",
    "A year without interest rates or mean daily temperature.",
    "Its hit songs have yet to be written, its new-year",
    "babies yet to be induced, its truces to be signed.",
    "Much too far off for prophecy, though one hazards",
    "a tentative guess\u2014a so-so year most likely,",
    "vague in retrospect, fizzling out with the usual",
    "end-of-season sales; everything slashed:",
    "your last chance to salvage something of its style."
