    "I\u2019ve often wondered why she laughed",
    "On thinking why I wondered so;",
    "It seemed such waste that long white hands",
    "Should touch my hands and let them go.",
    "And once when we were parting there,",
    "Unseen of anything but trees,",
    "I touched her fingers, thoughtfully,",
    "For more than simple niceties.",
    "But for some futile things unsaid",
    "I should say all is done for us;",
    "Yet I have wondered how she smiled",
    "Beholding what was cavernous."
