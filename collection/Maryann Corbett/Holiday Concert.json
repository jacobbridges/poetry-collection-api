    "Forgive us. We have dragged them into the night",
    "in taffeta dresses, in stiff collars and ties,",
    "with the wind damp, the sleet raking their cheeks,",
    "to school lunchrooms fitted with makeshift stages",
    "where we will sit under bad fluorescent lighting",
    "on folding chairs, and they will sing and play.",
    "We will watch the first grader with little cymbals,",
    "bending her knees, hunched in concentration",
    "while neighbors snicker at her ardent face.",
    "Forgive us. We will hear the seventh-grade boy",
    "as his voice finally loses its innocence",
    "forever, at the unbearable solo moment",
    "and know that now, for years, he will wince at the thought",
    "of singing, yet will ache to sing, in silence,",
    "silence even to the generation to come",
    "with its night, its sleet, its hideous lunchroom chairs."
