    "Human reason is beautiful and invincible.",
    "No bars, no barbed wire, no pulping of books,",
    "No sentence of banishment can prevail against it.",
    "It establishes the universal ideas in language,",
    "And guides our hand so we write Truth and Justice",
    "With capital letters, lie and oppression with small.",
    "It puts what should be above things as they are,",
    "Is an enemy of despair and a friend of hope.",
    "It does not know Jew from Greek or slave from master,",
    "Giving us the estate of the world to manage.",
    "It saves austere and transparent phrases",
    "From the filthy discord of tortured words.",
    "It says that everything is new under the sun,",
    "Opens the congealed fist of the past.",
    "Beautiful and very young are Philo-Sophia",
    "And poetry, her ally in the service of the good.",
    "As late as yesterday Nature celebrated their birth,",
    "The news was brought to the mountains by a unicorn and an echo.",
    "Their friendship will be glorious, their time has no limit.",
    "Their enemies have delivered themselves to destruction."
