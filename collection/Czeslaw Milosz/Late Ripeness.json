    "Not soon, as late as the approach of my ninetieth year,",
    "I felt a door opening in me and I entered",
    "the clarity of early morning.",
    "One after another my former lives were departing,",
    "like ships, together with their sorrow.",
    "And the countries, cities, gardens, the bays of seas",
    "assigned to my brush came closer,",
    "ready now to be described better than they were before.",
    "I was not separated from people,",
    "grief and pity joined us.",
    "We forget\u2014I kept saying\u2014that we are all children of the King.",
    "For where we come from there is no division",
    "into Yes and No, into is, was, and will be.",
    "We were miserable, we used no more than a hundredth part",
    "of the gift we received for our long journey.",
    "Moments from yesterday and from centuries ago\u2014",
    "a sword blow, the painting of eyelashes before a mirror",
    "of polished metal, a lethal musket shot, a caravel",
    "staving its hull against a reef\u2014they dwell in us,",
    "waiting for a fulfillment.",
    "I knew, always, that I would be a worker in the vineyard,",
    "as are all men and women living at the same time,",
    "whether they are aware of it or not."
