    "Come, Holy Spirit,",
    "bending or not bending the grasses,",
    "appearing or not above our heads in a tongue of flame,",
    "at hay harvest or when they plough in the orchards or when snow",
    "covers crippled firs in the Sierra Nevada.",
    "I am only a man: I need visible signs.",
    "I tire easily, building the stairway of abstraction.",
    "Many a time I asked, you know it well, that the statue in church",
    "lifts its hand, only once, just once, for me.",
    "But I understand that signs must be human,",
    "therefore call one man, anywhere on earth,",
    "not me\u2014after all I have some decency\u2014",
    "and allow me, when I look at him, to marvel at you."
