    "You who wronged a simple man",
    "Bursting into laughter at the crime,",
    "And kept a pack of fools around you",
    "To mix good and evil, to blur the line,",
    "Though everyone bowed down before you,",
    "Saying virtue and wisdom lit your way,",
    "Striking gold medals in your honor,",
    "Glad to have survived another day,",
    "Do not feel safe. The poet remembers.",
    "You can kill one, but another is born.",
    "The words are written down, the deed, the date.",
    "And you\u2019d have done better with a winter dawn,",
    "A rope, and a branch bowed beneath your weight."
