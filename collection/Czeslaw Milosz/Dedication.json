    "You whom I could not save",
    "Listen to me.",
    "Try to understand this simple speech as I would be ashamed of another.",

    "What strengthened me, for you was lethal.",
    "You mixed up farewell to an epoch with the beginning of a new one,",
    "Inspiration of hatred with lyrical beauty;",
    "Blind force with accomplished shape.",
    "Here is a valley of shallow Polish rivers. And an immense bridge",
    "Going into white fog. Here is a broken city;",
    "And the wind throws the screams of gulls on your grave",
    "When I am talking with you.",
    "What is poetry which does not save",
    "Nations or people?",
    "A connivance with official lies,",
    "A song of drunkards whose throats will be cut in a moment,",
    "Readings for sophomore girls.",
    "That I wanted good poetry without knowing it,",
    "That I discovered, late, its salutary aim,",
    "In this and only this I find salvation.",
    "They used to pour millet on graves or poppy seeds",
    "To feed the dead who would come disguised as birds.",
    "I put this book here for you, who once lived",
    "So that you should visit us no more."
