    "The woman is perfected.",

    "Body wears the smile of accomplishment,",

    "Each dead child coiled, a white serpent,",
    "One at each little",
    "Pitcher of milk, now empty.",
    "She has folded",
    "Them back into her body as petals",
    "Of a rose close when the garden",
    "Stiffens and odors bleed",
    "From the sweet, deep throats of the night flower.",
    "The moon has nothing to be sad about,",
    "Staring from her hood of bone.",
    "She is used to this sort of thing.",
    "Her blacks crackle and drag."
