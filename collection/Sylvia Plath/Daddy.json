    "You do not do, you do not do",
    "Any more, black shoe",
    "In which I have lived like a foot",
    "For thirty years, poor and white,",
    "Barely daring to breathe or Achoo.",
    "Daddy, I have had to kill you.",
    "You died before I had time\u2014\u2014",
    "Marble-heavy, a bag full of God,",
    "Ghastly statue with one gray toe",
    "Big as a Frisco seal",
    "And a head in the freakish Atlantic",
    "Where it pours bean green over blue",
    "In the waters off beautiful Nauset.",
    "I used to pray to recover you.",
    "Ach, du.",
    "In the German tongue, in the Polish town",
    "Scraped flat by the roller",
    "Of wars, wars, wars.",
    "But the name of the town is common.",
    "My Polack friend",
    "Says there are a dozen or two.",
    "So I never could tell where you",
    "Put your foot, your root,",
    "I never could talk to you.",
    "The tongue stuck in my jaw.",
    "It stuck in a barb wire snare.",
    "Ich, ich, ich, ich,",
    "I could hardly speak.",
    "I thought every German was you.",
    "And the language obscene",
    "An engine, an engine",
    "Chuffing me off like a Jew.",
    "A Jew to Dachau, Auschwitz, Belsen.",
    "I began to talk like a Jew.",
    "I think I may well be a Jew.",
    "The snows of the Tyrol, the clear beer of Vienna",
    "Are not very pure or true.",
    "With my gipsy ancestress and my weird luck",
    "And my Taroc pack and my Taroc pack",
    "I may be a bit of a Jew.",
    "I have always been scared of",
    "With your Luftwaffe, your gobbledygoo.",
    "And your neat mustache",
    "And your Aryan eye, bright blue.",
    "Panzer-man, panzer-man, O You\u2014\u2014",
    "Not God but a swastika",
    "So black no sky could squeak through.",
    "Every woman adores a Fascist,",
    "The boot in the face, the brute",
    "Brute heart of a brute like you.",
    "You stand at the blackboard, daddy,",
    "In the picture I have of you,",
    "A cleft in your chin instead of your foot",
    "But no less a devil for that, no not",
    "Any less the black man who",
    "Bit my pretty red heart in two.",
    "I was ten when they buried you.",
    "At twenty I tried to die",
    "And get back, back, back to you.",
    "I thought even the bones would do.",
    "But they pulled me out of the sack,",
    "And they stuck me together with glue.",
    "And then I knew what to do.",
    "I made a model of you,",
    "A man in black with a Meinkampf look",
    "And a love of the rack and the screw.",
    "And I said I do, I do.",
    "So daddy, I\u2019m finally through.",
    "The black telephone\u2019s off at the root,",
    "The voices just can\u2019t worm through.",
    "If I\u2019ve killed one man, I\u2019ve killed two\u2014\u2014",
    "The vampire who said he was you",
    "And drank my blood for a year,",
    "Seven years, if you want to know.",
    "Daddy, you can lie back now.",
    "There\u2019s a stake in your fat black heart",
    "And the villagers never liked you.",
    "They are dancing and stamping on you.",
    "They always",
    "it was you.",
    "Daddy, daddy, you bastard, I\u2019m through."
