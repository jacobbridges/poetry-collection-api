    "in limousines of obsidian, the Virgin in a Madonna T-shirt,",
    "y los Indios with flutes made of thigh bones",
    "and bombs made of skulls; out come",
    "the dead dictators chained together by ectoplasm",
    "swinging censors that emit the stink of money,",
    "priests with rifles, nuns with giant beasts",
    "whose names are forgotten hidden in the musk",
    "of their habits; out come conquistadores on roller skates,",
    "Moros in black on black motorcycles, Mad Max",
    "with tattoos de los Maras Salvatruche.",
    "When los poetas have finished, there are more fireworks.",
    "They are swarmed by hijitos, viejos y otros",
    "wanting autographs. Their hands are as soft as their hearts.",
    "Death does not hide here but lives among them dressed in",
    "white lace with earrings rattling on her skull. Life does not hide",
    "here but steps through irony as if it were the vanishing fog."
