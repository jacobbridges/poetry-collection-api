    "Though I with strange desire",
    "To kiss those rosy lips am set on fire,",

    "From Lesbia them in thousands did receive.",
    "Heart mine, but once me kiss,",
    "And I by that sweet bliss",
    "Even swear to cease you to importune more;",
    "Poor one no number is;",
    "Another word of me ye shall not hear",
    "After one kiss, but still one kiss, my dear."
