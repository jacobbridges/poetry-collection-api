    "Right shoulder aching with day-long butchery,",
    "Left shoulder numb with dints clanged on the shield,",
    "The hero is fouled with blood, his own and others\u2019,",
    "First slick, then sticky, then caked, starting to mat",
    "His beard\u2014the armor deadweight all around him;",
    "His teeth grit and rattle with every jolt",
    "Of bronze-rimmed wheels behind the shit-flecked horses.",
    "But when he glimpses the mountains, the distant snow,",
    "A blankness swoons upon him, and he hears",
    "Nothing but the white vowels of the wind",
    "Brushing through stands of spears like conifers",
    "While a banner slips its staff and hangs in the blue",
    "Like a kestrel or a contrail. The hero\u2019s death,",
    "The prize, elusive quarry of his life,",
    "Stands stock-still in her cloven tracks in snow",
    "And turns, one ear tuned to the creek\u2019s far bank,",
    "One dished towards him. Her unstartled gaze",
    "Beads on him like a sniper\u2019s sights, until",
    "At the clean report of a cracking poplar branch,",
    "She leaps away like luck, over rapid water,",
    "And snowfall scrims the scene like a mist of tears,",
    "Like a migraine, like sweat or blood streaming into your eyes."
