    "The rain is haunted;",
    "I had forgotten.",
    "My children are two hours abed",
    "And yet I rise",
    "Hearing behind the typing of the rain,",
    "Its abacus and digits,",
    "A voice calling me again,",
    "Softer, clearer.",
    "The kids lie buried under duvets, sound",
    "Asleep. It isn\u2019t them I hear, it\u2019s",
    "Something formless that fidgets",
    "Beyond the window\u2019s benighted mirror,",
    "Where a negative develops, where reflection",
    "Holds up a glass of spirits.",
    "White noise",
    "Precipitates.",
    "Rain is a kind of recollection.",
    "Much has been shed,",
    "Hissing indignantly into the ground.",
    "It is the listening",
    "Belates,",
    "Haunted by these fingertaps and sighs",
    "Behind the beaded-curtain glistening,",
    "As though by choices that we didn\u2019t make and never wanted,",
    "As though by the dead and misbegotten."
