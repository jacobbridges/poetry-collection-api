    "Sleep, she will not linger:",
    "She turns her moon-cold shoulder.",
    "With no ring on her finger,",
    "You cannot hope to hold her.",

    "She tosses off the cover",
    "And lays the darkness bare.",
    "She has another lover.",
    "Her heart is otherwhere.",
    "She lays the darkness bare.",
    "You slowly realize",
    "Her heart is otherwhere.",
    "There's distance in her eyes.",
    "You slowly realize",
    "That she will never linger,",
    "With distance in her eyes",
    "And no ring on her finger."
