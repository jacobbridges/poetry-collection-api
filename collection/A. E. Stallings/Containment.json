    "So long I have been carrying myself",
    "Carefully, carefully, like a small child",
    "With too much water in a real glass",
    "Clasped in two hands, across a space as vast",
    "As living rooms, while gazes watch the waves",
    "That start to rile the little inland sea",
    "And slap against its cliffs' transparency,",
    "Revise and meet, double their amplitude,",
    "Harmonizing doubt from many ifs.",
    "Distant frowns like clouds begin to brood.",
    "Soon there is overbrimming. Soon the child",
    "Looks up to find a face to match the scolding,",
    "And just as he does, the vessel he was holding",
    "Is almost set down safely on the bookshelf."
