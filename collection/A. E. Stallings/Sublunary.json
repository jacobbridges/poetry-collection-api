    "Mid-sentence, we remembered the eclipse,",
    "Arguing home through our scant patch of park",
    "Still warm with barrel wine, when none too soon",
    "We checked the hour by glancing at the moon,",
    "Unphased at first by that old ruined marble",
    "Looming like a monument over the hill,",
    "So brimmed with light it seemed about to spill,",
    "Then, there! We watched the thin edge disappear\u2014",
    "The obvious stole over us like awe,",
    "That it was our own silhouette we saw,",
    "Slow perhaps to us moon-gazing here",
    "(Reaching for each other's fingertips)",
    "But sweeping like a wing across that stark",
    "Alien surface at the speed of dark.",
    "The crickets stirred from winter sleep to warble",
    "Something out of time, confused and brief,",
    "The roosting birds sang out in disbelief,",
    "The neighborhood's stray dogs began to bark.",
    "And then the moon was gone, and in its place,",
    "A dim red planet hung just out of reach,",
    "As real as a bitter orange or ripened peach",
    "In the penumbra of a tree. At last",
    "We rose and strolled at a reflective pace",
    "Past the taverna crammed with light and smoke",
    "And people drinking, laughing at a joke,",
    "Unaware that anything had passed",
    "Outside in the night where we delayed",
    "Sheltering in the shadow we had made."
