    "One was fire red,",
    "Hand carved and new\u2014",
    "The local maker pried the wood",
    "From a torn-down church's pew,",
    "The Devil's instrument",
    "Wrenched from the house of God.",
    "It answered merrily and clear",
    "Though my fingering was flawed;",
    "Bright and sharp as a young wine,",
    "They said, but it would mellow,",
    "And that I would grow into it.",
    "The other one was yellow",
    "And nicked down at the chin,",
    "A varnish of Baltic amber,",
    "A one-piece back of tiger maple",
    "And a low, dark timbre.",
    "A century old, they said,",
    "Its sound will never change.",
    "Rich and deep on G and D,",
    "Thin on the upper range,",
    "And how it came from the Old World",
    "Was anybody's guess\u2014",
    "Light as an exile's suitcase,",
    "A belly of emptiness:",
    "That was the one I chose",
    "(Not the one of flame)",
    "And teachers would turn in their practiced hands",
    "To see whence the sad notes came."
