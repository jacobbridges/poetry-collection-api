    "Featherweight lawn chair, cooler for a footrest,",
    "and me a squatter on the landlord's dock",
    "where baitstealers teased a thousand times a day",
    "until rowdy boats and summer scared them deep.",
    "Day and night I snoozed on the porch",
    "beneath a filthy orbit of fanblades",
    "to the opera of my neighbors fighting",
    "and reconciling in the glow of stolen wattage.",
    "I saw them swimming once. Maybe naked,",
    "judging from their skittish talk, but the water",
    "smeared their bodies' pale particulars.",
    "It was just me and the Tickfaw River.",
    "Me with the taste of a tin can in my mouth,",
    "feeling no pain, lighting a cigarette backwards,",
    "the Tickfaw tricking me closer and closer",
    "with echoes and music out of nowhere.",
    "Is it funny that I was too lit to notice",
    "twenty-five orange yards of extension cord",
    "stretching from my outlet, over the driveway shells,",
    "to feed the hungry plug of their deep freezer?",
    "Mother would have pitched a fit if she discovered",
    "the stash of whiskey in the woodpile,",
    "and my father wasn't laughing",
    "if he looked down from his company of stars."
