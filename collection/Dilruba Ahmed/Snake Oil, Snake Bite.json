    "They staunched the wound with a stone.",
    "They drew blue venom from his blood",
    "until there was none.",
    "When his veins ran true his face remained",
    "lifeless and all the mothers of the village",
    "wept and pounded their chests until the sky",
    "had little choice",
    "but to grant their supplications. God made",
    "the boy breathe again.",
    "God breathes life into us, it is said,",
    "only once. But this case was an exception.",
    "God drew back in a giant gust and blew life into the boy",
    "and like a stranded fish, he shuddered, oceanless.",
    "It was true: the boy lived.",
    "He lived for a very long time. The toxins",
    "were an oil slick: contaminated, cleaned.",
    "But just as soon as the women",
    "kissed redness back into his cheeks",
    "the boy began to die again.",
    "He continued to die for the rest of his life.",
    "The dying took place slowly, sweetly.",
    "The dying took a very long time."
