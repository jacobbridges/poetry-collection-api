    "My son's been learning time: big hand",
    "and little, powers of sixty",
    "and of twenty-four, the slow semaphore",
    "of days. He's brought home paper plates",
    "from kindergarten, arrows pointing",
    "at his favorite hours. So far",
    "the face of every clock has smiled.",
    "And before we read to sleep each night",
    "he crosses off another square",
    "on the calendar above his bed,",
    "counting down to Christmas or to nothing",
    "in particular, sometimes just a line",
    "he draws uphill or down, check marks",
    "like the ones his teacher leaves",
    "on sheets he's filled with capitals",
    "and lower cases, other times a pair",
    "of thick lines like the crossed bones",
    "on a pirate's flag, an X",
    "as if to mark the treasure buried",
    "in some ordinary week,",
    "no day yet a cross to bear."
