  "text": [
    "The dogs eat hoof slivers and lie under the porch.",
    "A strand of human hair hangs strangely from a fruit tree",
    "like a cry in the throat. The sky is clay for the child who is past",
    "being tired, who wanders in waist-deep",
    "grasses. Gnats rise in a vapor,",
    "in a long mounting whine around her forehead and ears.",
    "The sun is an indistinct moon. Frail sticks",
    "of grass poke her ankles,",
    "and a wet froth of spiders touches her legs",
    "like wet fingers. The musk and smell",
    "of air are as hot as the savory",
    "terrible exhales from a tired horse.",
    "The parents are sleeping all afternoon,",
    "and no one explains the long uneasy afternoons.",
    "She hears their combined breathing and swallowing",
    "salivas, and sees their sides rising and falling",
    "like the sides of horses in the hot pasture.",
    "At evening a breeze dries and crumbles",
    "the sky and the clouds float like undershirts",
    "and cotton dresses on a clothesline. Horses",
    "rock to their feet and race or graze.",
    "Parents open their shutters and call",
    "the lonely, happy child home.",
    "The child who hates silences talks and talks",
    "of cicadas and the manes of horses."
