    "After there were no women, men, and children,",
    "from the somber deeps horseshoe crabs crawled up on somber shores:",
    "Man-of-Wars' blue sails drifted downwind",
    "and blue filaments of some biblical cloak",
    "floated below: the stinging filaments.",
    "The cored of bone and rock-headed came near:",
    "clouds made wandering shadows:",
    "sea and grasses mingled::",
    "There was no hell after all",
    "but a lull before it began over::",
    "flesh lying alone: then mating: a little spray of soul:",
    "and the grace of waves, of stars, and remotest isles."
