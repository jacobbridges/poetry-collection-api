    "Into the changes of autumn brush",
    "the doe walked, and the hide, head, and ears",
    "were the tinsel browns. They made her.",
    "I could not see her. She reappeared, stuffed with apples,",
    "and I shot her. Into the pines she ran,",
    "and I ran after. I might have lost her,",
    "seeing no sign of blood or scuffle,",
    "but felt myself part of the woods,",
    "a woman with a doe\u2019s ears, and heard her",
    "dying, counted her last breaths like a song",
    "of dying, and found her dying.",
    "I shot her again because her lungs rattled like castanets,",
    "then poked her with the gun barrel",
    "because her eyes were dusty and unreal.",
    "I opened her belly and pushed the insides",
    "like rotted fruit into a rabbit hole,",
    "skinned her, broke her leg joints under my knee,",
    "took the meat, smelled the half-digested smell",
    "that was herself. Ah, I closed her eyes.",
    "I left her refolded in some briars",
    "with the last sun on her head",
    "like a benediction, head tilted on its axis",
    "of neck and barren bone; head bent",
    "wordless over a death, though I heard",
    "the night wind blowing through her fur,",
    "heard riot in the emptied head."
