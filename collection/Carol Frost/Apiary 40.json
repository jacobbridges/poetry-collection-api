    "The humble sense of being alive",
    "under the towering sun",
    "fills the nectary and ripens apricots",
    "down to the last one,",
    "if Mnemosyne wakens from apathy",
    "each moment. It is the soft burly sound",
    "of a bee tumbled in fritillary,",
    "is it not?",
    "But if memory, as if to illustrate",
    "the mind was not yours to have,",
    "the mind was not given,",
    "fails us, leaving us in our underpants",
    "in the garden, should we not",
    "hate the garden,",
    "or the woman whose garden",
    "it is? And sunlight. Thunder.",
    "Rain. Hardened in heart against",
    "what earth compels and seizes,",
    "goddamning, goddamned rain."
