    "I",
    "I\u2019ve felt undeserving. I\u2019ve made myself ill with the glory,",
    "in the unleavened garden",
    "disgorged the lies and scared away with a stick a snake.",
    "What made me cover that which I could not have?",
    "I\u2019ve grieved and walked in catacombs,",
    "I\u2019ve felt undeserving. I\u2019ve made myself ill with the glory.",
    "Even the falling leaves gesture their renunciation.",
    "I disgorge the lies and abhor the serpent\u2019s hiss.",
    "I remember seasons, things I bring from far away,",
    "and grieve. I walk in catacombs.",
    "In gardens now, by the stone walls, sunlight closes,",
    "the falling leaves gesture their renunciation.",
    "I remember being in a field touching a man\u2019s body.",
    "I remember seasons, things I bring from far away",
    "and things that hold their breath for shame.",
    "His skin was soft as a girl\u2019s and he closed his eyes.",
    "I placed apple petals on his eyelids;",
    "we were lying in a field and I touched his body.",
    "Then there were clouds, an uncanny silence,",
    "as when in a green place the air holds its breath for shame.",
    "What made me covet what I could not have?",
    "Ill with the power and glory, a thrashing in my chest,",
    "I remember the unleavened gardens,",
    "petals falling singly, the yellow snake disgorging lies.",
    "II",
    "I\u2019ve grieved and walked in catacombs.",
    "I\u2019ve felt undeserving. I\u2019ve made myself ill with the glory,",
    "power and glory--",
    "a thrashing in my rib cage.",
    "I\u2019ve gone into the unleavened spring garden,",
    "disgorged the lies,",
    "and scared away with a stick a snake.",
    "I\u2019ve grieved and walked in catacombs.",
    "What made me cover that which I could not have?",
    "I\u2019ve felt undeserving. In this bright land",
    "that changes from yellow to green and back to yellow,",
    "I remember seasons, things I bring with me from far away",
    "and things that hold their breath as if for shame.",
    "I\u2019ve made myself ill with the power and glory.",
    "I\u2019ve gone into the unleavened garden",
    "and startled a yellow snake",
    "disgorging lies. A thrashing in my rib cage.",
    "What made me cover what I could not have?",
    "I remember seasons. Things that hold their breath for shame.",
    "Things I bring with me from far away.",
    "III",
    "I\u2019ve made myself ill with the power and glory.",
    "I\u2019ve made myself ill with the power and glory."
