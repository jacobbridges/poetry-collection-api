    "The stems of the sun bent over the eye",

    "The whole of the earth",
    "And this head heavy with fear",
    "In the night",
    "This complete hole",
    "Vast",
    "And even so streaming with water",
    "The noise",
    "The peals of little bells mingled with the",
    "Clinking of glasses",
    "And bursts of laughter",
    "The head moves",
    "On the carpet the body shifts",
    "And turns over the warm spot",
    "At the slipping feet of the animal",
    "It\u2019s that they\u2019re waiting",
    "For the summons of the shock",
    "And the signal of the eyelid",
    "The ray relaxes",
    "Sleep",
    "Light",
    "And what is left shines at the edge of the white rock"
