    "Again with spring",
    "she wore light colours",
    "and with gentle steps",
    "again with spring",
    "again in summer",
    "she was smiling.",
    "Among fresh blossoms",
    "breast naked to the veins",
    "beyond the dry night",
    "beyond the white old men",
    "debating quietly",
    "whether it would be better",
    "to give up the keys",
    "or to pull the rope",
    "and hang from the noose",
    "to leave empty bodies",
    "there where souls couldn\u2019t endure",
    "there where the mind couldn\u2019t catch up",
    "and knees buckled.",
    "With the new blossoms",
    "the old men failed",
    "and gave up on everything",
    "grandchildren and great-grandchildren",
    "the broad fields",
    "the green mountains",
    "love and life",
    "compassion and shelter",
    "rivers and sea;",
    "and they departed like statues",
    "leaving behind a silence",
    "that no sword could cut",
    "that no gallop could break",
    "nor the voices of the young;",
    "and the great loneliness came",
    "the great privation",
    "along with this spring",
    "and settled and spread",
    "like the frost of dawn",
    "caught hold of the high branches",
    "slid down the trunks of trees",
    "and wrapped around our soul.",
    "But she smiled",
    "wearing light colours",
    "like a blossoming almond tree",
    "in yellow flames",
    "and walked along lightly",
    "opening windows",
    "in the delighted sky",
    "without us the luckless ones.",
    "And I saw her breast naked",
    "the waist and the knee,",
    "as the inviolate martyr",
    "inviolate and pure",
    "issues from the torment",
    "to go to heaven,",
    "beyond the inexplicable",
    "whispering of people",
    "in the boundless circus",
    "beyond the black grimace",
    "the sweaty neck",
    "of the exasperated executioner",
    "striking vainly.",
    "The loneliness now a lake",
    "the privation now a lake",
    "untouched and untraceable."
