    "There are birds here,",
    "so many birds here",
    "is what I was trying to say",
    "when they said those birds were metaphors",
    "for what is trapped",
    "between buildings",
    "and buildings. No.",
    "The birds are here",
    "to root around for bread",
    "the girl\u2019s hands tear",
    "and toss like confetti. No,",
    "I don\u2019t mean the bread is torn like cotton,",
    "I said confetti, and no",
    "not the confetti",
    "a tank can make of a building.",
    "I mean the confetti",
    "a boy can\u2019t stop smiling about",
    "and no his smile isn\u2019t much",
    "like a skeleton at all. And no",
    "his neighborhood is not like a war zone.",
    "I am trying to say",
    "his neighborhood",
    "is as tattered and feathered",
    "as anything else,",
    "as shadow pierced by sun",
    "and light parted",
    "by shadow-dance as anything else,",
    "but they won\u2019t stop saying",
    "how lovely the ruins,",
    "how ruined the lovely",
    "children must be in that birdless city."
