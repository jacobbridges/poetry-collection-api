    "Between the imaginary iceberg and the skeletal whale",
    "is the stuffed and mounted mermaid in her case,",
    "the crudely-stitched seam between skin and scale",
    "so unlike Herbert Draper\u2019s siren dreams, loose",
    "on the swelling tide, part virgin and part harpy.",
    "Her post-mortem hair and her terrible face",
    "look more like P.T. Barnum\u2019s Freak of Feejee,",
    "piscene and wordless, trapped in the net of a stare.",
    "She has the head and shrivelled tits of a monkey,",
    "the green glass eyes of a porcelain doll, a pair",
    "of praying-mantis hands, and fishy lips",
    "open to reveal her sea-caved mouth, her rare",
    "ivory mermaid-teeth. Children breathe and rap",
    "on the glass to make her move. In her fixity",
    "she\u2019s as far as can be from the selkie who slips",
    "her wet pelt on the beaches of Orkney",
    "and walks as a woman, pupils widened in light,",
    "discarding the stuffed sack of her body.",
    "Without hearing, or touch, or taste, or smell, or sight",
    "she echoes the numb roll of the whale",
    "in a sea congealed with cold, when it was thought",
    "no beast could be a nerveless as the whale."
