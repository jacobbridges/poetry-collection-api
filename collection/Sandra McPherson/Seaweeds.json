    "I know a little what it is like, once here at high tide",
    "Stranded, for them to be so attached to the bottom\u2019s",
    "Sarcophagus lids, up to their brown green gold wine",
    "Bottle necks in the prevailing booze, riding, as far",
    "As we can see, like a picnic on a blanket.",
    "Whatever plucks them from below the red horizon",
    "Like snapped pulleys and ropes for the pyramidal effort",
    "Of the moon, they come in, they come through the breakers,",
    "Heaps of hair, writing across the beach a collapsed",
    "Script, signers of a huge independence.",
    "Melville thought them pure, bitter, seeing the fog-sized",
    "Flies dancing stiff and renaissance above. But I",
    "Have eaten nori and dulse, and to have gone deep",
    "Before being cast out leaves hardly a taste of loneliness.",
    "And I take in their iodine."
