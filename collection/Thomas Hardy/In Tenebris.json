    "Wintertime nighs;",

    "It cannot bring again:",
    "Twice no one dies.",
    "Flower-petals flee;",
    "But, since it once hath been,",
    "No more that severing scene",
    "Can harrow me.",

    "I shall not lose old strength",
    "In the lone frost's black length:",
    "Strength long since fled!",
    "Leaves freeze to dun;",

    "This season as of old",
    "For him with none.",
    "Tempests may scath;",
    "But love can not make smart",
    "Again this year his heart",
    "Who no heart hath.",
    "Black is night's cope;",
    "But death will not appal",
    "One who, past doubtings all,",
    "Waits in unhope."
