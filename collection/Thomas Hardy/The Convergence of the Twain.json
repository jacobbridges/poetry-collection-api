    "I",
    "In a solitude of the sea",
    "Deep from human vanity,",
    "And the Pride of Life that planned her, stilly couches she.",
    "II",
    "Steel chambers, late the pyres",
    "Of her salamandrine fires,",
    "Cold currents thrid, and turn to rhythmic tidal lyres.",
    "III",
    "Over the mirrors meant",
    "To glass the opulent",
    "The sea-worm crawls \u2014 grotesque, slimed, dumb, indifferent.",
    "IV",
    "Jewels in joy designed",
    "To ravish the sensuous mind",
    "Lie lightless, all their sparkles bleared and black and blind.",
    "V",
    "Dim moon-eyed fishes near",
    "Gaze at the gilded gear",
    "And query: \"What does this vaingloriousness down here?\" ...",
    "VI",
    "Well: while was fashioning",
    "This creature of cleaving wing,",
    "The Immanent Will that stirs and urges everything",
    "VII",
    "Prepared a sinister mate",
    "For her \u2014 so gaily great \u2014",
    "A Shape of Ice, for the time far and dissociate.",
    "VIII",
    "And as the smart ship grew",
    "In stature, grace, and hue,",
    "In shadowy silent distance grew the Iceberg too.",
    "IX",
    "Alien they seemed to be;",
    "No mortal eye could see",
    "The intimate welding of their later history,",
    "X",
    "Or sign that they were bent",
    "By paths coincident",
    "On being anon twin halves of one august event,",
    "XI",
    "Till the Spinner of the Years",
    "Said \"Now!\" And each one hears,",
    "And consummation comes, and jars two hemispheres."
