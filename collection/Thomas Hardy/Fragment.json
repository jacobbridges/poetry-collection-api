    "At last I entered a long dark gallery,",
    "Catacomb-lined; and ranged at the side",
    "Were the bodies of men from far and wide",
    "Who, motion past, were nevertheless not dead.",
    "\"The sense of waiting here strikes strong;",
    "Everyone's waiting, waiting, it seems to me;",
    "What are you waiting for so long? \u0097",
    "What is to happen?\" I said.",
    "\"O we are waiting for one called God,\" said they,",
    "\"(Though by some the Will, or Force, or Laws;",
    "And, vaguely, by some, the Ultimate Cause;)",
    "Waiting for him to see us before we are clay.",

    "It is clear he must know some day.\"",
    "I thereon asked them why.",
    "\"Since he made us humble pioneers",
    "Of himself in consciousness of Life's tears,",
    "It needs no mighty prophecy",
    "To tell that what he could mindlessly show",
    "His creatures, he himself will know.",
    "\"By some still close-cowled mystery",
    "We have reached feeling faster than he,",
    "But he will overtake us anon,",
    "If the world goes on.\""
