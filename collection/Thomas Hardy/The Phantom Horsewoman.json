    "I",
    "Queer are the ways of a man I know:",
    "He comes and stands",
    "In a careworn craze,",
    "And looks at the sands",
    "And the seaward haze",
    "With moveless hands",
    "And face and gaze,",
    "Then turns to go...",
    "And what does he see when he gazes so?",
    "II",
    "They say he sees as an instant thing",
    "More clear than to-day,",
    "A sweet soft scene",
    "That once was in play",
    "By that briny green;",
    "Yes, notes alway",
    "Warm, real, and keen,",
    "What his back years bring\u2014",
    "A phantom of his own figuring.",
    "III",
    "Of this vision of his they might say more:",
    "Not only there",
    "Does he see this sight,",
    "But everywhere",
    "In his brain\u2013day, night,",
    "As if on the air",
    "It were drawn rose bright\u2013",
    "Yea, far from that shore",
    "Does he carry this vision of heretofore:",
    "IV",
    "A ghost-girl-rider. And though, toil-tried,",
    "He withers daily,",
    "Time touches her not,",
    "But she still rides gaily",
    "In his rapt thought",
    "On that shagged and shaly",
    "Atlantic spot,",
    "And as when first eyed",
    "Draws rein and sings to the swing of the tide."
