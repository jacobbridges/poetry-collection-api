    "They hail me as one living,",
    "But don't they know",
    "That I have died of late years,",
    "Untombed although?",
    "I am but a shape that stands here,",
    "A pulseless mould,",
    "A pale past picture, screening",
    "Ashes gone cold.",
    "Not at a minute's warning,",
    "Not in a loud hour,",
    "For me ceased Time's enchantments",
    "In hall and bower.",
    "There was no tragic transit,",
    "No catch of breath,",
    "When silent seasons inched me",
    "On to this death ....",
    "\u0097 A Troubadour-youth I rambled",
    "With Life for lyre,",
    "The beats of being raging",
    "In me like fire.",
    "But when I practised eyeing",
    "The goal of men,",
    "It iced me, and I perished",
    "A little then.",
    "When passed my friend, my kinsfolk,",
    "Through the Last Door,",
    "And left me standing bleakly,",
    "I died yet more;",
    "And when my Love's heart kindled",
    "In hate of me,",
    "Wherefore I knew not, died I",
    "One more degree.",
    "And if when I died fully",
    "I cannot say,",
    "And changed into the corpse-thing",
    "I am to-day,",
    "Yet is it that, though whiling",
    "The time somehow",
    "In walking, talking, smiling,",
    "I live not now."
