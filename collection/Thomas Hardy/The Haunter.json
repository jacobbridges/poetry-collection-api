    "He does not think that I haunt here nightly:",
    "How shall I let him know",
    "That whither his fancy sets him wandering",
    "I, too, alertly go? -",
    "Hover and hover a few feet from him",
    "Just as I used to do,",
    "But cannot answer the words he lifts me \u2013",
    "Only listen thereto!",
    "When I could answer he did not say them:",
    "When I could let him know",
    "How I would like to join in his journeys",
    "Seldom he wished to go.",
    "Now that he goes and wants me with him",
    "More than he used to do,",
    "Never he sees my faithful phantom",
    "Though he speaks thereto.",
    "Yes, I companion him to places",
    "Only dreamers know,",
    "Where the shy hares print long paces,",
    "Where the night rooks go;",
    "Into old aisles where the past is all to him,",
    "Close as his shade can do,",
    "Always lacking the power to call to him,",
    "Near as I reach thereto!",
    "What a good haunter I am, O tell him,",
    "Quickly make him know",
    "If he but sigh since my loss befell him",
    "Straight to his side I go.",
    "Tell him a faithful one is doing",
    "All that love can do",
    "Still that his path may be worth pursuing,",
    "And to bring peace thereto."
