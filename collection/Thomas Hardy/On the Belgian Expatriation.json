    "I dreamt that people from the Land of Chimes",
    "Arrived one autumn morning with their bells,",
    "To hoist them on the towers and citadels",
    "Of my own country, that the musical rhymes",
    "Rung by them into space at meted times",
    "Amid the market's daily stir and stress,",
    "And the night's empty star-lit silentness,",
    "Might solace souls of this and kindred climes.",
    "Then I awoke; and lo, before me stood",
    "The visioned ones, but pale and full of fear;",
    "From Bruges they came, and Antwerp, and Ostend,",
    "No carillons in their train. Foes of mad mood",
    "Had shattered these to shards amid the gear",
    "Of ravaged roof, and smouldering gable-end."
