    "I",
    "Phantasmal fears,",
    "And the flap of the flame,",
    "And the throb of the clock,",
    "And a loosened slate,",
    "And the blind night's drone,",
    "Which tiredly the spectral pines intone!",
    "II",
    "And the blood in my ears",
    "Strumming always the same,",
    "And the gable-cock",
    "With its fitful grate,",
    "And myself, alone.",
    "III",
    "The twelfth hour nears",
    "Hand-hid, as in shame;",
    "I undo the lock,",
    "And listen, and wait",
    "For the Young Unknown.",

    "In the dark there careers \u2014",
    "As if Death astride came",
    "To numb all with his knock \u2014",

    "No figure appears,",
    "No call of my name,",
    "No sound but 'Tic-toc'",
    "Without check. Past the gate",
    "It clatters \u2014 is gone.",
    "VI",
    "What rider it bears",
    "There is none to proclaim;",
    "And the Old Year has struck,",
    "And, scarce animate,",
    "The New makes moan.",

    "Maybe that 'More Tears! \u2014",
    "More Famine and Flame \u2014",
    "More Severance and Shock!'",
    "Is the order from Fate",
    "That the Rider speeds on",
    "To pale Europe; and tiredly the pines intone."
