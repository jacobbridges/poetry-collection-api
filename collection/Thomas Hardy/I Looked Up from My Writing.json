    "I looked up from my writing,",
    "And gave a start to see,",
    "As if rapt in my inditing,",
    "The moon's full gaze on me.",
    "Her meditative misty head",
    "Was spectral in its air,",
    "And I involuntarily said,",
    "'What are you doing there?'",
    "'Oh, I've been scanning pond and hole",
    "And waterway hereabout",
    "For the body of one with a sunken soul",
    "Who has put his life-light out.",
    "'Did you hear his frenzied tattle?",
    "It was sorrow for his son",
    "Who is slain in brutish battle,",
    "Though he has injured none.",
    "'And now I am curious to look",
    "Into the blinkered mind",
    "Of one who wants to write a book",
    "In a world of such a kind.'",
    "Her temper overwrought me,",
    "And I edged to shun her view,",
    "For I felt assured she thought me",
    "One who should drown him too."
