    "I walked in loamy Wessex lanes, afar",
    "From rail-track and from highway, and I heard",
    "In field and farmstead many an ancient word",
    "Of local lineage like 'Thu bist,' 'Er war,'",
    "'Ich woll', 'Er sholl', and by-talk similar,",
    "Nigh as they speak who in this month's moon gird",
    "At England's very loins, thereunto spurred",
    "By gangs whose glory threats and slaughters are.",
    "Then seemed a Heart crying: 'Whosoever they be",
    "At root and bottom of this, who flung this flame",
    "Between kin folk kin tongued even as are we,",
    "'Sinister, ugly, lurid, be their fame;",
    "May their familiars grow to shun their name,",
    "And their brood perish everlastingly.'"
