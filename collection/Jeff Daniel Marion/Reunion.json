    "Last night in a dream",
    "you came to me. We were young",
    "again and you were smiling,",
    "happy in the way a sparrow in spring",
    "hops from branch to branch.",
    "I took you in my arms",
    "and swung you about, so carefree",
    "was my youth.",
    "What can I say?",
    "That time wears away, draws its lines",
    "on every feature? That we wake",
    "to dark skies whose only answer",
    "is rain, cold as the years",
    "that stretch behind us, blurring",
    "this window far from you."
