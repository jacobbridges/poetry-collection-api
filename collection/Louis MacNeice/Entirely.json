    "And falling twigs of song,",

    "If we could find our happiness entirely",
    "In somebody else\u2019s arms",
    "We should not fear the spears of the spring nor the city\u2019s",
    "Yammering fire alarms",
    "But, as it is, the spears each year go through",
    "Our flesh and almost hourly",
    "Bell or siren banishes the blue",
    "Eyes of Love entirely.",
    "And if the world were black or white entirely",
    "And all the charts were plain",
    "Instead of a mad weir of tigerish waters,",
    "A prism of delight and pain,",
    "We might be surer where we wished to go",
    "Or again we might be merely",
    "Bored but in brute reality there is no",
    "Road that is right entirely."
