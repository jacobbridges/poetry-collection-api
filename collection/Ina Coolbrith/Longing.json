    "O foolish wisdom sought in books!",
    "O aimless fret of household tasks!",
    "O chains that bind the hand and mind\u2014",
    "A fuller life my spirit asks!",
    "For there the grand hills, summer-crowned,",
    "Slope greenly downward to the seas;",
    "One hour of rest upon their breast",
    "Were worth a year of days like these.",
    "Their cool, soft green to ease the pain",
    "Of eyes that ache o\u2019er printed words;",
    "This weary noise \u2013 the city\u2019s voice,",
    "Lulled in the sound of bees and birds.",
    "For Eden\u2019s life within me stirs,",
    "And scorns the shackles that I wear;",
    "The man-life grand \u2013 pure soul, strong hand,",
    "The limb of steel, the heart of air!",
    "And I could kiss, with longing wild,",
    "Earth\u2019s dear brown bosom, loved so much,",
    "A grass-blade fanned across my hand,",
    "Would thrill me like a lover\u2019s touch.",
    "The trees would talk with me; the flowers",
    "Their hidden meanings each make known\u2014",
    "The olden lore revived once more,",
    "When man\u2019s and nature\u2019s heart were one!",
    "And as the pardoned pair might come",
    "Back to the garden God first framed,",
    "And hear Him call at even-fall,",
    "And answer, \u2018Here am I,\u2019 unshamed\u2014",
    "So I, from out these toils, wherein",
    "The Eden-faith grows stained and dim,",
    "Would walk, a child, through nature\u2019s wild,",
    "And hear His voice and answer Him."
