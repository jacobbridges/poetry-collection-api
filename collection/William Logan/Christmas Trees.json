    "How should I now recall",
    "the icy lace of the pane",
    "like a sheet of cellophane,",
    "or the skies of alcohol",
    "poured over the saltbox town?",
    "On that stony New England tableau,",
    "the halo of falling snow",
    "glared like a waxy crown.",
    "Through blue frozen lots",
    "my giant parents strolled,",
    "wrapped tight against the cold",
    "like woolen Argonauts,",
    "searching for that tall",
    "perfection of Scotch pine",
    "from the hundreds laid in line",
    "like the dead at Guadalcanal.",
    "The clapboard village aglow",
    "that starry stark December",
    "I barely now remember,",
    "or the brutish ache of snow",
    "burning my face like quicklime.",
    "Yet one thing was still missing.",
    "I saw my parents kissing,",
    "perhaps for the last time."
