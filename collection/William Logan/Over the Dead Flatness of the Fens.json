    "Like columns of mist",
    "in some temple to a vanished god,",
    "the late cloud-stacks mass over a June",
    "reduced to the sickly greens of the Norfolk broads;",
    "and, above the steam-soiled mess",
    "where earthworms grovel, where lumpish toads",
    "set up the resistances of grace,",
    "where badgers undermine the tarred road,",
    "I watch the canvas of that underpainted sky",
    "through a jellied glass of vermouth",
    "while the gravestone crops up",
    "and an oily wind steels itself to the south.",
    "There certain winged creatures",
    "from a century misplaced on shelves",
    "take the day down with a moaning chant",
    "known to themselves."
