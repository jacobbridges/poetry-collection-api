    "Of the sleeves, I remember their weight, like wet wool,",
    "on my arms, and the empty ends which hung past my hands.",
    "Of the body of the shirt, I remember the large buttons",
    "and larger buttonholes, which made a rack of wheels",
    "down my chest and could not be quickly unbuttoned.",
    "Of the collar, I remember its thickness without starch,",
    "by which it lay against my clavicle without moving.",
    "Of my trousers, the same\u2014heavy, bulky, slow to give",
    "for a leg, a crowded feeling, a molasses to walk in.",
    "Of my boots, I remember the brittle soles, of a material",
    "that had not been made love to by any natural substance,",
    "and the laces: ropes to make prisoners of my feet.",
    "Of the helmet, I remember the webbed, inner liner,",
    "a brittle plastic underwear on which wobbled",
    "the crushing steel pot then strapped at the chin.",
    "Of the mortar, I remember the mortar plate,",
    "heavy enough to kill by weight, which I carried by rope.",
    "Of the machine gun, I remember the way it fit",
    "behind my head and across my shoulder blades",
    "as I carried it, or, to be precise, as it rode me.",
    "Of tactics, I remember the likelihood of shooting",
    "the wrong man, the weight of the rifle bolt, the difficulty",
    "of loading while prone, the shock of noise.",
    "For earplugs, some used cigarette filters or toilet paper.",
    "I don\u2019t hear well now, for a man of my age,",
    "and the doctor says my ears were damaged and asks",
    "if I was in the Army, and of course I was but then",
    "a wounded eardrum wasn\u2019t much in the scheme."
