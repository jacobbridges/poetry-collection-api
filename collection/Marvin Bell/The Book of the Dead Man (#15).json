    "Feeling the upward flow of moisture, the dead man thinks his",
    "resolve has stiffened.",
    "The dead man\u2019s will, will be done.",
    "The dead man\u2019s backbone stretches from rung to rung, from here to",
    "tomorrow, from a fabricated twinge to virtual agony.",
    "The dead man\u2019s disks along his spine are like stepping-stones across",
    "a lake, the doctor told him \u201cjelly doughnuts\u201d when they",
    "ruptured, this is better.",
    "The dead man\u2019s hernial groin is like a canvas bridge across a",
    "chasm, the doctor said \u201cballoon\u201d when they operated,",
    "this is better.",
    "The dead man\u2019s toes are like sanded free forms and his heels are as",
    "smooth as the backs of new shoes, the doctor said \u201ccorns\u201d",

    "geographies in microcosm, all the canyons are visible, now",
    "washed of random hairs that rooted, now free of the",
    "strangulated optics of retinal sense, this is better.",
    "All the dead man\u2019s organs, his skin, muscles, tendons, arteries, veins,",
