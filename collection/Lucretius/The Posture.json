    "Of like importance is the posture too,",
    "In which the genial feat of Love we do:",
    "For as the females of the four foot kind,",
    "Receive the leapings of their Males behind;",
    "So the good Wives, with loins uplifted high,",
    "And leaning on their hands the fruitful stroke may try:",
    "For in that posture will they best conceive:",
    "Not when supinely laid they frisk and heave;",
    "For active motions only break the blow,",
    "And more of Strumpets than of Wives they show;",
    "When answering stroke with stroke, the mingled liquors flow.",
    "Endearments eager, and too brisk a bound,",
    "Throws off the Plow-share from the furrow\u2019d ground.",
    "But common Harlots in conjunction heave,",
    "Because \u2019tis less their business to conceive",
    "Than to delight, and to provoke the deed;",
    "A trick which honest Wives but little need."
