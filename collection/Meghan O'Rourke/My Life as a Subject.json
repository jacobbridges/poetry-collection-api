    "I",
    "Because I was born in a kingdom,",
    "there was a king. At times",
    "the king was a despot; at other times,",
    "not. Axes flashed in the road",
    "at night, but if you closed your eyes",
    "and sang the old ballads",
    "sitting on the well edge",
    "amongst your kinspeople",
    "then the silver did not appear",
    "to be broken.",
    "Such were the circumstances.",
    "They made a liar out of me.",
    "Did they change my spirit?",
    "Kith in the night",
    "the sound of owls. A bird fight.",
    "II",
    "We also had a queen,",
    "whetted by the moon. And",
    "we her subjects,",
    "softening in her sight.",
    "III",
    "What one had",
    "the other had to",
    "have too. Soon",
    "parrots bloomed",
    "in every garden, and",
    "every daughter",
    "had a tuning fork",
    "jeweled with emeralds.",
    "IV",
    "Learning to hunt in the new empire,",
    "the king invited his subjects",
    "to send him their knives.",
    "He tested these knives on oranges,",
    "pomegranates, acorn squash,",
    "soft birches, stillborns, prisoners",
    "who had broken rules. He used them",
    "on the teeth of traitors.",
    "V",
    "When strangers massed at the borders,",
    "the courtiers practiced",
    "subjection of the foreign. The court",
    "held a procession",
    "of twine, rope,",
    "gold, knife, light, and",
    "prostitutes with their vials of white",
    "powder. Smoke coursed into the courtyard,",
    "and we wrought hunger upon",
    "the bodies of strangers. I am sure you",
    "can imagine",
    "it, really what need",
    "is there for me to tell you?",
    "You were a stranger once too, and I",
    "brought rope.",
    "VI",
    "Afterward, I always slept,",
    "and let the dealers",
    "come to me alone",
    "with jewels.",
    "VII",
    "In the court at night, we debated",
    "the skin of language,",
    "questioned what might",
    "one day be revealed inside:",
    "a pink and soft fruit,",
    "a woman in a field. . .",
    "Or a shadow, sticky and loose",
    "as old jam. Our own",
    "dialect was abstract,",
    "we wished to understand",
    "not how things were",
    "but what spectacle we might",
    "make from them.",
    "VIII",
    "One day a merchant",
    "brought moving pictures,",
    "the emperor's new delight.",
    "He tacked dark cloth to all",
    "the windows, top",
    "and bottom, and turned",
    "the lights off, cranking the machine like",
    "a needle and thread",
    "making forms into which",
    "we could insinuate our cold",
    "bodies and find warmth. Light; dark.",
    "And the sliding images of courtiers",
    "merrily balancing pineapples",
    "on their heads, as if this",
    "were an adequate story.",
    "IX",
    "And our queen, that hidden",
    "self. What became",
    "of her? Slid into the night",
    "like a statue, and felt",
    "around into shadows,",
    "nothing to prove, all worldly",
    "latitudes, knowing as a spider",
    "in retreat. The web",
    "her mind, and in it, the fly.",
    "X",
    "On Sundays, we flew kites",
    "to ensure our joy",
    "was seen by all those who",
    "threatened",
    "to threaten us. The thread",
    "spooling out up high",
    "in the purple sky",
    "and silver gelatin films being made,",
    "sliding through the cranking machine",
    "so that the barbarians could know",
    "we made images of ourselves",
    "coated in precious metal",
    "and sent them away",
    "indifferent to our wealth.",
    "I miss the citrus",
    "smell of spring",
    "on the plaza filled",
    "with young",
    "and long-limbed kite flyers.",
    "XI",
    "Do I have anything else",
    "to add? Only that",
    "I obeyed my king, my",
    "kind, I was not faithless.",
    "Should I be punished",
    "for that? It is true",
    "some of my pictures creak unhappily",
    "through the spindle.",
    "It is true one day they",
    "came to my house. I know",
    "the powder we coated our fingers",
    "with made us thirsty",
    "and sometimes cruel. But I was born",
    "with a spirit like you.",
    "I have woken, you see,",
    "and I wish to be",
    "made new."
