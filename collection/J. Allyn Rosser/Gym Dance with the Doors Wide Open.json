    "When the fog slunk in with that salivary,",
    "close, coyote panting, its hue a very",
    "huelessness, like breath huffed on a glass,",
    "like the void stretched and still stretching past",
    "where we\u2019d thought it could, we felt less wary.",
    "We felt our shoulders loosen, surrendering",
    "to phantom hands and softly vanished feet.",
    "The sensation was a first and last: sweet",
    "to feel the vigilance at last suspending,",
    "the chronic stress of constantly pretending",
    "to know\u2014have known!\u2014what all the others knew.",
    "Loopy, sly, we leered at one another",
    "(what we just assumed was one another)",
    "and did the things we weren\u2019t supposed to do,",
    "grinning as if seated in the back pew",
    "of a church that worshipped fuss and bother,",
    "a dour church where facial expression",
    "of any kind had been prohibited,",
    "and where the chinking, hefty plate we shifted",
    "hand to hand held such a vast collection",
    "of their coin, we pocketed a fraction",
    "for when the fog would lift, if it lifted.",
    "But stealing from them puts you in their power.",
    "Since then we have been paying for that hour."
