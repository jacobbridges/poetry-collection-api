    "One can\u2019t help admiring",
    "their rickety grace",
    "and old-world feathers",
    "like seasoned boardwalk planks.",
    "They pass in silent pairs,",
    "as if a long time ago",
    "they had wearied of calling out.",
    "The wind tips them, their",
    "ungainly, light-brown weight,",
    "into a prehistoric wobble,",
    "wings\u2019-end fingers stretching",
    "from fingerless gloves,",
    "necks slightly tucked and stiff,",
    "peering forward and down,",
    "like old couples arm in arm",
    "on icy sidewalks, careful,",
    "careful, mildly surprised",
    "by how difficult it has become",
    "to stay dignified and keep moving",
    "even after the yelping gulls have gone;",
    "even after the scattered sand,",
    "and the quietly lodged complaints."
