    "You move around me expertly like the good, round",
    "Italian barber I went to in Florence,",
    "years before we met, his scissors",
    "a razor he sharpened on a belt.",
    "But at first when you were learning, I feared",
    "for my neck, saw my ears like sliced fruit",
    "on the newspapered floor. Taking us back in time,",
    "you cleverly clipped my head in a flat-top.",
    "The years in between were styles no one had ever seen,",
    "or should see again: when the wind rose",
    "half my hair floated off in feathers,",
    "the other half bristling, brief as a brush.",
    "In the chair, almost asleep, I hear the bright",
    "scissors dancing. Hear you hum, full-breasted as Aida,",
    "carefully trimming the white from my temples,",
    "so no one, not even I, will know."
