    "I walked out, and the nest",
    "was already there by the step. Woven basket",
    "of a saint",
    "sent back to life as a bird",
    "who proceeded to make",
    "a mess of things. Wind",
    "right through it, and any eggs",
    "long vanished. But in my hand it was",
    "intricate pleasure, even the thorny reeds",
    "softened in the weave. And the fading",
    "leaf mold, hardly",
    "itself anymore, merely a trick",
    "of light, if light",
    "can be tricked. Deep in a life",
    "is another life. I walked out, the nest",
    "already by the step."
