    "It begins with the lewd macarena",
    "each of us performs in the shower,",
    "then the modified twist we are hip to",
    "with that ever-absorbent partner, the towel,",
    "and on to the funky chicken of stepping into underwear,",
    "the shimmy of stretching into hose.",
    "There is no music, none that anyone",
    "can hear, yet no one can escape the boogie.",
    "Outside beneath the disco ball of the Sun",
    "no one is a wallflower, not even the two lugs",
    "in the crosswalk lugging a huge mirror,",
    "one at either end pressing his cheek",
    "into the cheek of his own reflection, arm",
    "extended, hand clasping his own hand in a tango",
    "more about control than passion, one couple",
    "leading himself forward, the other slide-stepping",
    "backwards across the intersection made double",
    "by the infinite burden they shoulder together.",
    "At the entrances of buildings even those afflicted",
    "with two left feet find grace with a stranger",
    "in a revolving door, where, regardless of gender,",
    "we share a pause and glance to communicate",
    "who will lead, who will follow,",
    "close to each other but never quite touching."
