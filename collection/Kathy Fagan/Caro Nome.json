    "jewel-toned as the flowers unattached to the card, or hot like the cardinal",
    "who pins the whole picture up",
    "with your eye. Meanwhile,",
    "her tree is an iron room with the moon inside. Its branches",

    "I am the color of that tree",
    "she loves and nearly as still. And my blood, which is not in this picture,",
    "will soon cool, sunset winking out in my eyes and her eyes",
    "welling in a language that once fell and rose",
    "in drifts then melted, starry, she said, starry, into my warm coat."
