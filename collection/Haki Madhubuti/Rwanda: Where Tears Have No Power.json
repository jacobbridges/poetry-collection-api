    "Who has the moral high ground?",
    "Fifteen blocks from the whitehouse",
    "on small corners in northwest, d.c.",
    "boys disguised as me rip each other\u2019s hearts out",
    "with weapons made in china. they fight for territory.",
    "across the planet in a land where civilization was born",
    "the boys of d.c. know nothing about their distant relatives",
    "in Rwanda. they have never heard of the hutu or tutsi people.",
    "their eyes draw blanks at the mention of kigali, byumba",
    "or butare. all they know are the streets of d.c., and do not",
    "cry at funerals anymore. numbers and frequency have a way",
    "of making murder commonplace and not news",
    "unless it spreads outside of our house, block, territory.",
    "modern massacres are intraethnic. bosnia, sri lanka, burundi,",
    "nagorno-karabakh, iraq, laos, angola, liberia, and rwanda are",
    "small foreign names on a map made in europe. when bodies",
    "by the tens of thousands float down a river turning the water",
    "the color of blood, as a quarter of a million people flee barefoot",
    "into tanzania and zaire, somehow we notice. we do not smile,",
    "we have no more tears. we hold our thoughts. In deeply",
    "muted silence looking south and thinking that today",
    "nelson mandela seems much larger",
    "than he is."
