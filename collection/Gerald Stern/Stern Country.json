    "For sleeplessness, your head face down, your shoulder blades",
    "floating and aspirin as a last resort, when",
    "death is threatening, though lately I have experimented",
    "with numbers and as for dreams I've never been boring",
    "and only once did I bite the arm of a woman",
    "sitting next to me and I should be careful,",
    "she might have a hand-written poem or a memoir",
    "and didn't I bite her arm and aren't we both",
    "poets, though I warn her that I make gurgling",
    "noises and twitch in both legs and make the bed",
    "jump and I am exhausted from looking at poems",
    "and I don't care about her nuts and bolts",
    "and she has to go to the wilderness herself",
    "and fuck the exercises, let her get smashed",
    "by a Mack truck, then she'll be ready to mourn."
