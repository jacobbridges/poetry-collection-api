    "Bing Crosby died in Spain",
    "while playing golf with Franco",
    "but who could care less, and at this",
    "writing only a few of",

    "as if to prove a point,",
    "fly into the light and make",
    "a mockery out of our darkness.",
    "They scream for food but in",
    "the world of shadows they only",
    "make a quick motion; I have",
    "studied them\u2014the whiter",
    "the wall is\u2014the barer the bulb\u2014",
    "the more they scream, the more",
    "they dip down. I have made",
    "my two hands into a shape",
    "and I have darkened the wall",
    "to see what it looks like\u2014I have",
    "shortened my two broken fingers",
    "to make the small tail and twisted",
    "the knuckles sideways so when",
    "they come in to eat one shadow",
    "overtakes the other, that way",
    "I can live in the darkness",
    "with Franco's poisonous head",
    "and Crosby's ears, who fainted,",
    "a thousand to one, behind a",
    "number two club, though no swift",
    "died for him, well, for them,",
    "digging for clubs. I watch the",
    "birds every night; they fly",
    "in a great circle, much larger",
    "than what I can see, their dipping",
    "is what I dreaded in front of",
    "my plain white wall\u2014I say it",
    "for the nine hundred Americans",
    "who died in Spain. I thought",
    "I'd have to wait forever",
    "to do them a tiny justice",
    "and listen to their songs",
    "and die a little from the foolhardy",
    "mournful words, flying down",
    "one air current or another",
    "and doing the sides of buildings",
    "and tops of trees, the low-lying",
    "straggling dogwood, the full-bodied",
    "huge red maple, my dear ones."
