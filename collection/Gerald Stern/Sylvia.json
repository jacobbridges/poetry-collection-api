    "Across a space peopled with stars I am",
    "laughing while my sides ache for existence",
    "it turns out is profound though the profound",
    "because of time it turns out is an illusion",
    "and all of this is infinitely improbable",
    "given the space, for which I gratefully lie",
    "in three feet of snow making a shallow grave",
    "I would have called an angel otherwise and",
    "think of my own rapturous escape from",
    "living only as dust and dirt, little sister."
