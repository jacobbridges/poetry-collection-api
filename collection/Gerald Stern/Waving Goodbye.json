    "I wanted to know what it was like before we",
    "had voices and before we had bare fingers and before we",
    "had minds to move us through our actions",
    "and tears to help us over our feelings,",
    "so I drove my daughter through the snow to meet her friend",
    "and filled her car with suitcases and hugged her",
    "as an animal would, pressing my forehead against her,",
    "walking in circles, moaning, touching her cheek,",
    "and turned my head after them as an animal would,",
    "watching helplessly as they drove over the ruts,",
    "her smiling face and her small hand just visible",
    "over the giant pillows and coat hangers",
    "as they made their turn into the empty highway."
