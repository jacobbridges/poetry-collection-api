    "Our shadows bring them from the shadows:",
    "a yolk-yellow one with a navy pattern",
    "like a Japanese woodblock print of fish scales.",
    "A fat 18-karat one splashed with gaudy purple",
    "and a patch of gray. One with a gold head,",
    "a body skim-milk-white, trailing ventral fins",
    "like half-folded fans of lace.",
    "A poppy-red, faintly disheveled one,",
    "and one, compact, all indigo in faint green water.",
    "They wear comical whiskers and gather beneath us",
    "as we lean on the cement railing",
    "in indecisive late-December light,",
    "and because we do not feed them, they pass,",
    "then they loop and circle back. Loop and circle. Loop.",
    "\u201cLook,\u201d you say, \u201cbeneath them.\u201d Beneath them,",
    "like a subplot or a motive, is a school",
    "of uniformly dark ones, smaller, unadorned,",
    "perhaps another species, living in the shadow",
    "of the gold, purple, yellow, indigo, and white,",
    "seeking the mired roots and dusky grasses,",
    "unliveried, the quieter beneath the quiet."
