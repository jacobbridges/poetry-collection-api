    "Home, then, where the past was.",
    "Then, where cold pastorals repeated",
    "their entreaties, where a portrait of Christ",
    "hung in every bedroom. Then was a different",
    "country in a different climate in a time when",
    "souls were won and lost in prairie tents. It was.",
    "It was. Then it was a dream. I had no will there.",
    "Then the new continent and the new wife",
    "and the new language for no, for unsaved,",
    "for communion on credit. Then the daughter",
    "who should\u2019ve been mine, and the hour a shadow",
    "outgrew its body. She was all of my failures,",
    "my sermon on the tender comforts of hatred",
    "in the shape of a girl. Then the knowledge",
    "of God like an apple in the mouth. I faced",
    "my temptation. I touched its breasts with",
    "as much restraint as my need allowed,",
    "and I woke with its left hand traced again",
    "and again on my chest like a cave wall",
    "disfigured by right-handed gods who tried",
    "to escape the stone. It was holy. It was fading.",
    "My ring, then, on my finger like an ambush,",
    "as alive as fire. Then the trees offered me a city",
    "in the shape of a word followed by a word",
    "followed by a blue madonna swinging from",
    "the branches. A choir filed out of the jungle",
    "singing hallelujah like a victory march and it was."
