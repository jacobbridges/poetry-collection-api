    "LO, praise of the prowess of people-kings",
    "of spear-armed Danes, in days long sped,",
    "we have heard, and what honor the athelings won!",
    "Oft Scyld the Scefing from squadroned foes,",
    "from many a tribe, the mead-bench tore,",
    "awing the earls. Since erst he lay",
    "friendless, a foundling, fate repaid him:",
    "for he waxed under welkin, in wealth he throve,",
    "till before him the folk, both far and near,",
    "who house by the whale-path, heard his mandate,",
    "gave him gifts: a good king he!",
    "To him an heir was afterward born,",
    "a son in his halls, whom heaven sent",
    "to favor the folk, feeling their woe",
    "that erst they had lacked an earl for leader",
    "so long a while; the Lord endowed him,",
    "the Wielder of Wonder, with world\u2019s renown.",
    "Famed was this Beowulf: far flew the boast of him,",
    "son of Scyld, in the Scandian lands.",
    "So becomes it a youth to quit him well",
    "with his father\u2019s friends, by fee and gift,",
    "that to aid him, aged, in after days,",
    "come warriors willing, should war draw nigh,",
    "liegemen loyal: by lauded deeds",
    "shall an earl have honor in every clan.",
    "Forth he fared at the fated moment,",
    "sturdy Scyld to the shelter of God.",
    "Then they bore him over to ocean\u2019s billow,",
    "loving clansmen, as late he charged them,",
    "while wielded words the winsome Scyld,",
    "the leader beloved who long had ruled....",
    "In the roadstead rocked a ring-dight vessel,",
    "ice-flecked, outbound, atheling\u2019s barge:",
    "there laid they down their darling lord",
    "on the breast of the boat, the breaker-of-rings,",
    "by the mast the mighty one. Many a treasure",
    "fetched from far was freighted with him.",
    "No ship have I known so nobly dight",
    "with weapons of war and weeds of battle,",
    "with breastplate and blade: on his bosom lay",
    "a heaped hoard that hence should go",
    "far o\u2019er the flood with him floating away.",
    "No less these loaded the lordly gifts,",
    "thanes\u2019 huge treasure, than those had done",
    "who in former time forth had sent him",
    "sole on the seas, a suckling child.",
    "High o\u2019er his head they hoist the standard,",
    "a gold-wove banner; let billows take him,",
    "gave him to ocean. Grave were their spirits,",
    "mournful their mood. No man is able",
    "to say in sooth, no son of the halls,",
    "no hero \u2018neath heaven, \u2014 who harbored that freight!",
    "Now Beowulf bode in the burg of the Scyldings,",
    "leader beloved, and long he ruled",
    "in fame with all folk, since his father had gone",
    "away from the world, till awoke an heir,",
    "haughty Healfdene, who held through life,",
    "sage and sturdy, the Scyldings glad.",
    "Then, one after one, there woke to him,",
    "to the chieftain of clansmen, children four:",
    "Heorogar, then Hrothgar, then Halga brave;",
    "and I heard that \u2014 was \u2014\u2019s queen,",
    "the Heathoscylfing\u2019s helpmate dear.",
    "To Hrothgar was given such glory of war,",
    "such honor of combat, that all his kin",
    "obeyed him gladly till great grew his band",
    "of youthful comrades. It came in his mind",
    "to bid his henchmen a hall uprear,",
    "a master mead-house, mightier far",
    "than ever was seen by the sons of earth,",
    "and within it, then, to old and young",
    "he would all allot that the Lord had sent him,",
    "save only the land and the lives of his men.",
    "Wide, I heard, was the work commanded,",
    "for many a tribe this mid-earth round,",
    "to fashion the folkstead. It fell, as he ordered,",
    "in rapid achievement that ready it stood there,",
    "of halls the noblest: Heorot he named it",
    "whose message had might in many a land.",
    "Not reckless of promise, the rings he dealt,",
    "treasure at banquet: there towered the hall,",
    "high, gabled wide, the hot surge waiting",
    "of furious flame. Nor far was that day",
    "when father and son-in-law stood in feud",
    "for warfare and hatred that woke again.",
    "With envy and anger an evil spirit",
    "endured the dole in his dark abode,",
    "that he heard each day the din of revel",
    "high in the hall: there harps rang out,",
    "clear song of the singer. He sang who knew",
    "tales of the early time of man,",
    "how the Almighty made the earth,",
    "fairest fields enfolded by water,",
    "set, triumphant, sun and moon",
    "for a light to lighten the land-dwellers,",
    "and braided bright the breast of earth",
    "with limbs and leaves, made life for all",
    "of mortal beings that breathe and move.",
    "So lived the clansmen in cheer and revel",
    "a winsome life, till one began",
    "to fashion evils, that field of hell.",
    "Grendel this monster grim was called,",
    "march-riever mighty, in moorland living,",
    "in fen and fastness; fief of the giants",
    "the hapless wight a while had kept",
    "since the Creator his exile doomed.",
    "On kin of Cain was the killing avenged",
    "by sovran God for slaughtered Abel.",
    "Ill fared his feud, and far was he driven,",
    "for the slaughter\u2019s sake, from sight of men.",
    "Of Cain awoke all that woful breed,",
    "Etins and elves and evil-spirits,",
    "as well as the giants that warred with God",
    "weary while: but their wage was paid them!",
    "WENT he forth to find at fall of night",
    "that haughty house, and heed wherever",
    "the Ring-Danes, outrevelled, to rest had gone.",
    "Found within it the atheling band",
    "asleep after feasting and fearless of sorrow,",
    "of human hardship. Unhallowed wight,",
    "grim and greedy, he grasped betimes,",
    "wrathful, reckless, from resting-places,",
    "thirty of the thanes, and thence he rushed",
    "fain of his fell spoil, faring homeward,",
    "laden with slaughter, his lair to seek.",
    "Then at the dawning, as day was breaking,",
    "the might of Grendel to men was known;",
    "then after wassail was wail uplifted,",
    "loud moan in the morn. The mighty chief,",
    "atheling excellent, unblithe sat,",
    "labored in woe for the loss of his thanes,",
    "when once had been traced the trail of the fiend,",
    "spirit accurst: too cruel that sorrow,",
    "too long, too loathsome. Not late the respite;",
    "with night returning, anew began",
    "ruthless murder; he recked no whit,",
    "firm in his guilt, of the feud and crime.",
    "They were easy to find who elsewhere sought",
    "in room remote their rest at night,",
    "bed in the bowers, when that bale was shown,",
    "was seen in sooth, with surest token, \u2014",
    "the hall-thane\u2019s hate. Such held themselves",
    "far and fast who the fiend outran!",
    "Thus ruled unrighteous and raged his fill",
    "one against all; until empty stood",
    "that lordly building, and long it bode so.",
    "Twelve years\u2019 tide the trouble he bore,",
    "sovran of Scyldings, sorrows in plenty,",
    "boundless cares. There came unhidden",
    "tidings true to the tribes of men,",
    "in sorrowful songs, how ceaselessly Grendel",
    "harassed Hrothgar, what hate he bore him,",
    "what murder and massacre, many a year,",
    "feud unfading, \u2014 refused consent",
    "to deal with any of Daneland\u2019s earls,",
    "make pact of peace, or compound for gold:",
    "still less did the wise men ween to get",
    "great fee for the feud from his fiendish hands.",
    "But the evil one ambushed old and young",
    "death-shadow dark, and dogged them still,",
    "lured, or lurked in the livelong night",
    "of misty moorlands: men may say not",
    "where the haunts of these Hell-Runes be.",
    "Such heaping of horrors the hater of men,",
    "lonely roamer, wrought unceasing,",
    "harassings heavy. O\u2019er Heorot he lorded,",
    "gold-bright hall, in gloomy nights;",
    "and ne\u2019er could the prince approach his throne,",
    "\u2014 \u2018twas judgment of God, \u2014 or have joy in his hall.",
    "Sore was the sorrow to Scyldings\u2019-friend,",
    "heart-rending misery. Many nobles",
    "sat assembled, and searched out counsel",
    "how it were best for bold-hearted men",
    "against harassing terror to try their hand.",
    "Whiles they vowed in their heathen fanes",
    "altar-offerings, asked with words",
    "that the slayer-of-souls would succor give them",
    "for the pain of their people. Their practice this,",
    "their heathen hope; \u2018twas Hell they thought of",
    "in mood of their mind. Almighty they knew not,",
    "Doomsman of Deeds and dreadful Lord,",
    "nor Heaven\u2019s-Helmet heeded they ever,",
    "Wielder-of-Wonder. \u2014 Woe for that man",
    "who in harm and hatred hales his soul",
    "to fiery embraces; \u2014 nor favor nor change",
    "awaits he ever. But well for him",
    "that after death-day may draw to his Lord,",
    "and friendship find in the Father\u2019s arms!",
    "THUS seethed unceasing the son of Healfdene",
    "with the woe of these days; not wisest men",
    "assuaged his sorrow; too sore the anguish,",
    "loathly and long, that lay on his folk,",
    "most baneful of burdens and bales of the night.",
    "This heard in his home Hygelac\u2019s thane,",
    "great among Geats, of Grendel\u2019s doings.",
    "He was the mightiest man of valor",
    "in that same day of this our life,",
    "stalwart and stately. A stout wave-walker",
    "he bade make ready. Yon battle-king, said he,",
    "far o\u2019er the swan-road he fain would seek,",
    "the noble monarch who needed men!",
    "The prince\u2019s journey by prudent folk",
    "was little blamed, though they loved him dear;",
    "they whetted the hero, and hailed good omens.",
    "And now the bold one from bands of Geats",
    "comrades chose, the keenest of warriors",
    "e\u2019er he could find; with fourteen men",
    "the sea-wood he sought, and, sailor proved,",
    "led them on to the land\u2019s confines.",
    "Time had now flown; afloat was the ship,",
    "boat under bluff. On board they climbed,",
    "warriors ready; waves were churning",
    "sea with sand; the sailors bore",
    "on the breast of the bark their bright array,",
    "their mail and weapons: the men pushed off,",
    "on its willing way, the well-braced craft.",
    "Then moved o\u2019er the waters by might of the wind",
    "that bark like a bird with breast of foam,",
    "till in season due, on the second day,",
    "the curved prow such course had run",
    "that sailors now could see the land,",
    "sea-cliffs shining, steep high hills,",
    "headlands broad. Their haven was found,",
    "their journey ended. Up then quickly",
    "the Weders\u2019 clansmen climbed ashore,",
    "anchored their sea-wood, with armor clashing",
    "and gear of battle: God they thanked",
    "for passing in peace o\u2019er the paths of the sea.",
    "Now saw from the cliff a Scylding clansman,",
    "a warden that watched the water-side,",
    "how they bore o\u2019er the gangway glittering shields,",
    "war-gear in readiness; wonder seized him",
    "to know what manner of men they were.",
    "Straight to the strand his steed he rode,",
    "Hrothgar\u2019s henchman; with hand of might",
    "he shook his spear, and spake in parley.",
    "\u201cWho are ye, then, ye armed men,",
    "mailed folk, that yon mighty vessel",
    "have urged thus over the ocean ways,",
    "here o\u2019er the waters? A warden I,",
    "sentinel set o\u2019er the sea-march here,",
    "lest any foe to the folk of Danes",
    "with harrying fleet should harm the land.",
    "No aliens ever at ease thus bore them,",
    "linden-wielders: yet word-of-leave",
    "clearly ye lack from clansmen here,",
    "my folk\u2019s agreement. \u2014 A greater ne\u2019er saw I",
    "of warriors in world than is one of you, \u2014",
    "yon hero in harness! No henchman he",
    "worthied by weapons, if witness his features,",
    "his peerless presence! I pray you, though, tell",
    "your folk and home, lest hence ye fare",
    "suspect to wander your way as spies",
    "in Danish land. Now, dwellers afar,",
    "ocean-travellers, take from me",
    "simple advice: the sooner the better",
    "I hear of the country whence ye came.\u201d",
    "To him the stateliest spake in answer;",
    "the warriors\u2019 leader his word-hoard unlocked:\u2014",
    "\u201cWe are by kin of the clan of Geats,",
    "and Hygelac\u2019s own hearth-fellows we.",
    "To folk afar was my father known,",
    "noble atheling, Ecgtheow named.",
    "Full of winters, he fared away",
    "aged from earth; he is honored still",
    "through width of the world by wise men all.",
    "To thy lord and liege in loyal mood",
    "we hasten hither, to Healfdene\u2019s son,",
    "people-protector: be pleased to advise us!",
    "To that mighty-one come we on mickle errand,",
    "to the lord of the Danes; nor deem I right",
    "that aught be hidden. We hear \u2014 thou knowest",
    "if sooth it is \u2014 the saying of men,",
    "that amid the Scyldings a scathing monster,",
    "dark ill-doer, in dusky nights",
    "shows terrific his rage unmatched,",
    "hatred and murder. To Hrothgar I",
    "in greatness of soul would succor bring,",
    "so the Wise-and-Brave may worst his foes, \u2014",
    "if ever the end of ills is fated,",
    "of cruel contest, if cure shall follow,",
    "and the boiling care-waves cooler grow;",
    "else ever afterward anguish-days",
    "he shall suffer in sorrow while stands in place",
    "high on its hill that house unpeered!\u201d",
    "Astride his steed, the strand-ward answered,",
    "clansman unquailing: \u201cThe keen-souled thane",
    "must be skilled to sever and sunder duly",
    "words and works, if he well intends.",
    "I gather, this band is graciously bent",
    "to the Scyldings\u2019 master. March, then, bearing",
    "weapons and weeds the way I show you.",
    "I will bid my men your boat meanwhile",
    "to guard for fear lest foemen come, \u2014",
    "your new-tarred ship by shore of ocean",
    "faithfully watching till once again",
    "it waft o\u2019er the waters those well-loved thanes,",
    "\u2014 winding-neck\u2019d wood, \u2014 to Weders\u2019 bounds,",
    "heroes such as the hest of fate",
    "shall succor and save from the shock of war.\u201d",
    "They bent them to march, \u2014 the boat lay still,",
    "fettered by cable and fast at anchor,",
    "broad-bosomed ship. \u2014 Then shone the boars",
    "over the cheek-guard; chased with gold,",
    "keen and gleaming, guard it kept",
    "o\u2019er the man of war, as marched along",
    "heroes in haste, till the hall they saw,",
    "broad of gable and bright with gold:",
    "that was the fairest, \u2018mid folk of earth,",
    "of houses \u2018neath heaven, where Hrothgar lived,",
    "and the gleam of it lightened o\u2019er lands afar.",
    "The sturdy shieldsman showed that bright",
    "burg-of-the-boldest; bade them go",
    "straightway thither; his steed then turned,",
    "hardy hero, and hailed them thus:\u2014",
    "\u201cTis time that I fare from you. Father Almighty",
    "in grace and mercy guard you well,",
    "safe in your seekings. Seaward I go,",
    "\u2018gainst hostile warriors hold my watch.\u201d",
    "STONE-BRIGHT the street: it showed the way",
    "to the crowd of clansmen. Corselets glistened",
    "hand-forged, hard; on their harness bright",
    "the steel ring sang, as they strode along",
    "in mail of battle, and marched to the hall.",
    "There, weary of ocean, the wall along",
    "they set their bucklers, their broad shields, down,",
    "and bowed them to bench: the breastplates clanged,",
    "war-gear of men; their weapons stacked,",
    "spears of the seafarers stood together,",
    "gray-tipped ash: that iron band",
    "was worthily weaponed! \u2014 A warrior proud",
    "asked of the heroes their home and kin.",
    "\u201cWhence, now, bear ye burnished shields,",
    "harness gray and helmets grim,",
    "spears in multitude? Messenger, I,",
    "Hrothgar\u2019s herald! Heroes so many",
    "ne\u2019er met I as strangers of mood so strong.",
    "\u2018Tis plain that for prowess, not plunged into exile,",
    "for high-hearted valor, Hrothgar ye seek!\u201d",
    "Him the sturdy-in-war bespake with words,",
    "proud earl of the Weders answer made,",
    "hardy \u2018neath helmet:\u2014\u201dHygelac\u2019s, we,",
    "fellows at board; I am Beowulf named.",
    "I am seeking to say to the son of Healfdene",
    "this mission of mine, to thy master-lord,",
    "the doughty prince, if he deign at all",
    "grace that we greet him, the good one, now.\u201d",
    "Wulfgar spake, the Wendles\u2019 chieftain,",
    "whose might of mind to many was known,",
    "his courage and counsel: \u201cThe king of Danes,",
    "the Scyldings\u2019 friend, I fain will tell,",
    "the Breaker-of-Rings, as the boon thou askest,",
    "the famed prince, of thy faring hither,",
    "and, swiftly after, such answer bring",
    "as the doughty monarch may deign to give.\u201d",
    "Hied then in haste to where Hrothgar sat",
    "white-haired and old, his earls about him,",
    "till the stout thane stood at the shoulder there",
    "of the Danish king: good courtier he!",
    "Wulfgar spake to his winsome lord:\u2014",

    "to give them hearing, gracious Hrothgar!",
    "In weeds of the warrior worthy they,",
    "methinks, of our liking; their leader most surely,",
    "a hero that hither his henchmen has led.\u201d",
    "HROTHGAR answered, helmet of Scyldings:\u2014",
    "\u201cI knew him of yore in his youthful days;",
    "his aged father was Ecgtheow named,",
    "to whom, at home, gave Hrethel the Geat",

    "And seamen, too, have said me this, \u2014",

    "thither for thanks, \u2014 he has thirty men\u2019s",

    "out of his mercy this man hath sent",
    "to Danes of the West, as I ween indeed,",
    "against horror of Grendel. I hope to give",
    "the good youth gold for his gallant thought.",
    "Be thou in haste, and bid them hither,",
    "clan of kinsmen, to come before me;",
    "and add this word, \u2014 they are welcome guests",
    "to folk of the Danes.\u201d [To the door of the hall",

    "\u201cTo you this message my master sends,",

    "battle-gear guarding, as bade the chief.",
    "Then hied that troop where the herald led them,",
    "under Heorot\u2019s roof: [the hero strode,]",
    "hardy \u2018neath helm, till the hearth he neared.",
    "Beowulf spake, \u2014 his breastplate gleamed,",
    "war-net woven by wit of the smith:\u2014",

    "nicors by night, in need and peril",
    "avenging the Weders, whose woe they sought, \u2014",
    "crushing the grim ones. Grendel now,",
    "monster cruel, be mine to quell",
    "in single battle! So, from thee,",
    "thou sovran of the Shining-Danes,",

    "and the bone-frame burst. To Beowulf now",
    "the glory was given, and Grendel thence",
    "death-sick his den in the dark moor sought,",
    "noisome abode: he knew too well",
    "that here was the last of life, an end",
    "of his days on earth. \u2014 To all the Danes",
    "by that bloody battle the boon had come.",
    "From ravage had rescued the roving stranger",

    "bound word to word in well-knit rime,",
    "welded his lay; this warrior soon",
    "of Beowulf\u2019s quest right cleverly sang,",

    "fair lay earth\u2019s breast; and fain was the rover,",

    "A sword to the boat-guard Beowulf gave,",

    "assigned me a seat by his son and heir.",
    "The liegemen were lusty; my life-days never",

    "by devilish craft, of dragon-skins.",

    "on the floor of the ocean that outcast fell.",
    "Me for this struggle the Scyldings\u2019-friend",
    "paid in plenty with plates of gold,",

    "Then was song and glee. The gray-haired Scylding,",
    "much tested, told of the times of yore.",
    "Whiles the hero his harp bestirred,",
    "wood-of-delight; now lays he chanted",
    "of sooth and sadness, or said aright",
    "legends of wonder, the wide-hearted king;",
    "or for years of his youth he would yearn at times,",
    "for strength of old struggles, now stricken with age,",

    "Thus in the hall the whole of that day",
    "at ease we feasted, till fell o\u2019er earth",

    "set forth all doleful. Dead was her son",
    "through war-hate of Weders; now, woman monstrous",
    "with fury fell a foeman she slew,",

    "loyal councillor, life was gone;",
    "nor might they e\u2019en, when morning broke,",

    "burn with brands, on balefire lay",

    "she had carried the corpse with cruel hands.",

    "her head I hewed with a hardy blade",
    "from Grendel\u2019s mother, \u2014 and gained my life,",
    "though not without danger. My doom was not yet.",
    "Then the haven-of-heroes, Healfdene\u2019s son,",

    "And I heard that soon passed o\u2019er the path of this treasure,",
    "all apple-fallow, four good steeds,",
    "each like the others, arms and horses",
    "he gave to the king. So should kinsmen be,",
    "not weave one another the net of wiles,",
    "or with deep-hid treachery death contrive",
    "for neighbor and comrade. His nephew was ever",
    "by hardy Hygelac held full dear,",
    "and each kept watch o\u2019er the other\u2019s weal.",
    "I heard, too, the necklace to Hygd he presented,",
    "wonder-wrought treasure, which Wealhtheow gave him",
    "sovran\u2019s daughter: three steeds he added,",
    "slender and saddle-gay. Since such gift",
    "the gem gleamed bright on the breast of the queen.",
    "Thus showed his strain the son of Ecgtheow",
    "as a man remarked for mighty deeds",

    "Then the bulwark-of-earls bade bring within,",
    "hardy chieftain, Hrethel\u2019s heirloom",
    "garnished with gold: no Geat e\u2019er knew",
    "in shape of a sword a statelier prize.",
    "The brand he laid in Beowulf\u2019s lap;",

    "because of his rule o\u2019er the realm itself.",
    "Now further it fell with the flight of years,",

    "sought hardy heroes, Heatho-Scilfings,",
    "in arms o\u2019erwhelming Hereric\u2019s nephew.",
    "Then Beowulf came as king this broad",
    "realm to wield; and he ruled it well",

    "warding his land, until One began",
    "in the dark of night, a Dragon, to rage.",
    "In the grave on the hill a hoard it guarded,",

    "prince and people must pay betimes!",
    "THAT way he went with no will of his own,",
    "in danger of life, to the dragon\u2019s hoard,",
    "but for pressure of peril, some prince\u2019s thane.",
    "He fled in fear the fatal scourge,",
    "seeking shelter, a sinful man,",
    "and entered in. At the awful sight",
    "tottered that guest, and terror seized him;",
    "yet the wretched fugitive rallied anon",
    "from fright and fear ere he fled away,",
    "and took the cup from that treasure-hoard.",
    "Of such besides there was store enough,",

    "or to cleanse the carven cup of price,",
    "beaker bright. My brave are gone.",
    "And the helmet hard, all haughty with gold,",

    "contest-crash, since, conqueror proud,",

    "and in grapple had killed the kin of Grendel,",

    "each human wight: let him hide it who will! \u2014",
    "His glance too fell on a gold-wove banner",

    "Haethcyn Hrethling of hope and life,",
    "when the folk of Geats for the first time sought",
    "in wanton pride the Warlike-Scylfings.",
    "Soon the sage old sire of Ohtere,",

    "He had tested Hygelac\u2019s hardihood,",
    "the proud one\u2019s prowess, would prove it no longer,",
    "defied no more those fighting-wanderers",
    "nor hoped from the seamen to save his hoard,",

    "old, to his earth-walls. Yet after him came",
    "with slaughter for Swedes the standards of Hygelac",
    "o\u2019er peaceful plains in pride advancing,",
    "till Hrethelings fought in the fenced town.",
    "Then Ongentheow with edge of sword,",
    "the hoary-bearded, was held at bay,",
    "and the folk-king there was forced to suffer",
    "Eofor\u2019s anger. In ire, at the king",
    "Wulf Wonreding with weapon struck;",
    "and the chieftain\u2019s blood, for that blow, in streams",
    "flowed \u2018neath his hair. No fear felt he,",
    "stout old Scylfing, but straightway repaid",
    "in better bargain that bitter stroke",

    "when his brother fell, with broad brand smote,",
    "giants\u2019 sword crashing through giants\u2019-helm",
    "across the shield-wall: sank the king,",
    "his folk\u2019s old herdsman, fatally hurt.",
    "There were many to bind the brother\u2019s wounds",
    "and lift him, fast as fate allowed",
    "his people to wield the place-of-war.",
    "But Eofor took from Ongentheow,",
    "earl from other, the iron-breastplate,",
    "hard sword hilted, and helmet too,",

    "Each of them had a hundred thousand",
    "in land and linked rings; nor at less price reckoned",

    "death-hate of men: so I deem it sure",

    "when once they learn that our warrior leader",
    "lifeless lies, who land and hoard",
    "ever defended from all his foes,",
    "furthered his folk\u2019s weal, finished his course",
    "a hardy hero. \u2014 Now haste is best,",
    "that we go to gaze on our Geatish lord,",
    "and bear the bountiful breaker-of-rings",

    "gold untold and gained in terror,",
    "treasure at last with his life obtained,",

    "nay, sad in spirit and shorn of her gold,",
    "oft shall she pass o\u2019er paths of exile",
    "now our lord all laughter has laid aside,",
    "all mirth and revel. Many a spear",

    "lifted aloft; nor shall lilt of harp",
    "those warriors wake; but the wan-hued raven,",
    "fain o\u2019er the fallen, his feast shall praise",
    "and boast to the eagle how bravely he ate",
    "when he and the wolf were wasting the slain.\u201d",
    "So he told his sorrowful tidings,",
    "and little he lied, the loyal man",
    "of word or of work. The warriors rose;",
    "sad, they climbed to the Cliff-of-Eagles,",
    "went, welling with tears, the wonder to view.",
    "Found on the sand there, stretched at rest,",
    "their lifeless lord, who had lavished rings",
    "of old upon them. Ending-day",
    "had dawned on the doughty-one; death had seized",
    "in woful slaughter the Weders\u2019 king.",
    "There saw they, besides, the strangest being,",
    "loathsome, lying their leader near,",
    "prone on the field. The fiery dragon,",
    "fearful fiend, with flame was scorched.",
    "Reckoned by feet, it was fifty measures",
    "in length as it lay. Aloft erewhile",
    "it had revelled by night, and anon come back,",
    "seeking its den; now in death\u2019s sure clutch",
    "it had come to the end of its earth-hall joys.",
    "By it there stood the stoups and jars;",
    "dishes lay there, and dear-decked swords",
    "eaten with rust, as, on earth\u2019s lap resting,",
    "a thousand winters they waited there.",
    "For all that heritage huge, that gold",
    "of bygone men, was bound by a spell,",
    "so the treasure-hall could be touched by none",
    "of human kind, \u2014 save that Heaven\u2019s King,",
    "God himself, might give whom he would,",
    "Helper of Heroes, the hoard to open, \u2014",
    "even such a man as seemed to him meet.",
    "A PERILOUS path, it proved, he trod",
    "who heinously hid, that hall within,",
    "wealth under wall! Its watcher had killed",
    "one of a few, and the feud was avenged",
    "in woful fashion. Wondrous seems it,",
    "what manner a man of might and valor",
    "oft ends his life, when the earl no longer",
    "in mead-hall may live with loving friends.",
    "So Beowulf, when that barrow\u2019s warden",
    "he sought, and the struggle; himself knew not",
    "in what wise he should wend from the world at last.",
    "For princes potent, who placed the gold,",
    "with a curse to doomsday covered it deep,",
    "so that marked with sin the man should be,",
    "hedged with horrors, in hell-bonds fast,",
    "racked with plagues, who should rob their hoard.",
    "Yet no greed for gold, but the grace of heaven,",
    "ever the king had kept in view.",
    "Wiglaf spake, the son of Weohstan:\u2014",
    "\u201cAt the mandate of one, oft warriors many",
    "sorrow must suffer; and so must we.",
    "The people\u2019s-shepherd showed not aught",
    "of care for our counsel, king beloved!",
    "That guardian of gold he should grapple not, urged we,",
    "but let him lie where he long had been",
    "in his earth-hall waiting the end of the world,",
    "the hest of heaven. \u2014 This hoard is ours",
    "but grievously gotten; too grim the fate",
    "which thither carried our king and lord.",
    "I was within there, and all I viewed,",
    "the chambered treasure, when chance allowed me",
    "(and my path was made in no pleasant wise)",
    "under the earth-wall. Eager, I seized",
    "such heap from the hoard as hands could bear",
    "and hurriedly carried it hither back",
    "to my liege and lord. Alive was he still,",
    "still wielding his wits. The wise old man",
    "spake much in his sorrow, and sent you greetings",
    "and bade that ye build, when he breathed no more,",
    "on the place of his balefire a barrow high,",
    "memorial mighty. Of men was he",
    "worthiest warrior wide earth o\u2019er",
    "the while he had joy of his jewels and burg.",
    "Let us set out in haste now, the second time",
    "to see and search this store of treasure,",
    "these wall-hid wonders, \u2014 the way I show you, \u2014",
    "where, gathered near, ye may gaze your fill",
    "at broad-gold and rings. Let the bier, soon made,",
    "be all in order when out we come,",
    "our king and captain to carry thither",
    "\u2014 man beloved \u2014 where long he shall bide",
    "safe in the shelter of sovran God.\u201d",
    "Then the bairn of Weohstan bade command,",
    "hardy chief, to heroes many",
    "that owned their homesteads, hither to bring",
    "firewood from far \u2014 o\u2019er the folk they ruled \u2014",
    "for the famed-one\u2019s funeral. \u201c Fire shall devour",
    "and wan flames feed on the fearless warrior",
    "who oft stood stout in the iron-shower,",
    "when, sped from the string, a storm of arrows",
    "shot o\u2019er the shield-wall: the shaft held firm,",
    "featly feathered, followed the barb.\u201d",
    "And now the sage young son of Weohstan",
    "seven chose of the chieftain\u2019s thanes,",
    "the best he found that band within,",
    "and went with these warriors, one of eight,",
    "under hostile roof. In hand one bore",
    "a lighted torch and led the way.",
    "No lots they cast for keeping the hoard",
    "when once the warriors saw it in hall,",
    "altogether without a guardian,",
    "lying there lost. And little they mourned",
    "when they had hastily haled it out,",
    "dear-bought treasure! The dragon they cast,",
    "the worm, o\u2019er the wall for the wave to take,",
    "and surges swallowed that shepherd of gems.",
    "Then the woven gold on a wain was laden \u2014",
    "countless quite! \u2014 and the king was borne,",
    "hoary hero, to Hrones-Ness.",
    "THEN fashioned for him the folk of Geats",
    "firm on the earth a funeral-pile,",
    "and hung it with helmets and harness of war",
    "and breastplates bright, as the boon he asked;",
    "and they laid amid it the mighty chieftain,",
    "heroes mourning their master dear.",
    "Then on the hill that hugest of balefires",
    "the warriors wakened. Wood-smoke rose",
    "black over blaze, and blent was the roar",
    "of flame with weeping (the wind was still),",
    "till the fire had broken the frame of bones,",
    "hot at the heart. In heavy mood",
    "their misery moaned they, their master\u2019s death.",
    "Wailing her woe, the widow old,",
    "her hair upbound, for Beowulf\u2019s death",
    "sung in her sorrow, and said full oft",
    "she dreaded the doleful days to come,",
    "deaths enow, and doom of battle,",
    "and shame. \u2014 The smoke by the sky was devoured.",
    "The folk of the Weders fashioned there",
    "on the headland a barrow broad and high,",
    "by ocean-farers far descried:",
    "in ten days\u2019 time their toil had raised it,",
    "the battle-brave\u2019s beacon. Round brands of the pyre",
    "a wall they built, the worthiest ever",
    "that wit could prompt in their wisest men.",
    "They placed in the barrow that precious booty,",
    "the rounds and the rings they had reft erewhile,",

    "trusting the ground with treasure of earls,",
    "gold in the earth, where ever it lies",
    "useless to men as of yore it was.",
    "Then about that barrow the battle-keen rode,",

    "heartily love, when hence he goes",
    "from life in the body forlorn away.",
    "Thus made their mourning the men of Geatland,",
    "for their hero\u2019s passing his hearth-companions:",
