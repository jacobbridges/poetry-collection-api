    "Pangur B\u00e1n and I at work,",

    "Adds up to its own reward:",
    "Concentration, stealthy art.",
    "Next thing an unwary mouse",
    "Bares his flank: Pangur pounces.",
    "Next thing lines that held and held",
    "Meaning back begin to yield.",
    "All the while, his round bright eye",
    "Fixes on the wall, while I",
    "Focus my less piercing gaze",
    "On the challenge of the page.",
    "With his unsheathed, perfect nails",
    "Pangur springs, exults and kills.",
    "When the longed-for, difficult",
    "Answers come, I too exult.",
    "So it goes. To each his own.",
    "No vying. No vexation.",
    "Taking pleasure, taking pains,",
    "Kindred spirits, veterans.",
    "Day and night, soft purr, soft pad,",
    "Pangur B\u00e1n has learned his trade.",
    "Day and night, my own hard work",
    "Solves the cruxes, makes a mark."
