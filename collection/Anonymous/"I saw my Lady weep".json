    "I saw my Lady weep,",
    "And Sorrow proud to be advanced so",
    "In those fair eyes, where all perfections keep;",
    "Her face was full of woe,",
    "But such a woe (believe me) as wins more hearts",
    "Than mirth can do, with her enticing parts.",
    "Sorrow was there made fair,",
    "And Passion, wise; Tears, a delightful thing;",
    "Silence, beyond all speech, a wisdom rare;",
    "She made her sighs to sing,",
    "And all things with so sweet a sadness move;",
    "As made my heart both grieve and love.",
    "O Fairer than aught else",
    "The world can shew, leave off, in time, to grieve,",
    "Enough, enough! Your joyful look excels;",
    "Tears kill the heart, believe,",
    "O strive not to be excellent in woe,",
    "Which only breeds your beauty\u2019s overthrow."
