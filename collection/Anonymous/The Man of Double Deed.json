    "There was a man of double deed,",
    "Who sowed his garden full of seed;",
    "When the seed began to grow,",
    "'Twas like a garden full of snow;",
    "When the snow began to melt,",
    "'Twas like a ship without a belt;",
    "When the ship began to sail,",
    "'Twas like a bird without a tail;",
    "When the bird began to fly,",
    "'Twas like an eagle in the sky;",
    "When the sky began to roar,",
    "'Twas like a lion at my door;",
    "When my door began to crack,",
    "'Twas like a stick across my back;",
    "When my back began to smart,",
    "'Twas like a penknife in my heart;",
    "And when my heart began to bleed,",
    "'Twas death, and death, and death indeed."
