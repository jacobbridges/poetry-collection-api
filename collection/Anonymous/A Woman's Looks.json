    "A woman\u2019s looks",
    "Are barbed hooks,",
    "That catch by art",
    "The strongest heart,",
    "When yet they spend no breath.",
    "But let them speak,",
    "And sighing break",
    "Forth into tears,",
    "Their words are spears",
    "That wound our souls to death.",
    "The rarest wit",
    "Is made forget,",
    "And like a child",
    "Is oft beguiled",
    "With Love\u2019s sweet-seeming bait.",
    "Love with his rod",
    "So like a god",
    "Commands the mind",
    "We cannot find,",
    "Fair shows hide foul deceit.",
    "Time, that all things",
    "In order brings,",
    "Hath taught me now",
    "To be more slow",
    "In giving faith to speech:",
    "Since women\u2019s words",
    "No truth affords,",
    "And when they kiss",
    "They think by this",
    "Us men to overreach."
