    "In the Bavarian steeple, on the hour,",
    "two figures emerge from their scalloped house",
    "carrying sledges that they clap, in turn,",
    "against the surface of the bell. By legend",
    "they are summer and winter, youth and age,",
    "as though the forces of plenty and of loss",
    "played equally on the human soul, extracted",
    "easily the same low bronze note spreading",
    "upward from the encumbrance of the village,",
    "past alluvial fields to the pocked highland",
    "where cattle shift their massive heads",
    "at this dissonance, this faint redundant",
    "pressure in the ears, in the air.",
    "From the village, the mountain seems",
    "a single stone, a single blank completion.",
    "Seeing the summit pierce the abstract heavens,",
    "we reconstruct the valley on the mountain\u2014",
    "a shepherd propped against his crook, birds",
    "enthralled on a branch, the branch feathering",
    "the edge of the canvas\u2014transposing",
    "such forms as can extend the flawed earth",
    "and embody us, intact, unaltering, among",
    "the soft surprising trees of childhood,",
    "mimosa, honey locust and willow.",
    "Wood in the midst of woods, the village",
    "houses are allied in a formal shape",
    "beside a stream, the streets concluding",
    "at the monument. Again the ravishing moment",
    "of the bell: the townspeople, curious",
    "or accustomed, stop to count the strokes,",
    "odd or even\u2014the confectioner counting out",
    "the lavendar candies for his customer,",
    "the butcher, the greengrocer, the surgeon",
    "and the constable\u2014as the housewife",
    "stands on the stoop, shaking her mop,",
    "and sees the dust briefly veil the air,",
    "an algebra of swirling particles."
