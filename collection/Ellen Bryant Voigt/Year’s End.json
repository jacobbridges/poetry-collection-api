    "separate, lonely, as in the field",
    "the separate blades of grass",
    "shrivel or grow tall.",
    "We sat together in the little room,",
    "the walls blotched with steam,",
    "holding the baby as if the two of us",
    "could breathe for him and were not helpless.",
    "Upstairs, his sister turned in her sleep",
    "as the phone rang\u2014",
    "to have wakened to a child\u2019s cry,",
    "gagged and desperate,",
    "and then repeat that terror when the call",
    "split the quiet house and centered",
    "its dire message:",
    "a child was dead",
    "and his mother so wrung by grief",
    "she stared and stared",
    "at the moon on its black stalk,",
    "the road glistening like wire.",
    "Rubbing the window clear of steam",
    "as a child rubs sleep from its eyes,",
    "and looking past the fence to where",
    "he had plunged the sled up and down the hill,",
    "we could still see the holes his feet made,",
    "a staggered row of graves",
    "extracting darkness from the snow.",
    "When morning brought the new year in,",
    "the fever broke, and fresh snow",
    "bandaged the tracks on the hill.",
    "For a long time we stayed in the room,",
    "listening to him breathe,",
    "like refugees who listen to the sea,",
    "unable to fully rejoice, or fully grieve."
