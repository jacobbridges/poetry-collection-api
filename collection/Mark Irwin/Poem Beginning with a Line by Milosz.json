    "\u201cThe most beautiful bodies are like transparent glass.\u201d",
    "They are bodies of the selfless or of those newly",
    "dead. What appears transparent is really flame",
    "burning so brightly it appears like glass. What",
    "you\u2019re looking through is the act of giving: One",
    "thing in life needed desperately, given to another,",
    "or perhaps life itself. The most beautiful bodies",
    "are not transparent, but sometimes the color",
    "of lead, like the elephant whom a child with some",
    "peanuts lifts by the trunk in his hand in the swirling",
    "dust, so that it appears he has lifted a monument",
    "or a city with all its pain. The bodies that seem",
    "transparent are made of an ice so pure it appears",
    "to be glass sweating, where you, desiring another,",
    "glimpse your own face that weighs nothing and is burning."
