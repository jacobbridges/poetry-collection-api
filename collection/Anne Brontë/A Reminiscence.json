    "YES, thou art gone! and never more",
    "Thy sunny smile shall gladden me;",
    "But I may pass the old church door,",
    "And pace the floor that covers thee.",
    "May stand upon the cold, damp stone,",
    "And think that, frozen, lies below",
    "The lightest heart that I have known,",
    "The kindest I shall ever know.",
    "Yet, though I cannot see thee more,",
    "'Tis still a comfort to have seen;",
    "And though thy transient life is o'er,",
    "'Tis sweet to think that thou hast been;",
    "To think a soul so near divine,",
    "Within a form so angel fair,",
    "United to a heart like thine,",
    "Has gladdened once our humble sphere."
