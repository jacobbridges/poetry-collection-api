    "There, garland dandelions round that idol",
    "with a corn husk face & beard",
    "patched with rat stubble from a barber\u2019s dust pan,",
    "parade float driven by a carriage pulled by a pig.",
    "Two sticks knotted together,",
    "cake frost on that crude wood to make it gilt.",
    "There, spider cranks & iron gyres,",
    "blueberry stain glass sprout",
    "like wings from coal burn cars,",
    "a trumpet toots the sorrow of another boy dead,",
    "there he is, limp on a gurney wrapped in gingham scrap,",
    "there, he\u2019s blast.",
    "There, roofless houses,",
    "sarong utopias balloon, balloon toward the sky,",
    "while women beat, beat their skulls.",
    "I trail behind, mop in hand,",
    "sloshing scum water over memorials.",
    "There he stares at my tic-torn cankered face,",
    "& begs for alms, his face horse rudder red.",
    "A son, he huffs, it is a son I want.",
    "I spit into them corned mitt hands."
