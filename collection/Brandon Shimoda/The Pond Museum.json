    "The fenestrate surface of the pond",
    "surfaces in old companions snag ripples",
    "namely, Saburo",
    "I recommend his face for the pond museum",
    "above the fox\u2019s skulking face",
    "the hare\u2019s face, death\u2019s polished stone",
    "the crane\u2019s larval pearl",
    "eyes transmitting the code for a sodden voice",
    "in the splintering reeds",
    "And when I say I recommend",
    "I mean the menagerie in the utmost dark",
    "saviors hung from supping trees",
    "gone the way of idiot flesh\u2014where you",
    "were endowed with a chance, and fucked up",
    "Evening, I went down",
    "on the pantry, pried open",
    "a basket of rice cakes, grew",
    "partial to eating in the dark",
    "if only to concentrate the sound",
    "of walking through the wilderness",
    "at night, enlarged",
    "without people",
    "as wax I sleep in nectar",
    "When was the flora brass",
    "A woman kneeling among cranes",
    "Willows waiting",
    "for sticks to arrive",
    "to burn cranes from her body",
    "genital",
    "wind through which",
    "No, it has always been this way",
    "blooms erupting",
    "suspicion, husband",
    "making sure each dawn",
    "the sticks stay lashed to his back, the wood",
    "she waits for",
    "thin as blades, and cut as close",
    "To fallow soil",
    "sea dragon in hand",
    "proper, yes, though petrified",
    "crimson, pink, indigo, green",
    "purple and yellow lotus",
    "cradle in the hedgerow",
    "I feel",
    "faint exceptionally",
    "hot here on the ground",
    "Should I be sweating this much?",
    "Should the sea dragon weigh so heavily?",
    "Bronze skin festooning the trees",
    "cutting a spirit loose?",
    "Carrion flowers",
    "slip",
    "from my hand"
