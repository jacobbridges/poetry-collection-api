    "The guards sleep they breathe uneven",
    "Conversation with the",
    "Trees the sharp cicadas",
    "And knots of pine the flames",
    "Have stirred to talk: their light",
    "Shows him rolling in his bonds",
    "As if he dragged his bones",
    "Again beyond a tall",
    "And ghosted mist of blood;",
    "He took three hundred lives",
    "And will not give his own for capture",
    "Even. The smell of searing",
    "Hemp and flesh startles",
    "As the scream of birds\u2014",
    "Should wake the guards of men",
    "Or dead. The fire flares and frames",
    "A running giant his wrists",
    "Caught between his thighs;",
    "A burned and awkward god.",
    "Once he tried the foxes\u2019",
    "Paths out of the shattered quarry.",
    "No way now. One may",
    "Kill his hundreds; still",
    "No way. How can he live",
    "Without his heart. Throw him",
    "To the ground and prepare knives!",
    "Do they by their hate",
    "Or wonder break the breast",
    "He shut to fear? Mock",
    "Or pray as they cut flesh",
    "Crush ribs and lay all open",
    "To the alien chill of air?",
    "No scream tears",
    "From him; the tiny veins",
    "Along his eyelid swell",
    "And pools of sweat gather at its corners.",
    "But they do not see his",
    "Slowly swinging eyes.",
    "They watch his heart; its brown",
    "Hair is whorled and dry."
