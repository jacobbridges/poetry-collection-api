    "Exert thy voice, sweet harbinger of spring!",
    "This moment is thy time to sing,",
    "This moment I attend to praise,",
    "And set my numbers to they lays.",
    "Free as thine shall be my song;",
    "As they music, short, or long.",
    "Poets, wild as thee, were born,",
    "Pleasing best when unconfined,",
    "When to please is least designed,",
    "Soothing but their cares to rest;",
    "Cares do still their thoughts molest,",
    "And still th' unhappy poet's breast,",
    "Like thine, when best he sings, is placed against a thorn.",
    "She begins, Let all be still!",
    "Muse, they promise now fulfill!",
    "Sweet, oh! sweet, still sweeter yet",
    "Can thy words such accents fit,",
    "Canst thou syllables refine,",
    "Melt a sense that shall retain",
    "Still some spirit of the brain,",
    "Till with sounds like these it join.",
    "'Twill not be! then change thy note;",
    "Let division shake thy throat.",
    "Hark! Division now she tries;",
    "Yet as far the Muse outflies.",
    "Cease then, prithee, cease thy tune;",
    "Trifler, wilt thou sing till *June*?",
    "Till thy business all lies waste,",
    "And the time of building's past!",
    "Thus we poets that have speech,",
    "Unlike what they forests teach,",
    "If a fluent vein be shown",
    "That's transcendant to our own,",
    "Criticize, reform, or preach,",
    "Or censure what we cannot reach."
