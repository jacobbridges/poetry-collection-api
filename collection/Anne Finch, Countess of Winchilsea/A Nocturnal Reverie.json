    "In such a night, when every louder wind",
    "Is to its distant cavern safe confined;",
    "And only gentle Zephyr fans his wings,",
    "And lonely Philomel, still waking, sings;",
    "Or from some tree, famed for the owl\u2019s delight,",
    "She, hollowing clear, directs the wand\u2019rer right:",
    "In such a night, when passing clouds give place,",
    "Or thinly veil the heav\u2019ns\u2019 mysterious face;",
    "When in some river, overhung with green,",
    "The waving moon and the trembling leaves are seen;",
    "When freshened grass now bears itself upright,",
    "And makes cool banks to pleasing rest invite,",
    "Whence springs the woodbind, and the bramble-rose,",
    "And where the sleepy cowslip sheltered grows;",
    "Whilst now a paler hue the foxglove takes,",
    "Yet checkers still with red the dusky brakes",
    "When scatter\u2019d glow-worms, but in twilight fine,",
    "Shew trivial beauties, watch their hour to shine;",
    "Whilst Salisb\u2019ry stands the test of every light,",
    "In perfect charms, and perfect virtue bright:",
    "When odors, which declined repelling day,",
    "Through temp\u2019rate air uninterrupted stray;",
    "When darkened groves their softest shadows wear,",
    "And falling waters we distinctly hear;",
    "When through the gloom more venerable shows",
    "Some ancient fabric, awful in repose,",
    "While sunburnt hills their swarthy looks conceal,",
    "And swelling haycocks thicken up the vale:",
    "When the loosed horse now, as his pasture leads,",
    "Comes slowly grazing through th\u2019 adjoining meads,",
    "Whose stealing pace, and lengthened shade we fear,",
    "Till torn-up forage in his teeth we hear:",
    "When nibbling sheep at large pursue their food,",
    "And unmolested kine rechew the cud;",
    "When curlews cry beneath the village walls,",
    "And to her straggling brood the partridge calls;",
    "Their shortlived jubilee the creatures keep,",
    "Which but endures, whilst tyrant man does sleep;",
    "When a sedate content the spirit feels,",
    "And no fierce light disturbs, whilst it reveals;",
    "But silent musings urge the mind to seek",
    "Something, too high for syllables to speak;",
    "Till the free soul to a composedness charmed,",
    "Finding the elements of rage disarmed,",
    "O\u2019er all below a solemn quiet grown,",
    "Joys in th\u2019 inferior world, and thinks it like her own:",
    "In such a night let me abroad remain,",
    "Till morning breaks, and all\u2019s confused again;",
    "Our cares, our toils, our clamors are renewed,",
    "Or pleasures, seldom reached, again pursued."
