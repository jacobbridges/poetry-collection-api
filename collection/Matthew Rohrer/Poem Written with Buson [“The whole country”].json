    "The whole country",
    "in a courtly dance",
    "its tiny mouth open",
    "I pour another cup of wine",
    "and falling, rising",
    "the children remove their toys",
    "around the small apartment",
    "to their bunk beds",
    "not quite dark yet",
    "early spring with snow",
    "on the wind",
    "the woman across the street",
    "bent like a sickle",
    "collecting bottles and cans",
    "knocks, goes on",
    "I wonder where she lives",
    "and the stars shining",
    "on her greasy clothes"
