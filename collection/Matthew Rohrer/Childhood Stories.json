    "They learned to turn off the gravity in an auditorium",
    "and we all rose into the air,",
    "the same room where they demonstrated",

    "But not everyone believed it.",
    "That was the most important lesson",
    "I learned\u2014that a truck driven by a dog",
    "could roll down a hill at dusk",
    "and roll right off a dock into a lake",
    "and sink, and if no one believes you",
    "then what is the point",
    "of telling them wonderful things?",
    "I walked home from the pow-wow",
    "on an early winter night in amazement:",
    "they let me buy the toy tomahawk!",
    "As soon as I got home I was going",
    "to hit my sister with it, but I didn\u2019t know this."
