    "I will enter you as hope enters me,",
    "through blinding liquid, light of rain, and I",
    "will stay inside until you send me out;",
    "I will stay inside until you ground me.",
    "We cannot outrun the rain. So many",
    "summers I have tried. So many summers.",
    "But when the rumble calls after the spark",
    "there can be no escape. No outstripping",
    "the drench soak, the wet sheath, the water caul.",
    "This is more than you want to hear. Much more",
    "than I want to tell you. Tabernacle",
    "transporting my life from the desert, you,",
    "the faith I am born and reborn into,",
    "you, rescuer, deliverer of rain."
