    "Henry pulled our heartwood along the rutted street",
    "that town stood beside, built two rooms",
    "and called them home. My Henry did that.",
    "There. And I lived all those days inside his love.",
    "But there is a kind of hunger that feeds",
    "on flesh. Only, let it be yearning, heaving,",
    "rising flesh. Only, let it be flesh living",
    "and loving. Alive. Let it be life.",
    "There is a kind of hunger that feeds on life.",
    "They carved into him with banquet knives,",
    "made stew of his skin and stirred it",
    "with his own bones. My Henry served: the meat",
    "and the pot to cook it in. And there was no charge",
    "against the men who made that meal."
