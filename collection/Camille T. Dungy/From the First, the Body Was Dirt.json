    "Whose hands touched, first, the head",
    "of the penis, the shaft?",
    "And was it soft",
    "or shale? More rock",
    "than clay.",
    "And who pinched first",
    "into their place the small cups",
    "at the base of the ass?",
    "Who was it",
    "got down there, on whose knees,",
    "and blew\u2014",
    "and was that passion",
    "or panic, the machine that drove",
    "those exhalations?",
    "\u2014and how",
    "could we rate the power of that",
    "breath\u2014breeze or gale or a whisper",
    "like the song the little boy sings",
    "to the beetle,",
    "whose small legs moved in tune",
    "like his legs, the legs on that first body, must have",
    "moved, if they did move, when",
    "the dust settled.",
    "In my mind everything\u2019s become enormous.",
    "But was it ever small like that, the first body?",
    "Did it ever sit close to the ants and their piles",
    "of dirt from which that body had come?",
    "You were a small boy once, I suppose.",
    "You were dirty from the start.",
    "You showed me how to use a cock ring,",
    "and why.",
    "How, without ever paying",
    "for a room, to spend two weeks in any city.",
    "How two men could fuck",
    "and continue to face each other",
    "directly",
    "\u2014took my body and showed me,",
    "my back on a table, my knees by my head.",
    "Stretched me",
    "into seeing you were more than a dog.",
    "You must be dead by now, though I don\u2019t know",
    "whose hands prepared you.",
    "Whose fingers",
    "fingered, for the final time,",
    "all that dark and kinky hair?",
    "If the first body was made of dirt,",
    "in order to plumb the hollow",
    "of that first throat, whose thumb",
    "first lodged inside the hinge",
    "of that first mouth to force it open?",
    "To make the tongue, so it could work,",
    "who shoved inside that mouth",
    "the shit of a hundred thousand worms?"
