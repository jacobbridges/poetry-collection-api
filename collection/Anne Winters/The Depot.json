    "finds you botanizing some mast-high aisle",
    "in the Depot. Fazed by stock-names and numbers, distinctions",
    "like drip-forged and molly- and carborundum-steel,",
    "or, in DIMENSIONAL LUMBER, the trunk chart. Its dotted lines",
    "follow core cuts, mere spindles, out to the perimeter or \u201cwane,\u201d",
