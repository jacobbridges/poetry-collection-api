    "Nature, that washed her hands in milk,",
    "And had forgot to dry them,",
    "Instead of earth took snow and silk,",
    "At love\u2019s request to try them,",
    "If she a mistress could compose",
    "To please love\u2019s fancy out of those.",
    "Her eyes he would should be of light,",
    "A violet breath, and lips of jelly;",
    "Her hair not black, nor overbright,",
    "And of the softest down her belly;",
    "As for her inside he\u2019d have it",
    "Only of wantonness and wit.",
    "At love\u2019s entreaty such a one",
    "Nature made, but with her beauty",
    "She hath framed a heart of stone;",
    "So as love, by ill destiny,",
    "Must die for her whom nature gave him,",
    "Because her darling would not save him.",
    "But time (which nature doth despise,",
    "And rudely gives her love the lie,",
    "Makes hope a fool, and sorrow wise)",
    "His hands do neither wash nor dry;",
    "But being made of steel and rust,",
    "Turns snow and silk and milk to dust.",
    "The light, the belly, lips, and breath,",
    "He dims, discolors, and destroys;",
    "With those he feeds but fills not death,",
    "Which sometimes were the food of joys.",
    "Yea, time doth dull each lively wit,",
    "And dries all wantonness with it.",
    "Oh, cruel time! which takes in trust",
    "Our youth, our joys, and all we have,",
    "And pays us but with age and dust;",
    "Who in the dark and silent grave",
    "When we have wandered all our ways",
    "Shuts up the story of our days."
