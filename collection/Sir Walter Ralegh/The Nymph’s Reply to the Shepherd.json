    "If all the world and love were young,",
    "And truth in every Shepherd\u2019s tongue,",
    "These pretty pleasures might me move,",
    "To live with thee, and be thy love.",
    "Time drives the flocks from field to fold,",
    "When Rivers rage and Rocks grow cold,",
    "And",
    "becometh dumb,",
    "The rest complains of cares to come.",
    "The flowers do fade, and wanton fields,",
    "To wayward winter reckoning yields,",
    "A honey tongue, a heart of gall,",
    "Is fancy\u2019s spring, but sorrow\u2019s fall.",
    "Thy gowns, thy shoes, thy beds of Roses,",
    "Thy cap, thy kirtle, and thy posies",
    "Soon break, soon wither, soon forgotten:",
    "In folly ripe, in reason rotten.",
    "Thy belt of straw and Ivy buds,",
    "The Coral clasps and amber studs,",
    "All these in me no means can move",
    "To come to thee and be thy love.",
    "But could youth last, and love still breed,",
    "Had joys no date, nor age no need,",
    "Then these delights my mind might move",
    "To live with thee, and be thy love."
