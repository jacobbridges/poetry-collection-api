    "This is how it is with me:",
    "so strong, I want to draw the egg",
    "from your womb and nourish it in my own.",
    "I want to mother your child made only",
    "of us, of me, you: no borrowed seed",
    "from any man. I want to re-fashion",
    "the matrix of creation, make a human being",
    "from the human love that passes between",
    "our bodies. Sweetheart, this is how it is:",
    "when you emerge from the bedroom",
    "in a clean cotton shirt, sleeves pushed back",
    "over forearms, scented with cologne",
    "from an amber bottle\u2014I want to open",
    "my heart, the brightest aching slit",
    "of my soul, receive your pearl.",
    "I watch your hands, wait for the sign",
    "that means you\u2019ll touch me,",
    "open me, fill me; wait for that moment",
    "when your desire leaps inside me."
