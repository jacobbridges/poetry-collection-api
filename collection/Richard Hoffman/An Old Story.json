    "A few days after my mother died",
    "the furnace went out, and my father,",
    "who had been sitting in his chair",
    "across from hers since the funeral,",
    "his unshaven chin on his chest,",
    "heaved himself up and went down",
    "the cold gray cellar stairs to see if",
    "he could relight the pilot himself",
    "or would have to call for help.",
    "I know what it must have been like",
    "because I remember him other times",
    "on his back down there, cursing",
    "match after match, god damning",
    "each for burning his fingers, as he",
    "reached through the tiny metal door",
    "as many times as it took. This time",
    "it lit, caught, and roared back to life.",
    "When my father sat up he faced",
    "the washer, the dryer, the empty",
    "laundry basket, the ironing board,",
    "and my mother\u2019s radio above the sink,",
    "her absence so vivid that climbing",
    "the stairs he thought he heard her",
    "behind him, and he turned around."
