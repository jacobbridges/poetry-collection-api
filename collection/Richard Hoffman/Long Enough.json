    "You would have thought it foolish to speak to the dead,",
    "but I have lived two decades longer now than you",
    "and all this time I have carried you in my head",
    "so I think I have the right to question what you said,",
    "dear teacher. My religious upbringing\u2019s residue,",
    "you would have thought it foolish. To speak to the dead,",
    "however, is sometimes necessary, especially haunted",
    "by all the things I know you hoped I\u2019d do",
    "with all this time that I have carried you in my head.",
    "In a dream last night I followed where you led",
    "until you asked me in a loud voice what I knew.",
    "(You would have thought it foolish to speak to the dead,",
    "but I was dreaming and could not refuse.) I said",
    "that you were wrong, that I could see your bitter view",
    "(since all this time I have carried you in my head)",
    "for what it was, and you for who you were. Instead",
    "of dreaming your reply I woke as you withdrew.",
    "You would have thought it foolish to speak to the dead",
    "but all this time I have carried you in my head."
