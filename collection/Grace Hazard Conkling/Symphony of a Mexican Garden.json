    "1. THE GARDEN",
    "in A major",
    "The laving tide of inarticulate air.",
    "in A major",
    "The iris people dance.",
    "2. THE POOL",
    "in A minor",
    "Cool-hearted dim familiar of the dove.",
    "3. THE BIRDS",
    "in F major",
    "I keep a frequent tryst.",
    "The blossom-powdered orangeitree.",
    "4. TO THE MOON",
    "in A major",
    "Moon that shone on Babylon.",
    "With flame of the pomegranate tree?",
    "The god of gardens must have made",
    "This still unrumored place for thee",
    "To rest from immortality,",
    "And dream within the splendid shade",
    "Some more elusive symphony",
    "Than orchestra has ever played.",
    "I In A major",
    "The laying tide of inarticulate air",
    "Breaks here in flowers as the sea in foam,",
    "But with no satin lisp of failing wave:",
    "The odor-laden winds are very still.",
    "An unimagined music here exhales",
    "In upcurled petal, dreamy bud half-furled,",
    "And variations of thin vivid leaf:",
    "Symphonic beauty that some god forgot.",
    "If form could waken into lyric sound,",
    "This flock of irises like poising birds",
    "Would feel song at their slender feathered throats,",
    "And pour into a grey-winged aria",
    "Their wrinkled silver fingermarked with pearl;",
    "That flight of ivory roses high along",
    "The airy azure of the larkspur spires",
    "Would be a fugue to puzzle nightingales",
    "With tool-evasive rapture, phrase on phrase.",
    "Where the hibiscus flares would cymbals clash,",
    "And the black cypress like a deep bassoon",
    "Would hum a clouded amber melody.",
    "But all across the trudging ragged chords",
    "That are the tangled grasses in the heat,",
    "The mariposa lilies fluttering",
    "Like trills upon some archangelic flute,",
    "The roses and carnations and divine",
    "Small violets that voice the vanished god,",
    "There is a lure of passion-poignant tone",
    "Not flower-of-pomegranate\u2014that finds the heart",
    "As stubborn oboes do\u2014can breathe in air,",
    "Nor poppies, nor keen lime, nor orange-bloom.",
    "What zone of wonder in the ardent dusk",
    "Of trees that yearn and cannot understand,",
    "Vibrates as to the golden shepherd horn",
    "That stirs some great adagio with its cry",
    "And will not let it rest?",
    "0 tender trees,",
    "Your orchid, like a shepherdess of dreams,",
    "Calls home her whitest dream from following",
    "Elusive laughter of the unmindful god!",
    "The iris people dance",
    "Like any nimble faun:",
    "To rhythmic radiance",
    "They foot it in the dawn.",
    "They dance and have no need",
    "Of crystal-dripping flute",
    "Or chuckling river-reed,\u2014",
    "Their music hovers mute.",
    "The dawn-lights flutter by",
    "All noiseless, but they know!",
    "Such children of the sky",
    "Can hear the darkness go.",
    "But does the morning play",
    "Whatever they demand\u2014",
    "Or amber-barred bourr\u00e9",
    "Or silver saraband?",
    "II. In A minor",
    "Cool-hearted dim familiar of the doves,",
    "Thou coiled sweet water where they come to tell",
    "Their mellow legends and rehearse their loves,",
    "As what in April or in June befell",
    "of, \u2014friend of Dryades",
    "Who lean to see where flower should be set",
    "To star the dusk of wreathed ivy braids,",
    "They have not left thy trees,",
    "Nor do tired fauns thy crystal kiss forget,",
    "Nor forest\u2014nymphs astray from distant glades.",
    "Thou feelest with delight their showery feet",
    "Along thy mossy margin myrtle-starred,",
    "And thine the heart of wildness quick to beat",
    "At imprint of shy hoof upon thy sward:",
    "Yet who could know thee wild who art so cool,",
    "So heavenly\u2014minded, templed in thy grove",
    "Of plumy cedar, larch and juniper?",
    "O strange ecstatic Pool,",
    "What unknown country art thou dreaming of,",
    "Or temple than this garden lovelier?",
    "Who made thy sky the silver side of leaves,",
    "And poised its orchid like a swan\u2014white moon",
    "Whose disc of perfect pallor half deceives",
    "The mirror of thy limpid green lagoon,",
    "He loveth well thy ripple-feathered moods,",
    "Thy whims at dusk, thy rainbow look at dawn!",
    "Dream thou no more of vales Olympian:",
    "Where pale Olympus broods",
    "There were no orchid white as moon or swan,",
    "No sky of leaves, no garden\u2014haunting Pan!",
    "Ill In F major",
    "I keep a frequent tryst",
    "With whirr and shower of wings:",
    "Some inward melodist",
    "Interpreting all things",
    "Appoints the place, the hours.",
    "Dazzle and sense of flowers,",
    "Though not the least leaf stir,",
    "May mean a tanager:",
    "How rich the silence is until he sings!",
    "The smoke-tree\u2019s cloudy white",
    "Has fire within its breast.",
    "What winged mere delight",
    "There hides as in a nest",
    "And fashions of its flame",
    "Music without a name?",
    "So might an opal sing",
    "If given thrilling wing,",
    "And voice for lyric wildness unexpressed.",
    "In grassy dimness thatched",
    "With tangled growing things,",
    "A troubadour rose-patched,",
    "With velvet-shadowed wings,",
    "Seeks a sustaining fly.",
    "Who else unseen goes by",
    "Quick-pattering through the hush?",
    "Some twilight-footed thrush",
    "Or finch intent on small adventurings?",
    "I have no time for gloom,",
    "For gloom what time have I?",
    "The orange is in bloom;",
    "Emerald parrots fly",
    "Out of the cypress-dusk;",
    "Morning is strange with musk.",
    "The wild canary now",
    "Jewels the lemon-bough,",
    "And mocking-birds laugh in the rose\u2019s room.",
    "In D Major",
    "The blossom-powdered orange tree,",
    "For all her royal speechlessness,",
    "Out of a heart of ecstasy",
    "Is singing, singing, none the less!",
    "Light as a springing fountain, she",
    "Is spray above the wind-sleek turf:",
    "Dream-daughter of the moon\u2019s white sea",
    "And sister to its showered surf!",
    "IV In A major",
    "Moon that shone on Babylon,",
    "Searching out the gardens there,",
    "Could you find a fairer one",
    "Than this garden, anywhere?",
    "Did Damascus at her best",
    "Hide such beauty in her breast?",
    "When you flood with creamy light",
    "Vines that net the sombre pine,",
    "Turn the shadowed iris white,",
    "Summon cactus stars to shine,",
    "Do you free in silvered air",
    "Wistful spirits everywhere?",
    "Here they linger, there they pass,",
    "And forget their native heaven:",
    "Flit along the dewy grass",
    "Rare Vittoria, Sappho, even!",
    "And the hushed magnolia burns",
    "Incense in her gleaming urns.",
    "When the nightingale demands",
    "Word with Keats who answers him,",
    "Shakespeare listens\u2014understands\u2014",
    "Mindful of the cherubim;",
    "And the South Wind dreads to know",
    "Mozart gone as seraphs go.",
    "Moon of poets dead and gone,",
    "Moon to gods of music dear,",
    "Gardens they have looked upon",
    "Let them re-discover here:",
    "Rest\u2014and dream a little space",
    "Of some heart-remembered place!"
