    "water water water wind water",
    "across the land shape of a torn heart",
    "new orleans waves come louisiana the waves come",
    "alabama wind calls alabama",
    "and the roofs blow across red clouds",
    "inside the divine spiral",
    "there is a voice",
    "inside the voice there is light",
    "water wind fire smoke the bodies float",
    "and rise",
    "kind flames bow down and move across",
    "the skies never seen blackish red bluish bruised",
    "water rises houses fall the child",
    "the elders the mothers underwater",
    "who will live who will rise",
    "the windows fill with the howling",
    "where is the transfusion where is the lamp",
    "who who in the wet night jagged in the oil",
    "waves come the lakes loosen their sultry shape",
    "it is the shape of a lost hand a wing broken",
    "casinos in biloxi become carnations across the sands",
    "and the woman in the wheelchair descends",
    "her last breath a rose in the razor rain",
    "uptown on mansion hill even the million dollar house bows",
    "in the negative shade someone is afloat",
    "a family dissolves the nation disappears",
    "neighborhoods fade across lost streets the police",
    "dressed in newspapers flutter toward nothingness moons",
    "who goes there",
    "under our floors filtered wooden stars",
    "towels and glass gasoline coffins",
    "the skin of trees and jalopy tires fish",
    "bebop dead from the zoo the dogs half drag",
    "ward number nine miss Symphony Spikes and",
    "mrs. Hardy Johnson the new plankton new",
    "algae of the nameless stroll in the dark ask",
    "the next question about kindness",
    "then there is a bus a taxi a hearse a helicopter",
    "a rescue team a tiny tribe of nine year olds",
    "separating the waters the oils and ashes",
    "hear the song of splinters and blood tree sap",
    "machine oil and old jazz trumpeters z's and x's",
    "raffia skirts and jujube hats and a father man",
    "holds the hand of his lover saying take care of the children",
    "let me go now let me stumble stumble nowhere drink this",
    "earth liquor going in petals",
    "stadiums and looters",
    "celebrities cameras cases more water cases",
    "again and again a new land edge emerges",
    "a new people emerges where race and class and death",
    "and life and water and tears and loss",
    "and life and death destruction and life and tears",
    "compassion and loss and a fire stolen bus",
    "rumbles toward you all directions wherever",
    "you are alive still"
