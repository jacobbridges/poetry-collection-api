    "If what began (look far and wide) will end:",
    "This lava globe huddle and freeze, its core",
    "Brittle with cold, or pulled too near its friend",
    "Pop once like one gun in a long-drawn war,",
    "And the stars sputter one by one, the night",
    "So empty judging",
    "\u2019s out of date",
    "(Space and time gone), then only, height on height,",
    "Mind that impelled those currents and that freight,",
    "Mind that after five days (see those days!",
    "Regions all tropic one day, one all ice!)",
    "Whistled man from the sea-moss, saw him raise",
    "The blundering forepaw, blink from shaggy eyes\u2014",
    "If image, likeness in the ox-yoke brow",
    "Long out of focus, focused mind to Mind\u2014",
    "Ah what unspeakable two and two allows",
    "That silence huddle and all eyes go blind?",
    "Our ups and downs\u2014there! that remembered makes",
    "Memory which is the single mind. How sweet",
    "Carmine stars of the maple fumed in rakes",
    "At 1350 such and such a street.",
    "A thing to keep in mind. Yes and keep yet",
    "When the vile essence violescence lies.",
    "Once in winter by the richening sill",
    "Quiet, the fireplace tiny in our eyes\u2014",
    "I mention this; there\u2019s more. The Almighty will",
    "Aeons late stumble on it with surprise."
