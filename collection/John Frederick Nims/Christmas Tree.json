    "This seablue fir that rode the mountain storm",
    "Is swaddled here in splints of tin to die.",
    "Sofas around in chubby velvet swarm;",
    "Onlooking cabinets glitter with flat eye;",
    "Here lacquer in the branches runs like rain",
    "And resin of treasure starts from every vein.",
    "Light is a dancer here and cannot rest.",
    "No tanagers or jays are half so bright",
    "As swarms of fire that deep in fragrance nest",
    "In jungles of the gilt exotic night",
    "Where melons hang like moonstone. White above",
    "Rises that perfect star, the sign of love.",
    "On carpets\u2019 fairy turf, in rainbow dark,",
    "Here once the enchanted children laid their heads,",
    "Reached for the floating moon above the park,",
    "And all their hopes were simple blues and reds.",
    "Beneath the electric halo, none could see",
    "Swords in the ankle of the victim tree.",
    "Each named a patron star: Arthur said green",
    "For August in the country; and Betty blue",
    "For swinging and the Florida surf; while Jeanne",
    "Decided gold. One horoscope was true:",
    "The star of Donald low and lava-red\u2014",
    "Enlisted Donald, in Australia dead.",
    "Our lives were bound to sorcery and night.",
    "Zodiacs crumble on the boughs of rust",
    "For every child is gone. Some burned too bright",
    "And now lie broken in the bins of dust;",
    "And some, a fortunate few, adventured far",
    "And found assurance in the perfect star."
