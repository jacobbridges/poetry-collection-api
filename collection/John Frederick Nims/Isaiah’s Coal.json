    "Always, he woke in those days",
    "With a sense of treasure,",
    "His heart a gayer glow",
    "Than his window grand with sun,",
    "As a child, its mind all whirring",
    "With green and hollied pleasure",
    "Wakes in a haze of",
    "The season of secrets done.",
    "Or as one on country linen",
    "Wakes with a start one morning\u2014",
    "Then on comfort snugger than pillows",
    "Floats: July at the lake.",
    "Or has married a golden girl",
    "And can hardly believe, but turning",
    "Sees blossom for him that very face",
    "Worshipping cameras take.",
    "Toy trains whirr perky on",
    "Till springs contort beneath;",
    "The middle-age rower slumps",
    "Like a sack\u2014indignant seizure!",
    "Late editions wail",
    "Yet in those same days",
    "He woke with a sense of treasure.",
    "Knowing: my love is safe",
    "Though the Rockies plunge like water,",
    "Though surf like a wildfire rage",
    "And omens roam the sky;",
    "Though limbs of the swimmer laze",
    "Pale where the seaweed caught her,",
    "Nothing can touch my love",
    "As dangerous time goes by."
