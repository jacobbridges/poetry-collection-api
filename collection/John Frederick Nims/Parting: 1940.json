    "Not knowing in what season this again",
    "Not knowing when again the arms outyearning",
    "Nor the flung smile in eyes not knowing when",
    "Not sure beyond all doubt of full return",
    "Not sure of time now nor the film\u2019s reversal",
    "This all done opposite, the waif regathered",
    "Like our lost parents in the blinded song",
    "We bag in hand with wandering steps and slow",
    "Through suburbs take our solitary way",
    "Not that all clouds are garrisoned and stung",
    "Not that horizons loom with coppered legions",
    "Not that the year is dark with weird condition",
    "All who parted in all days looked back",
    "Saw the white face, the waving. And saw the sea",
    "Not knowing in what season this again",
    "For well they knew, the parters in all evenings",
    "Druid and Roman and the rocked Phoenician:",
    "The blood flows one imposed way, and no other"
