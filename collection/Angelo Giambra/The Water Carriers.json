    "On hot days we would see them",
    "leaving the hive in swarms. June and I",
    "would watch them weave their way",
    "through the sugarberry trees toward the pond",
    "where they would stop to take a drink,",
    "then buzz their way back, plump and full of water,",
    "to drop it on the backs of the fanning bees.",
    "If you listened you could hear them, their tiny wings",
    "beating in unison as they cooled down the hive.",
    "My brother caught one once, its bulbous body",
    "bursting with water, beating itself against",
    "the smooth glass wall of the canning jar.",
    "He lit a match, dropped it in, but nothing",
    "happened. The match went out and the bee",
    "swam through the mix of sulfur and smoke",
    "until my brother let it out. It flew straight",
    "back to the hive. Later, we skinny-dipped",
    "in the pond, the three of us, the August sun",
    "melting the world around us as if it were",
    "wax. In the cool of the evening, we walked",
    "home, pond water still dripping from our skin,",
    "glistening and twinkling like starlight.\ufeff"
