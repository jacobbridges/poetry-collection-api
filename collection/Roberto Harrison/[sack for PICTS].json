    "i make signs everywhere, with sticks, stones and leaves",
    "for those in the clouds from below the line to arrive",
    "i don\u2019t have a language to speak to you with, my tongues are all fish",
    "i know that a one is a circle, and that nothing is round,",
    "except every corner i saw by the hearts",
    "lined up on the spine",
    "i know that the winter will finally be here again, and that the summer",
    "will die and be born with its ice",
    "i unravel the token you gave me for freedom, i bury the flags in your eyes",
    "under each Arabic sign. . . 1,2,3, on and on. . . and before",
    "i varnish again all the battle grounds freed to travel the face of 2 yews",
    "i remake every button with children put down by 5 tons of your crosses",
    "i am flaking with crust at the dangling ushers they fall for light signs",
    "i make my car shake with my fear, the headlights are showing me songs",
    "by the road for the now disappeared, shots crack by the ones that",
    "remain",
    "i can tell by your lies and your pride that your heart is as small as your pupils",
    "opening up for your strokes",
    "and getting smaller for light",
    "i am the siphon that gravity fills up the blanks in your face with",
    "i sing a throat full of",
    ", for the safety releases that shots spill for you",
    "i salivate for your spiraling warmth, in the morning when i collapse, over and over",
    "i have all our love letters taped to the ceiling, my sleep is the end of our flies",
    "their warbles keep rolling",
    "i double the maps on your roads",
    "i put a slab of meat on your cheeks",
    "i thaw every word that pours ends through your blood",
    "i turn in the hair that your father hung with, erasers ring mountains for more",
    "i pick up a chair for the lightning, satellites put out a bead",
    "i bleed in the real that you see with a shine, pieces of chicken pile up to count nukes",
    "i tear off the rain, and cut its numerical age into passing truck tombs",
    "i force your faces to mine, and bother your ebony whirls to circle the holes in the sky",
    "i fire electrons to make your promise discard its word, and fall through",
    "i tie miseries to drains, and pay off my debt with suns",
    "i am more cruel than a counter",
    "i pick a safe with your words, until my distance is short",
    "i slap at your monthly returns, and tie your animals to 5 dirt seas",
    "i ride through your roads in the glass, and steal tiny cracks",
    "i blame the small stone hid in my colorless mouth, and pin rags to your lips",
    "i volunteer for your wars, and lose them all",
    "i borrow your daydreams, and purse up their gardens, into our hands",
    "i pulse with you standing by rocks",
    "i say all you said by the iron door",
    "i throw kites in the room where they found me",
    "i sell off inseparable fingers",
    "i throw windows to walls",
    "i whispers hard rings into telephones, and scratch at the bed",
    "i fade into water",
    "i remember the hands",
    "i open holes through barbed houses",
    "i blow darts through your tunnels and doors",
    "i pile roofs through our wounds",
    "i move through your runs and your screens",
    "i see the news in the sand",
    "i digit up noontimes",
    "i peel off my skins with old sounds",
    "i walk through the valley of lead",
    "i unplug your pages of light",
    "i frost over programs and ride 3 roads on 5 deer"
