    "i fail in the retry of possible gaps",
    "for the middle of canyons",
    "in crumbling lights",
    "for the scarification of vinyl.",
    "it rides through the forest",
    "and throbs a small packet",
    "where parallel seams",
    "scratch a readable surface",
    "on the backs of the camels",
    "in mirages of separate planes",
    "to the bursting eclipse",
    "of pronounceable service,",
    "two spots on its forehead call out",
    "for the country of doubling masses",
    "on a highway that cuts into faces",
    "in line for the city",
    "every stream ties a knot",
    "for an opening under the sea",
    "i lose all my digits",
    "to the moon that will one day be bare",
    "to the parched piles of breathing in farms",
    "to the doorways that promise a morning",
    "on the accident prone to a murder of chance",
    "every mouse in the dust in the kitchen",
    "will harvest the cold",
    "in the sickness of scattering twigs",
    "in the answer of mirrors",
    "for the double that sings with the night",
    "by the prayer full of ashes",
    "under frozen cadavers that once",
    "were the hearts",
    "in the egg of a wound",
    "i disappear in the wrap-up",
    "for invisible letters that leave all the snow",
    "for the hunt to deliver migration",
    "on the mushroom fields full of returns",
    "under beaches in roads by a promise",
    "where the water turns into a home",
    "and the blame of the air will no longer wail",
    "for the spot in the cloud full of planets",
    "while a bubble reenters a womb",
    "for explosions in placards",
    "like the front of a bus",
    "crossing vines in a prairie",
    "that were traced on the skin of a goat",
    "i look at the picture of too many races",
    "for the blood of a horse",
    "that a bundle of sleeping",
    "3 shorted connections",
    "for the change of electrical chairs",
    "under pools of announcements",
    "for the battling showers",
    "that tell all the stories of war",
    "to infants in sight of the corner of trading",
    "for the telephones buried in answers",
    "under barrooms and sawdust and piers",
    "where the songs of an isthmus",
    "circle the beacon",
    "where the moon cannot pull",
    "where a whisper",
    "moves sand off a stone",
    "i weigh every mote in my eye with the fingers of handshakes",
    "they calibrate walks like the wheels of a car",
    "they reflect in a wave",
    "like untying the knot of a bruise full of ice",
    "where once was a number",
    "where the count was eleven",
    "where equality lifts",
    "like the dough",
    "that incarcerates mud clots and showers",
    "for the vanishing thorn",
    "in a guide by the pillow",
    "softly omitted",
    "what the second hand sees",
    "under gears by the hand of a cripple",
    "for the ditch in a face that is fine",
    "i bury my head in the leaves",
    "that the buses were lost in",
    "that day when i looked for her here in the Arctic",
    "when the telephone poles were the marks of equators",
    "when the mornings at home",
    "could not write their own name",
    "when the shepherd was singing too many shields",
    "at the entrance of staring at stars in the basement",
    "with the light in the chest of what follows",
    "with a walking that pulls at two seals",
    "for the trouble in words",
    "in the empty",
    "in the on and off one",
    "why there have to be zeros",
    "to raise all the shores",
    "for",
    "to line themselves up in the snow",
    "under spreading the phase",
    "of recalling the crosshairs",
    "on the hive",
    "that the singing will never return",
    "when the breaking gives others",
    "a prompt to give air",
    "i radio frequencies meant to undress all the parrots",
    "in the knot that a hill on the head",
    "of the viewer can see",
    "without even a monkey to grow",
    "with a molecule\u2019s power",
    "in a black hole instead of a screen",
    "in identity swimming to surface",
    "every outlook reframes on a break",
    "in circular lots",
    "by the parking spot full of directions",
    "where a jacket sinks into the roll",
    "of an orange in Fez",
    "around trains in the mountains",
    "that the pantomime echoes",
    "in the valley of shells that call out",
    "for an engine to answer",
    "when penalties cease in the skull",
    "of another score gone on the pavement",
    "with the sound of a bell that is broken",
    "to bear its first weight in the sand"
