    "O patient shore, that canst not go to meet",
    "Thy love, the restless sea, how comfortest",
    "Thou all thy loneliness? Art thou at rest,",
    "When, loosing his strong arms from round thy feet,",
    "He turns away? Know\u2019st thou, however sweet",
    "That other shore may be, that to thy breast",
    "He must return? And when in sterner test",
    "He folds thee to a heart which does not beat,",
    "Wraps thee in ice, and gives no smile, no kiss,",
    "To break long wintry days, still dost thou miss",
    "Naught from thy trust? Still, wait, unfaltering,",
    "The higher, warmer waves which leap in spring?",
    "O sweet, wise shore, to be so satisfied!",
    "O heart, learn from the shore! Love has a tide!"
