    "I do not know if, climbing some steep hill,",
    "Through fragrant wooded pass, this glimpse I bought,",
    "Or whether in some mid-day I was caught",
    "To upper air, where visions of God\u2019s will",
    "In pictures to our quickened sense fulfil",
    "His word. But this I saw.",
    "A path I sought",
    "Through wall of rock. No human fingers wrought",
    "The golden gates which opened sudden, still,",
    "And wide. My fear was hushed by my delight.",
    "Surpassing fair the lands; my path lay plain;",
    "Alas, so spell-bound, feasting on the sight,",
    "I paused, that I but reached the threshold bright,",
    "When, swinging swift, the golden gates again",
    "Were rocky wall, by which I wept in vain."
