    "It seems like I'm growing more and more like a clown. First of all, I'm always",
    "sad. Secondly, all my knives are made out of rubber. Thirdly, it's like my house",
    "is on fire.",
    "No, I'm definitely becoming more like a clown. I have a tendency to want to put",
    "on clown clothes. As soon as I put the clown clothes on I feel faintly happier...",
    "Another sign is that I constantly feel like I'm alone in a dressing room. Most",
    "of the time I feel amused. Anyway, the only thing good about the circus is",
    "the tigers.",
    "I realize that I could get both legs cut off by the circus train or get frightened",
    "by an elephant. But it's very depressing to sit around in a clown suit and think",
    "about death.",
    "Sometimes I don't feel happy unless I'm in my clown suit. And I enjoy hitting",
    "people on the head with a foam club. I really do...",
    "When people see me they realize that it looks very sophisticated to wear a clown",
    "suit and smoke a cigarette. This is how I get all the ladies because they think I'm",
    "very droll.",
    "People don't understand how you turn into a clown. You turn into a clown",
    "because you feel more and more like putting on a clown suit. When you're",
    "around people you sense a kindliness. It makes you so nervous you can't",
    "stay calm. Which is why it feels perfectly normal to wear orange pants.",
    "Plus, it's very subversive to wear bow ties. You can't imagine how jolly",
    "everything is. And the fright wigs... I don't want to be a clown but I'm",
    "sure to be one. My mother was a clown."
