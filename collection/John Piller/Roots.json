    "It's easy to believe you can go back",
    "Whenever you desire, jump in the car",
    "And drive, arrive at dusk\u2014the hour",
    "You recall most vividly\u2014and walk",
    "Among the buildings spread across the farm,",
    "Out toward the pastures, woods, and fields.",
    "There is music in the leaves, in the dense",
    "Columns of green corn. The wind lays down",
    "The tune. You can play it, too, simply",
    "By walking with eyes closed, arms",
    "Stretched out, lightly striking the stalks.",
    "Who wouldn't desire, like the children",
    "Lost in so many similar fields,",
    "To sit down on the turned earth and drift",
    "Away on the rhythms of his own",
    "First possible death? Rescuing",
    "Voices come closer, veer off. Flashlight beams",
    "Strobe over your head. You do not care.",
    "Each building you remember\u2014hen house,",
    "Sheep shed, corn crib, barn\u2014caved in upon itself,",
    "The walls and roofs collapsing with a final",
    "Percussive clap, since you last walked those fields.",
    "No one you will ever know works that land now.",
    "It is as green as Eden. Life rises in the roots, in the leaves."
