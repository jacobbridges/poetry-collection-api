    "We buy what we cannot control, the rugs,",
    "rhythm-makers, containing refrains of",
    "the oldest story: a man takes a journey.",
    "I have no stories inside me, he says,",
    "so travels on, to rest beneath a carpet",
    "of blue constellations, star patterns",
    "at the edges of disordered border walls.",
    "At the center, a meditative medallion",
    "makes a moving immortal-flowered ground:",
    "to live there is to give oneself over",
    "to greenness, redness, occasional blues,",
    "holding those spirits of woollen dyes",
    "rising from the knots within to breathe",
    "against the woven, multi-colored air.",
    "[BIDJAR]",
    "Now there is a coat of many colors hung",
    "around the wanderer's shoulders where",
    "he climbs out from that pit, down which",
    "he flung himself, or was thrown into.",
    "Reaching to soothe his wounds, he finds",
    "the dusts of centuries residing there",
    "beneath his feet, the hopeful travelers",
    "passing, wearing thin, fighting about",
    "how best to articulate the names of gods",
    "for whom they yearn\u2014accursed by wars'",
    "helmet curves, shields, chained stitches",
    "of unmediated reds and yellowed husks",
    "of blood\u2014broken lines marking a garden",
    "in whose precincts his journey began.",
    "[KAZAK]",
    "Three sunbursts spin, enigmatic energies",
    "through golden latchhooks, surrounding",
    "cloudbanks; three eagles, darting within",
    "their shifting images: they return him",
    "to streets of lit porches in summer dark,",
    "a boy stuttering over random syllables,",
    "a blindfolded man pleading for his life\u2014",
    "whose fate is in the hands of some men",
    "whose fate is in the hands of other men,",
    "whose fate . . . until the whole pattern",
    "emerges, and the language becomes clear.",
    "On the floor lies his mother, moaning,",
    "until he comes out, guilty, before her\u2014",
    "amid the mud of his own frozen blood.",
    "[SHIRVAN]",
    "To live inside such squares as the weaver",
    "of this green, becoming golden, labor;",
    "to pull back old skins and try to emerge,",
    "victorious, from that old prison after",
    "so many years, is to find a path back to",
    "harmonious designs, surely centered on",
    "the search\u2014yet still speaking of a life",
    "with knotted figures seen as suffering",
    "variations on themes that can be inferred",
    "from small vibrations of weft and warp,",
    "the \u2018snakes' within the threads worn down",
    "to the shapes of ribbons, even rhythms",
    "writhing in a loom of days: those humming",
    "ancient instruments whose music seems",
    "[SHIRAZ]",
    "raw as colors governed by the earth, pink",
    "as brick, or deserts scraped from rock,",
    "rough clay slowly grinding, then drifting",
    "down the slopes of the central plateaus",
    "to fresh respites from thinner regions of",
    "dessication fixed at the fringes below.",
    "These lands lie under the ache of desire,",
    "which calls feet out to play upon sand,",
    "to fill each new hollow, and dance about,",
    "tongues turning on the knots of umber,",
    "ochre, woven into those undulating waves",
    "others might summon in flowery manners",
    "to escape from bitter orange, still held",
    "by recalcitrant fingers, to the purple",
    "[KERMAN]",
    "empowering all those who try to hold on\u2014",
    "as all things will hold to themselves",
    "an idea of themselves\u2014to an aspiration",
    "towards good fortune, unwavering even",
    "unto death. Yet here are dusky passages,",
    "canopies of clearness, an everlasting",
    "understanding of the earth as cancerous",
    "points of coloration, acid starbursts,",
    "or dangerous blots\u2014all blurring the way",
    "to move past sight: perspectives lost",
    "and found again, symmetrical, surrounded",
    "by the momentos one saves from travel,",
    "old friends, like hues that may betoken,",
    "in hopefulness, some changes of heart.",
    "[SENNEH]",
    "This creates a powerful language about",
    "how to levitate a plane\u2014for even as",
    "the occasional murmurs of new machines",
    "are heard in the land, as old cyclic",
    "gardens arrange themselves in the whorls",
    "and tendrils throughout tilled fields,",
    "snakes hold up this world in variations",
    "of light blue skies above temptation.",
    "Even when an illiterate weaver mistakes",
    "an old date for the design, then dyes",
    "and binds strange numbers into a ground,",
    "the change of the serif, for instance,",
    "in a calligraphy of days marks the date",
    "of cartouches as mysterious, unknown.",
    "[KASHAN]",
    "Yet the signals from the borders suggest",
    "a different tale: lozenges are bottles",
    "strewn along mauve and terra cotta roads,",
    "shaped like a woman found lying along",
    "the side of those same roads\u2014the figure",
    "of flesh, going nowhere but endlessly",
    "back on itself\u2014as a web of years frames",
    "a dying kind of certitude, innocence.",
    "The birds in these cages signify singing,",
    "as the tapestries of perfected threads",
    "suggest reticence, chosen intermediaries",
    "to the indeterminancy of all creation:",
    "and we can buy it yet, articulate or not,",
    "with each new freeing of our hearts."
