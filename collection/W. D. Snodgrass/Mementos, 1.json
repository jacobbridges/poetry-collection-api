    "picture. I stopped there cold,",

    "Still, that first second, I was glad: you stand",
    "Just as you stood\u2014shy, delicate, slender,",

    "Us all. Well, our needs were different, then,",
    "And our ideals came easy.",
    "Then through the war and those two long years",
    "Overseas, the Japanese dead in their shacks",
    "Among dishes, dolls, and lost shoes; I carried",
    "This glimpse of you, there, to choke down my fear,",
    "Prove it had been, that it might come back.",
    "That was before we got married.",

    "With lies, self-denial, unspoken regret",
    "And the sick eyes that blame; before the divorce",
    "And the treachery. Say it: before we met. Still,",
    "I put back your picture. Someday, in due course,",
    "I will find that it\u2019s still there."
