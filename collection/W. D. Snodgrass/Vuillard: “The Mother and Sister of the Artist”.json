    "Admire, when you come here, the glimmering hair",
    "Of the girl; praise her pale",
    "Complexion. Think well of her dress",
    "Though that is somewhat out of fashion.",
    "Don\u2019t try to take her hand, but smile for",
    "Her hesitant gentleness.",
    "Say the old woman is looking strong",
    "Today; such hardiness. Remark,",
    "Perhaps, how she has dressed herself black",
    "Like a priest, and wears that sufficient air",
    "That does become the righteous.",
    "As you approach, she will push back",
    "Her chair, shove away her plate",
    "And wait,",
    "Sitting squat and direct, before",
    "The red mahogany chest",
    "Massive as some great",
    "Safe; will wait,",
    "By the table and her greasy plate,",
    "The bone half-chewed, her wine half-drained;",
    "She will wait. And fix her steady",
    "Eyes on you\u2014the straight stare",
    "Of an old politician.",
    "Try once to meet her eyes. But fail.",
    "Let your sight",
    "Drift\u2014yet never as if hunting for",
    "The keys (you keep imagining) hung",
    "By her belt. (They are not there.)",
    "Watch, perhaps, that massive chest\u2014the way",
    "It tries to lean",
    "Forward, toward her, till it seems to rest",
    "Its whole household\u2019s weight",
    "Of linens and clothing and provisions",
    "All on her stiff back.",
    "It might be strapped there like the monstrous pack",
    "Of some enchanted pedlar. Dense, self-contained,",
    "Like mercury in a ball,",
    "She can support this without strain,",
    "Yet she grows smaller, wrinkling",
    "Like a potato, parched as dung;",
    "It cramps her like a fist.",
    "Ask no one why the chest",
    "Has no knobs. Betray",
    "No least suspicion",
    "The necessities within",
    "Could vanish at her",
    "Will. Try not to think",
    "That as she feeds, gains",
    "Specific gravity,",
    "She shrinks, light-",
    "less as the world\u2019s",
    "Hard core",
    "And the per-",
    "spective drains",
    "In her.",
    "Finally, above all,",
    "You must not ever see,",
    "Or let slip one hint you can see,",
    "On the other side, the girl\u2019s",
    "Cuffs, like cordovan restraints;",
    "Forget her bony, tentative wrist,",
    "The half-fed, worrying eyes, and how",
    "She backs out, bows, and tries to bow",
    "Out of the scene, grows too ethereal",
    "To make a shape inside her dress",
    "And the dress itself is beginning already",
    "To sublime itself away like a vapor",
    "That merges into the empty twinkling",
    "Of the air and of the bright wallpaper."
