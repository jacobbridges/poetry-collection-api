    "\u2014AFTER THE MIDDLE-IRISH ROMANCE, THE MADNESS OF SUIBHNE",
    "1",
    "Child of my winter, born",
    "When the new fallen soldiers froze",
    "In Asia\u2019s steep ravines and fouled the snows,",
    "When I was torn",
    "By love I could not still,",
    "By fear that silenced my cramped mind",
    "To that cold war where, lost, I could not find",
    "My peace in my will,",
    "All those days we could keep",
    "Your mind a landscape of new snow",
    "Where the chilled tenant-farmer finds, below,",
    "His fields asleep",
    "In their smooth covering, white",
    "As quilts to warm the resting bed",
    "Of birth or pain, spotless as paper spread",
    "For me to write,",
    "And thinks: Here lies my land",
    "Unmarked by agony, the lean foot",
    "Of the weasel tracking, the thick trapper\u2019s boot;",
    "And I have planned",
    "My chances to restrain",
    "The torments of demented summer or",
    "Increase the deepening harvest here before",
    "It snows again.",
    "2",
    "Late April and you are three; today",
    "We dug your garden in the yard.",
    "To curb the damage of your play,",
    "Strange dogs at night and the moles tunneling,",
    "Four slender sticks of lath stand guard",
    "Uplifting their thin string.",
    "So you were the first to tramp it down.",
    "And after the earth was sifted close",
    "You brought your watering can to drown",
    "All earth",
    "us. But these mixed seeds are pressed",
    "With light loam in their steadfast rows.",
    "Child, we\u2019ve done our best.",
    "Someone will have to weed and spread",
    "The young sprouts. Sprinkle them in the hour",
    "When shadow falls across their bed.",
    "You should try to look at them every day",
    "Because when they come to full flower",
    "I will be away.",
    "3",
    "The child between them on the street",
    "Comes to a puddle, lifts his feet",
    "And hangs on their hands. They start",
    "At the live weight and lurch together,",
    "Recoil to swing him through the weather,",
    "Stiffen and pull apart.",
    "We read of cold war soldiers that",
    "Never gained ground, gave none, but sat",
    "Tight in their chill trenches.",
    "Pain seeps up from some cavity",
    "Through the ranked teeth in sympathy;",
    "The whole jaw grinds and clenches",
    "Till something somewhere has to give.",
    "It\u2019s better the poor soldiers live",
    "In someone else\u2019s hands",
    "Than drop where helpless powers fall",
    "On crops and barns, on towns where all",
    "Will burn. And no man stands.",
    "For good, they sever and divide",
    "Their won and lost land. On each side",
    "Prisoners are returned",
    "Excepting a few unknown names.",
    "The peasant plods back and reclaims",
    "His fields that strangers burned",
    "And nobody seems very pleased.",
    "It\u2019s best. Still, what must not be seized",
    "Clenches the empty fist.",
    "I tugged your hand, once, when I hated",
    "Things less: a mere game dislocated",
    "The radius of your wrist.",
    "Love\u2019s wishbone, child, although I\u2019ve gone",
    "As men must and let you be drawn",
    "Off to appease another,",
    "It may help that a Chinese play",
    "Or Solomon himself might say",
    "I am your real mother.",
    "4",
    "No one can tell you why",
    "the season will not wait;",
    "the night I told you I",
    "must leave, you wept a fearful rate",
    "to stay up late.",
    "Now that it\u2019s turning Fall,",
    "we go to take our walk",
    "among municipal",
    "flowers, to steal one off its stalk,",
    "to try and talk.",
    "We huff like windy giants",
    "scattering with our breath",
    "gray-headed dandelions;",
    "Spring is the cold wind's aftermath.",
    "The poet saith.",
    "But the asters, too, are gray,",
    "ghost-gray. Last night\u2019s cold",
    "is sending on their way",
    "petunias and dwarf marigold,",
    "hunched sick and old.",
    "Like nerves caught in a graph,",
    "the morning-glory vines",
    "frost has erased by half",
    "still scrawl across their rigid twines.",
    "Like broken lines",
    "of verses I can\u2019t make.",
    "In its unraveling loom",
    "we find a flower to take,",
    "with some late buds that might still bloom,",
    "back to your room.",
    "Night comes and the stiff dew.",
    "I\u2019m told a friend\u2019s child cried",
    "because a cricket, who",
    "had minstreled every night outside",
    "her window, died.",
    "5",
    "Winter again and it is snowing;",
    "Although you are still three,",
    "You are already growing",
    "Strange to me.",
    "You chatter about new playmates, sing",
    "Strange songs; you do not know",
    "Or where I go",
    "Or when I sang for bedtime,",
    "Before I went for walks",
    "And did not write;",
    "You never mind the squalls and storms",
    "That are renewed long since;",
    "Outside the thick snow swarms",
    "Into my prints",
    "And swirls out by warehouses, sealed,",
    "Dark cowbarns, huddled, still,",
    "Beyond to the blank field,",
    "The fox\u2019s hill",
    "Where he backtracks and sees the paw,",
    "Gnawed off, he cannot feel;",
    "Conceded to the jaw",
    "Of toothed, blue steel.",
    "6",
    "Easter has come around",
    "again; the river is rising",
    "over the thawed ground",
    "and the banksides. When you come you bring",
    "an egg dyed lavender.",
    "We shout along our bank to hear",
    "our voices returning from the hills to meet us.",
    "We need the landscape to repeat us.",
    "You lived on this bank first.",
    "While nine months filled your term, we knew",
    "how your lungs, immersed",
    "in the womb, miraculously grew",
    "their useless folds till",
    "the fierce, cold air rushed in to fill",
    "them out like bushes thick with leaves. You took your hour,",
    "caught breath, and cried with your full lung power.",
    "Over the stagnant bight",
    "we see the hungry bank swallow",
    "flaunting his free flight",
    "still; we sink in mud to follow",
    "the killdeer from the grass",
    "that hides her nest. That March there was",
    "rain; the rivers rose; you could hear killdeers flying",
    "all night over the mudflats crying.",
    "You bring back how the red-",
    "winged blackbird shrieked, slapping frail wings,",
    "diving at my head\u2014",
    "I saw where her tough nest, cradled, swings",
    "in tall reeds that must sway",
    "with the winds blowing every way.",
    "If you recall much, you recall this place. You still",
    "live nearby\u2014on the opposite hill.",
    "After the sharp windstorm",
    "of July Fourth, all that summer",
    "through the gentle, warm",
    "afternoons, we heard great chain saws chirr",
    "like iron locusts. Crews",
    "of roughneck boys swarmed to cut loose",
    "branches wrenched in the shattering wind, to hack free",
    "all the torn limbs that could sap the tree.",
    "In the debris lay",
    "starlings, dead. Near the park\u2019s birdrun",
    "we surprised one day",
    "a proud, tan-spatted, buff-brown pigeon.",
    "In my hands she flapped so",
    "fearfully that I let her go.",
    "Her keeper came. And we helped snarl her in a net.",
    "You bring things I\u2019d as soon forget.",
    "You raise into my head",
    "a Fall night that I came once more",
    "to sit on your bed;",
    "sweat beads stood out on your arms and fore-",
    "head and you wheezed for breath,",
    "for help, like some child caught beneath",
    "its comfortable woolly blankets, drowning there.",
    "Your lungs caught and would not take the air.",
    "Of all things, only we",
    "have power to choose that we should die;",
    "nothing else is free",
    "in this world to refuse it. Yet I,",
    "who say this, could not raise",
    "myself from bed how many days",
    "to the thieving world. Child, I have another wife,",
    "another child. We try to choose our life.",
    "7",
    "Here in the scuffled dust",
    "is our ground of play.",
    "I lift you on your swing and must",
    "shove you away,",
    "see you return again,",
    "drive you off again, then",
    "stand quiet till you come.",
    "You, though you climb",
    "higher, farther from me, longer,",
    "will fall back to me stronger.",
    "Bad penny, pendulum,",
    "you keep my constant time",
    "to bob in blue July",
    "where fat goldfinches fly",
    "over the glittering, fecund",
    "reach of our growing lands.",
    "Once more now, this second,",
    "I hold you in my hands.",
    "8",
    "I thumped on you the best I could",
    "which was no use;",
    "you would not tolerate your food",
    "until the sweet, fresh milk was soured",
    "with lemon juice.",
    "That puffed you up like a fine yeast.",
    "The first June in your yard",
    "like some squat Nero at a feast",
    "you sat and chewed on white, sweet clover.",
    "That is over.",
    "When you were old enough to walk",
    "we went to feed",
    "the rabbits in the park milkweed;",
    "saw the paired monkeys, under lock,",
    "consume each other's salt.",
    "Going home we watched the slow",
    "stars follow us down Heaven\u2019s vault.",
    "You said, let\u2019s catch one that comes low,",
    "pull off its skin",
    "and cook it for our dinner.",
    "As absentee bread-winner,",
    "I seldom got you such cuisine;",
    "we ate in local restaurants",
    "or bought what lunches we could pack",
    "in a brown sack",
    "with stale, dry bread to toss for ducks",
    "on the green-scummed lagoons,",
    "crackers for porcupine and fox,",
    "life-savers for the footpad coons",
    "to scour and rinse,",
    "snatch after in their muddy pail",
    "and stare into their paws.",
    "When I moved next door to the jail",
    "I learned to fry",
    "omelettes and griddlecakes so I",
    "could set you supper at my table.",
    "As I built back from helplessness,",
    "when I grew able,",
    "the only possible answer was",
    "you had to come here less.",
    "This Hallowe\u2019en you come one week.",
    "You masquerade",
    "as a vermilion, sleek,",
    "fat, crosseyed fox in the parade",
    "or, where grim jackolanterns leer,",
    "go with your bag from door to door",
    "foraging for treats. How queer:",
    "when you take off your mask",
    "my neighbors must forget and ask",
    "whose child you are.",
    "Of course you lose your appetite,",
    "whine and won\u2019t touch your plate;",
    "as local law",
    "I set your place on an orange crate",
    "in your own room for days. At night",
    "you lie asleep there on the bed",
    "and grate your jaw.",
    "Assuredly your father\u2019s crimes",
    "are visited",
    "on you. You visit me sometimes.",
    "The time\u2019s up. Now our pumpkin sees",
    "me bringing your suitcase.",
    "He holds his grin;",
    "the forehead shrivels, sinking in.",
    "You break this year\u2019s first crust of snow",
    "off the runningboard to eat.",
    "We manage, though for days",
    "I crave sweets when you leave and know",
    "they rot my teeth. Indeed our sweet",
    "foods leave us cavities.",
    "9",
    "I get numb and go in",
    "though the dry ground will not hold",
    "the few dry swirls of snow",
    "and it must not be very cold.",
    "A friend asks how you\u2019ve been",
    "and I don\u2019t know",
    "or see much right to ask.",
    "Or what use it could be to know.",
    "In three months since you came",
    "the leaves have fallen and the snow;",
    "your pictures pinned above my desk",
    "seem much the same.",
    "Somehow I come to find",
    "myself upstairs in the third floor",
    "museum\u2019s halls,",
    "walking to kill my time once more",
    "among the enduring and resigned",
    "stuffed animals,",
    "where, through a century\u2019s",
    "caprice, displacement and",
    "known treachery between",
    "its wars, they hear some old command",
    "and in their peaceable kingdoms freeze",
    "to this still scene,",
    ". Here",
    "by the door, its guardian,",
    "the patchwork dodo stands",
    "where you and your stepsister ran",
    "laughing and pointing. Here, last year,",
    "you pulled my hands",
    "and had your first, worst quarrel,",
    "so toys were put up on your shelves.",
    "Here in the first glass cage",
    "the little bobcats arch themselves,",
    "still practicing their snarl",
    "of constant rage.",
    "The bison, here, immense,",
    "shoves at his calf, brow to brow,",
    "and looks it in the eye",
    "to see what is it thinking now.",
    "I forced you to obedience;",
    "I don\u2019t know why.",
    "Still the lean lioness",
    "beyond them, on her jutting ledge",
    "of shale and desert shrub,",
    "stands watching always at the edge,",
    "stands hard and tanned and envious",
    "above her cub;",
    "with horns locked in tall heather,",
    "two great Olympian Elk stand bound,",
    "fixed in their lasting hate",
    "till hunger brings them both to ground.",
    "Whom equal weakness binds together",
    "none shall separate.",
    "Yet separate in the ocean",
    "of broken ice, the white bear reels",
    "beyond the leathery groups",
    "of scattered, drab Arctic seals",
    "arrested here in violent motion",
    "like Napoleon\u2019s troops.",
    "Our states have stood so long",
    "at war, shaken with hate and dread,",
    "they are paralyzed at bay;",
    "once we were out of reach, we said,",
    "we would grow reasonable and strong.",
    "Some other day.",
    "Like the cold men of Rome,",
    "we have won costly fields to sow",
    "in salt, our only seed.",
    "Nothing but injury will grow.",
    "I write you only the bitter poems",
    "that you can\u2019t read.",
    "Onan who would not breed",
    "a child to take his brother\u2019s bread",
    "and be his brother\u2019s birth,",
    "rose up and left his lawful bed,",
    "went out and spilled his seed",
    "in the cold earth.",
    "I stand by the unborn,",
    "by putty-colored children curled",
    "in jars of alcohol,",
    "that waken to no other world,",
    "unchanging, where no eye shall mourn.",
    "I see the caul",
    "that wrapped a kitten, dead.",
    "I see the branching, doubled throat",
    "of a two-headed foal;",
    "I see the hydrocephalic goat;",
    "here is the curled and swollen head,",
    "there, the burst skull;",
    "skin of a limbless calf;",
    "a horse\u2019s foetus, mummified;",
    "mounted and joined forever,",
    "the Siamese twin dogs that ride",
    "belly to belly, half and half,",
    "that none shall sever.",
    "I walk among the growths,",
    "by gangrenous tissue, goiter, cysts,",
    "by fistulas and cancers,",
    "where the malignancy man loathes",
    "is held suspended and persists.",
    "And I don\u2019t know the answers.",
    "The window\u2019s turning white.",
    "The world moves like a diseased heart",
    "packed with ice and snow.",
    "Three months now we have been apart",
    "less than a mile. I cannot fight",
    "or let you go.",
    "10",
    "The vicious winter finally yields",
    "the green winter wheat;",
    "the farmer, tired in the tired fields",
    "he dare not leave, will eat.",
    "Once more the runs come fresh; prevailing",
    "piglets, stout as jugs,",
    "harry their old sow to the railing",
    "to ease her swollen dugs",
    "and game colts trail the herded mares",
    "that circle the pasture courses;",
    "our seasons bring us back once more",
    "like merry-go-round horses.",
    "With crocus mouths, perennial hungers,",
    "into the park Spring comes;",
    "we roast hot dogs on old coat hangers",
    "and feed the swan bread crumbs,",
    "pay our respects to the peacocks, rabbits,",
    "and leathery Canada goose",
    "who took, last Fall, our tame white habits",
    "and now will not turn loose.",
    "In full regalia, the pheasant cocks",
    "march past their dubious hens;",
    "the porcupine and the lean, red fox",
    "trot around bachelor pens",
    "and the miniature painted train",
    "wails on its oval track:",
    "you said, I\u2019m going to Pennsylvania!",
    "and waved. And you\u2019ve come back.",
    "If I loved you, they said I\u2019d leave",
    "and find my own affairs.",
    "Well, once again this April, we\u2019ve",
    "come around to the bears;",
    "punished and cared for, behind bars,",
    "the coons on bread and water",
    "stretch thin black fingers after ours.",
    "And you are still my daughter."
