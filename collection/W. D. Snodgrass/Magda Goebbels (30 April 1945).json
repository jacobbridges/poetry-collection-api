    "This is the needle that we give",
    "Soldiers and children when they live",
    "Near the front in primitive",
    "Conditions or real dangers;",
    "This is the spoon we use to feed",
    "Men trapped in trouble or in need,",
    "When weakness or bad luck might lead",
    "Them to the hands of strangers.",
    "This is the room where you can sleep",
    "Your sleep out, curled up under deep",
    "Layers of covering that will keep",
    "You safe till all harm\u2019s past.",
    "This is the bed where you can rest",
    "In perfect silence, undistressed",
    "By noise or nightmares, as my breast",
    "Once held you soft but fast.",
    "This is the Doctor who has brought",
    "Your needle with your special shot",
    "To quiet you; you won\u2019t get caught",
    "Off guard or unprepared.",
    "I am your nurse who\u2019ll comfort you;",
    "I nursed you, fed you till you grew",
    "Too big to feed; now you\u2019re all through",
    "Fretting or feeling scared.",
    "This is the glass tube that contains",
    "Calm that will spread down through your veins",
    "To free you finally from all pains",
    "Of going on in error.",
    "This tiny pinprick sets the germ",
    "Inside you that fills out its term",
    "Till you can feel yourself grow firm",
    "Against all doubt, all terror.",
    "Into this spoon I break the pill",
    "That stiffens the unsteady will",
    "And hardens you against the chill",
    "Voice of a world of lies.",
    "This amber medicine implants",
    "Steadfastness in your blood; this grants",
    "Immunity from greed and chance,",
    "And from all compromise.",
    "This is the serum that can cure",
    "Weak hearts; these pure, clear drops insure",
    "You\u2019ll face what comes and can endure",
    "The test; you\u2019ll never falter.",
    "This is the potion that preserves",
    "You in a faith that never swerves;",
    "This sets the pattern of your nerves",
    "Too firm for you to alter.",
    "I set this spoon between your tight",
    "Teeth, as I gave you your first bite;",
    "This satisfies your appetite",
    "For other nourishment.",
    "Take this on your tongue; this do",
    "Remembering your mother who",
    "So loved her Leader she stayed true",
    "When all the others went,",
    "When every friend proved false, in the",
    "Delirium of treachery",
    "On every hand, when even He",
    "Had turned His face aside.",
    "He shut himself in with His whore;",
    "Then, though I screamed outside His door,",
    "Said He\u2019d not see me anymore.",
    "They both took cyanide.",
    "Open wide, now, little bird;",
    "I who sang you your first word",
    "Soothe away every sound you\u2019ve heard",
    "Except your Leader\u2019s voice.",
    "Close your eyes, now; take your death.",
    "Once we slapped you to take breath.",
    "Vengeance is mine, the Lord God saith",
    "And cancels each last choice.",
    "Once, my first words marked out your mind;",
    "Just as our Leader\u2019s phrases bind",
    "All hearts to Him, building a blind",
    "Loyalty through the nation,",
    "We shape you into a pure form.",
    "Trapped, our best soldiers tricked the storm,",
    "The Reds: those last hours, they felt warm",
    "Who stood fast to their station.",
    "You needn\u2019t fear what your life meant;",
    "You won\u2019t curse how your hours were spent;",
    "You\u2019ll grow like your own monument",
    "To all things sure and good,",
    "Fixed like a frieze in high relief",
    "Of granite figures that our Chief",
    "Accepts into His true belief,",
    "His true blood-brotherhood.",
    "You\u2019ll never bite the hand that fed you,",
    "Won\u2019t turn away from those that bred you,",
    "Comforted your nights and led you",
    "Into the thought of virtue;",
    "You won\u2019t be turned from your own bed;",
    "Won\u2019t turn into that thing you dread;",
    "No new betrayal lies ahead;",
    "Now no one else can hurt you."
