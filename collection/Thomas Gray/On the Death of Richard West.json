    "In vain to me the smiling Mornings shine,",
    "And reddening Ph\u0153bus lifts his golden fire;",
    "The birds in vain their amorous descant join;",
    "Or cheerful fields resume their green attire;",
    "These ears, alas! for other notes repine,",
    "A different object do these eyes require;",
    "My lonely anguish melts no heart but mine;",
    "And in my breast the imperfect joys expire.",
    "Yet Morning smiles the busy race to cheer,",
    "And new-born pleasure brings to happier men;",
    "The fields to all their wonted tribute bear;",
    "To warm their little loves the birds complain;",
    "I fruitless mourn to him that cannot hear,",
    "And weep the more because I weep in vain."
