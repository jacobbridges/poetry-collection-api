    "If I ever get over the bodies of women, I am going to think of the rain,",
    "of waiting under the eaves of an old house",
    "at that moment",
    "when it takes a form like fog.",
    "It makes the mountain vanish.",
    "Then the smell of rain, which is the smell of the earth a plow turns up,",
    "only condensed and refined.",
    "Almost fifty years since thunder rolled",
    "and the nerves woke like secret agents under the skin.",
    "Brazil is where I wanted to live.",
    "The border is not far from here.",
    "Lonely and grateful would be my way to end,",
    "and something for the pain please,",
    "a little purity to sand the rough edges,",
    "a slow downpour from the Dark Ages,",
    "a drizzle from the Pleistocene.",
    "As I dream of the rain\u2019s long body,",
    "I will eliminate from mind all the qualities that rain deletes",
    "and then I will be primed to study rain\u2019s power,",
    "the first drops lightly hallowing,",
    "but now and again a great gallop of the horse of rain",
    "or an explosion of orange-green light.",
    "A simple radiance, it requires no discipline.",
    "Before I knew women, I knew the lonely pleasures of rain.",
    "The mist and then the clearing.",
    "I will listen where the lightning thrills the rooster up a willow,",
    "and my whole life flowing",
    "until I have no choice, only the rain,",
    "and I step into it."
