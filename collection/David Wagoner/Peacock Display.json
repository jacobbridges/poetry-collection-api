    "He approaches her, trailing his whole fortune,",
    "Perfectly cocksure, and suddenly spreads",
    "The huge fan of his tail for her amazement.",
    "Each turquoise and purple, black-horned, walleyed quill",
    "Comes quivering forward, an amphitheatric shell",
    "For his most fortunate audience: her alone.",
    "He plumes himself. He shakes his brassily gold",
    "Wings and rump in a dance, lifting his claws",
    "Stiff-legged under the great bulge of his breast.",
    "And she strolls calmly away, pecking and pausing,",
    "Not watching him, astonished to discover",
    "All these seeds spread just for her in the dirt."
