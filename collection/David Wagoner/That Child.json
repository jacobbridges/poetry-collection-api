    "That child was dangerous. That just-born",
    "Newly washed and silent baby",
    "Wrapped in deerskin and held warm",
    "Against the side of its mother could understand",
    "The language of birds and animals",
    "Even when asleep. It knew why Bluejay",
    "Was scolding the bushes, what Hawk was explaining",
    "To the wind on the cliffside, what Bittern had found out",
    "While standing alone in marsh grass. It knew",
    "What the screams of Fox and the whistling of Otter",
    "Were telling the forest. That child knew",
    "The language of Fire",
    "As it gnawed at sticks like Beaver",
    "And what Water said all day and all night",
    "At the creek's mouth. As its small fingers",
    "Closed around Stone, it held what Stone was saying.",
    "It knew what Bear Mother whispered to herself",
    "Under the snow. It could not tell",
    "Anyone what it knew. It would laugh",
    "Or cry out or startle or suddenly stare",
    "At nothing, but had no way",
    "To repeat what it was hearing, what it wanted most",
    "Not to remember. It had no way to know",
    "Why it would fall under a spell",
    "And lie still as if not breathing,",
    "Having grown afraid",
    "Of what it could understand. That child would learn",
    "To sit and crawl and stand and begin",
    "Putting one foot forward and following it",
    "With the other, would learn to put one word",
    "It could barely remember slightly ahead",
    "Of the other and then walk and speak",
    "And finally run and chatter,",
    "And all the Tillamook would know that child",
    "Had forgotten everything and at last could listen",
    "Only to people and was safe now."
