    "I've watched his eyelids sag, spring open",
    "Vaguely and gradually go sliding",
    "Shut again, fly up",
    "With a kind of drunken surprise, then wobble",
    "Peacefully together to send him",
    "Home from one school early. Soon his lashes",
    "Flutter in REM sleep. I suppose he's dreaming",
    "What all of us kings and poets and peasants",
    "Have dreamed: of not making the grade,",
    "Of draining the inexhaustible horn cup",
    "Of the cerebral cortex where ganglions",
    "Are ganging up on us with more connections",
    "Than atoms in heaven, but coming up once more",
    "Empty. I see a clear stillness",
    "Settle over his face, a calming of the surface",
    "Of water when the wind dies. Somewhere",
    "Down there, he's taking another course",
    "Whose resonance (let's hope) resembles",
    "The muttered thunder, the gutter bowling, the lightning",
    "Of minor minions of Thor, the groans and gurgling",
    "Of feral lovers and preliterate Mowglis, the songs",
    "Of shamans whistled through bird bones. A worried neighbor",
    "Gives him the elbow, and he shudders",
    "Awake, recollects himself, brings back",
    "His hands from aboriginal outposts,",
    "Takes in new light, reorganizes his shoes,",
    "Stands up in them at the buzzer, barely recalls",
    "His books and notebooks, meets my eyes",
    "And wonders what to say and whether to say it,",
    "Then keeps it to himself as today's lesson."
