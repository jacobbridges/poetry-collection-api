    "The songs we join in",
    "are beeswax candles",
    "burning with no smoke",
    "a clean fire licking at the evening",
    "our voices small flames quivering.",
    "The songs string us like beads",
    "on the hour. The ritual is",
    "its own melody that leads us",
    "where we have gone before",
    "and hope to go again, the comfort",
    "of year after year. Order:",
    "we must touch each base",
    "of the haggadah as we pass,",
    "blessing, handwashing,",
    "dipping this and that. Voices",
    "half harmonize on the",
    "Dear faces like a multitude",
    "of moons hang over the table",
    "and the truest brief blessing:",
    "affection and peace that we make."
