    "I like Rosh Hashonah late,",
    "when the leaves are half burnt",
    "umber and scarlet, when sunset",
    "marks the horizon with slow fire",
    "and the black silhouettes",
    "of migrating birds perch",
    "on the wires davening.",
    "I like Rosh Hashonah late",
    "when all living are counting",
    "their days toward death",
    "or sleep or the putting by",
    "of what will sustain them\u2014",
    "when the cold whose tendrils",
    "translucent as a jellyfish",
    "and with a hidden sting",
    "just brush our faces",
    "at twilight. The threat",
    "of frost, a premonition",
    "a warning, a whisper",
    "whose words we cannot",
    "yet decipher but will.",
    "I repent better in the waning",
    "season when the blood",
    "runs swiftly and all creatures",
    "look keenly about them",
    "for quickening danger.",
    "Then I study the rockface",
    "of my life, its granite pitted",
    "and pocked and pickaxed",
    "eroded, discolored by sun",
    "and wind and rain\u2014",
    "my rock emerging",
    "from the veil of greenery",
    "to be mapped, to be",
    "examined, to be judged."
