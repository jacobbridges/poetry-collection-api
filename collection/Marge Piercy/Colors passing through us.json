    "Purple as tulips in May, mauve",
    "into lush velvet, purple",
    "as the stain blackberries leave",
    "on the lips, on the hands,",
    "the purple of ripe grapes",
    "sunlit and warm as flesh.",
    "Every day I will give you a color,",
    "like a new flower in a bud vase",
    "on your desk. Every day",
    "I will paint you, as women",
    "color each other with henna",
    "on hands and on feet.",
    "Red as henna, as cinnamon,",
    "as coals after the fire is banked,",
    "the cardinal in the feeder,",
    "the roses tumbling on the arbor",
    "their weight bending the wood",
    "the red of the syrup I make from petals.",
    "Orange as the perfumed fruit",
    "hanging their globes on the glossy tree,",
    "orange as pumpkins in the field,",
    "orange as butterflyweed and the monarchs",
    "who come to eat it, orange as my",
    "cat running lithe through the high grass.",
    "Yellow as a goat\u2019s wise and wicked eyes,",
    "yellow as a hill of daffodils,",
    "yellow as dandelions by the highway,",
    "yellow as butter and egg yolks,",
    "yellow as a school bus stopping you,",
    "yellow as a slicker in a downpour.",
    "Here is my bouquet, here is a sing",
    "song of all the things you make",
    "me think of, here is oblique",
    "praise for the height and depth",
    "of you and the width too.",
    "Here is my box of new crayons at your feet.",
    "Green as mint jelly, green",
    "as a frog on a lily pad twanging,",
    "the green of cos lettuce upright",
    "about to bolt into opulent towers,",
    "green as Grand Chartreuse in a clear",
    "glass, green as wine bottles.",
    "Blue as cornflowers, delphiniums,",
    "bachelors\u2019 buttons. Blue as Roquefort,",
    "blue as Saga. Blue as still water.",
    "Blue as the eyes of a Siamese cat.",
    "Blue as shadows on new snow, as a spring",
    "azure sipping from a puddle on the blacktop.",
    "Cobalt as the midnight sky",
    "when day has gone without a trace",
    "and we lie in each other\u2019s arms",
    "eyes shut and fingers open",
    "and all the colors of the world",
    "pass through our bodies like strings of fire."
