    "Learning to love differently is hard,",
    "love with the hands wide open, love",
    "with the doors banging on their hinges,",
    "the cupboard unlocked, the wind",
    "roaring and whimpering in the rooms",
    "rustling the sheets and snapping the blinds",
    "that thwack like rubber bands",
    "in an open palm.",
    "It hurts to love wide open",
    "stretching the muscles that feel",
    "as if they are made of wet plaster,",
    "then of blunt knives, then",
    "of sharp knives.",
    "It hurts to thwart the reflexes",
    "of grab, of clutch ; to love and let",
    "go again and again. It pesters to remember",
    "the lover who is not in the bed,",
    "to hold back what is owed to the work",
    "that gutters like a candle in a cave",
    "without air, to love consciously,",
    "conscientiously, concretely, constructively.",
    "I can\u2019t do it, you say it\u2019s killing",
    "me, but you thrive, you glow",
    "on the street like a neon raspberry,",
    "You float and sail, a helium balloon",
    "bright bachelor\u2019s button blue and bobbing",
    "on the cold and hot winds of our breath,",
    "as we make and unmake in passionate",
    "diastole and systole the rhythm",
    "of our unbound bonding, to have",
    "and not to hold, to love",
    "with minimized malice, hunger",
    "and anger moment by moment balanced."
