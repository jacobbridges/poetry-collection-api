    "I wait for my shadow to forget me,",
    "to take that one phantom step that I keep",
    "from taking. I wait for the simple flash",
    "of a dancer's spat upon this one moon",
    "of stage-light, the mind's lonely oval",
    "illuminated on the surface of some",
    "windless pond or slew. And the old soft-shoe",
    "practices to get it right,",
    "in its constant audition of sawdust.",
    "Even this choreography of useless",
    "wishing is not enough to keep tonight",
    "from becoming nothing more than some floor's",
    "forgotten routine where faded, numbered",
    "dance-steps silently waltz themselves away.",
    "The orchestra's now ready to Faur\u00e9",
    "into the evening's last song while I try",
    "to convince myself to cross this room",
    "for the first time all night and rinse",
    "what's left in some d\u00e9butante's silver",
    "sequined waterfall, hope keeling hopelessly",
    "ever closer to the edge. Across the floor",
    "other couples sashay on. A tin flask empties",
    "itself from asking, the shadow's last chance",
    "now wasted in some chandelier's dim lust."
