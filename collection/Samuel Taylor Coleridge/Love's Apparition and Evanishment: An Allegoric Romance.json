    "Like a lone Arab, old and blind,",
    "Some caravan had left behind,",
    "Who sits beside a ruin'd well,",
    "Where the shy sand-asps bask and swell;",
    "And now he hangs his ag{'e}d head aslant,",
    "And listens for a human sound\u0097in vain!",
    "And now the aid, which Heaven alone can grant,",
    "Upturns his eyeless face from Heaven to gain;\u0097",
    "Even thus, in vacant mood, one sultry hour,",
    "Resting my eye upon a drooping plant,",
    "With brow low-bent, within my garden-bower,",
    "I sate upon the couch of camomile;",
    "And\u0097whether 'twas a transient sleep, perchance,",
    "Flitted across the idle brain, the while",
    "I watch'd the sickly calm with aimless scope,",
    "In my own heart; or that, indeed a trance,",
    "Turn'd my eye inward\u0097thee, O genial Hope,",
    "Love's elder sister! thee did I behold",
    "Drest as a bridesmaid, but all pale and cold,",
    "With roseless cheek, all pale and cold and dim,",
    "Lie lifeless at my feet!",
    "And then came Love, a sylph in bridal trim,",
    "And stood beside my seat;",
    "She bent, and kiss'd her sister's lips,",
    "As she was wont to do;\u0097",
    "Alas! 'twas but a chilling breath",
    "Woke just enough of life in death",
    "To make Hope die anew."
