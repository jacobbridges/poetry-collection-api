    "As some vast Tropic tree, itself a wood,",
    "That crests its Head with clouds, beneath the flood",
    "Feeds its deep roots, and with the bulging flank",
    "Of its wide base controls the fronting bank,",
    "(By the slant current's pressure scoop'd away",
    "The fronting bank becomes a foam-piled bay)",
    "High in the Fork the uncouth Idol knits",
    "His channel'd Brows; low murmurs stir by fits",
    "And dark below the horrid Faquir sits;",
    "An Horror from its broad Head's branchy wreath",
    "Broods o'er the rude Idolatry beneath\u0097"
