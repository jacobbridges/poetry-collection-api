    "Well, they are gone, and here must I remain,",
    "This lime-tree bower my prison! I have lost",
    "Beauties and feelings, such as would have been",
    "Most sweet to my remembrance even when age",
    "Had dimm'd mine eyes to blindness! They, meanwhile,",
    "Friends, whom I never more may meet again,",
    "On springy heath, along the hill-top edge,",
    "Wander in gladness, and wind down, perchance,",
    "To that still roaring dell, of which I told;",
    "The roaring dell, o'erwooded, narrow, deep,",
    "And only speckled by the mid-day sun;",
    "Where its slim trunk the ash from rock to rock",
    "Flings arching like a bridge;\u2014that branchless ash,",
    "Unsunn'd and damp, whose few poor yellow leaves",
    "Ne'er tremble in the gale, yet tremble still,",
    "Fann'd by the water-fall! and there my friends",
    "Behold the dark green file of long lank weeds,",
    "That all at once (a most fantastic sight!)",
    "Still nod and drip beneath the dripping edge",
    "Of the blue clay-stone.",
    "Now, my friends emerge",
    "Beneath the wide wide Heaven\u2014and view again",
    "The many-steepled tract magnificent",
    "Of hilly fields and meadows, and the sea,",
    "With some fair bark, perhaps, whose sails light up",
    "The slip of smooth clear blue betwixt two Isles",
    "Of purple shadow! Yes! they wander on",
    "In gladness all; but thou, methinks, most glad,",
    "My gentle-hearted Charles! for thou hast pined",
    "And hunger'd after Nature, many a year,",
    "In the great City pent, winning thy way",
    "With sad yet patient soul, through evil and pain",
    "And strange calamity! Ah! slowly sink",
    "Behind the western ridge, thou glorious Sun!",
    "Shine in the slant beams of the sinking orb,",
    "Ye purple heath-flowers! richlier burn, ye clouds!",
    "Live in the yellow light, ye distant groves!",
    "And kindle, thou blue Ocean! So my friend",
    "Struck with deep joy may stand, as I have stood,",
    "Silent with swimming sense; yea, gazing round",
    "On the wide landscape, gaze till all doth seem",
    "Less gross than bodily; and of such hues",
    "As veil the Almighty Spirit, when yet he makes",
    "Spirits perceive his presence.",
    "A delight",
    "Comes sudden on my heart, and I am glad",
    "As I myself were there! Nor in this bower,",
    "This little lime-tree bower, have I not mark'd",
    "Much that has sooth'd me. Pale beneath the blaze",
    "Hung the transparent foliage; and I watch'd",
    "Some broad and sunny leaf, and lov'd to see",
    "The shadow of the leaf and stem above",
    "Dappling its sunshine! And that walnut-tree",
    "Was richly ting'd, and a deep radiance lay",
    "Full on the ancient ivy, which usurps",
    "Those fronting elms, and now, with blackest mass",
    "Makes their dark branches gleam a lighter hue",
    "Through the late twilight: and though now the bat",
    "Wheels silent by, and not a swallow twitters,",
    "Yet still the solitary humble-bee",
    "Sings in the bean-flower! Henceforth I shall know",
    "That Nature ne'er deserts the wise and pure;",
    "No plot so narrow, be but Nature there,",
    "No waste so vacant, but may well employ",
    "Each faculty of sense, and keep the heart",
    "Awake to Love and Beauty! and sometimes",
    "'Tis well to be bereft of promis'd good,",
    "That we may lift the soul, and contemplate",
    "With lively joy the joys we cannot share.",
    "My gentle-hearted Charles! when the last rook",
    "Beat its straight path along the dusky air",
    "Homewards, I blest it! deeming its black wing",
    "(Now a dim speck, now vanishing in light)",
    "Had cross'd the mighty Orb's dilated glory,",
    "While thou stood'st gazing; or, when all was still,",
    "Flew creeking o'er thy head, and had a charm",
    "For thee, my gentle-hearted Charles, to whom",
    "No sound is dissonant which tells of Life."
