    "When they did greet me Father, sudden Awe",
    "Weigh'd down my spirit! I retired and knelt",
    "Seeking the throne of grace, but inly felt",
    "No heavenly visitation upwards draw",
    "My feeble mind, nor cheering ray impart.",
    "Ah me! before the Eternal Sire I brought",
    "The unquiet silence of confused Thought",
    "And shapeless feelings: my o'erwhelmed Heart",
    "Trembled: & vacant tears stream'd down my face.",
    "And now once more, O Lord! to thee I bend,",
    "Lover of souls! and groan for future grace,",
    "That, ere my Babe youth's perilous maze have trod,",
    "Thy overshadowing Spirit may descend",
    "And he be born again, a child of God!"
