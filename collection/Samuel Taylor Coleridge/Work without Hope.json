    "All Nature seems at work. Slugs leave their lair\u2014",
    "The bees are stirring\u2014birds are on the wing\u2014",
    "And Winter slumbering in the open air,",
    "Wears on his smiling face a dream of Spring!",
    "And I the while, the sole unbusy thing,",
    "Nor honey make, nor pair, nor build, nor sing.",
    "Yet well I ken the banks where amaranths blow,",
    "Have traced the fount whence streams of nectar flow.",
    "Bloom, O ye amaranths! bloom for whom ye may,",
    "For me ye bloom not! Glide, rich streams, away!",
    "With lips unbrightened, wreathless brow, I stroll:",
    "And would you learn the spells that drowse my soul?",
    "Work without Hope draws nectar in a sieve,",
    "And Hope without an object cannot live."
