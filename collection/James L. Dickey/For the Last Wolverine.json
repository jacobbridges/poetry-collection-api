    "They will soon be down",
    "To one, but he still will be",
    "For a little while still will be stopping",
    "The flakes in the air with a look,",
    "Surrounding himself with the silence",
    "Of whitening snarls. Let him eat",
    "The last red meal of the condemned",
    "To extinction, tearing the guts",
    "From an elk. Yet that is not enough",
    "For me. I would have him eat",
    "The heart, and from it, have an idea",
    "Stream into his gnarling head",
    "That he no longer has a thing",
    "To lose, and so can walk",
    "Out into the open, in the full",
    "Pale of the sub-Arctic sun",
    "Where a single spruce tree is dying",
    "Higher and higher. Let him climb it",
    "With all his meanness and strength.",
    "Lord, we have come to the end",
    "Of this kind of vision of heaven,",
    "As the sky breaks open",
    "Its fans around him and shimmers",
    "And into its northern gates he rises",
    "Snarling complete in the joy of a weasel",
    "With an elk\u2019s horned heart in his stomach",
    "Looking straight into the eternal",
    "Blue, where he hauls his kind. I would have it all",
    "My way: at the top of that tree I place",
    "The New World\u2019s last eagle",
    "Hunched in mangy feathers giving",
    "Up on the theory of flight.",
    "Dear God of the wildness of poetry, let them mate",
    "To the death in the rotten branches,",
    "Let the tree sway and burst into flame",
    "And mingle them, crackling with feathers,",
    "In crownfire. Let something come",
    "Of it something gigantic legendary",
    "Rise beyond reason over hills",
    "Of ice",
    "that it cannot die,",
    "That it has come back, this time",
    "On wings, and will spare no earthly thing:",
    "That it will hover, made purely of northern",
    "Lights, at dusk and fall",
    "On men building roads: will perch",
    "On the moose\u2019s horn like a falcon",
    "Riding into battle into holy war against",
    "Screaming railroad crews: will pull",
    "Whole traplines like fibres from the snow",
    "In the long-jawed night of fur trappers.",
    "But, small, filthy, unwinged,",
    "You will soon be crouching",
    "Alone, with maybe some dim racial notion",
    "Of being the last, but none of how much",
    "Your unnoticed going will mean:",
    "How much the timid poem needs",
    "The mindless explosion of your rage,",
    "The glutton\u2019s internal fire the elk\u2019s",
    "Heart in the belly, sprouting wings,",
    "The pact of the \u201cblind swallowing",
    "Thing,\u201d with himself, to eat",
    "The world, and not to be driven off it",
    "Until it is gone, even if it takes",
    "Forever. I take you as you are",
    "And make of you what I will,",
    "Skunk-bear, carcajoy, bloodthirsty",
    "Non-survivor."
