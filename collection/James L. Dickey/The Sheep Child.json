    "Farm boys wild to couple",
    "With anything with soft-wooded trees",
    "With mounds of earth mounds",
    "Of pinestraw will keep themselves off",
    "Animals by legends of their own:",
    "In the hay-tunnel dark",
    "And dung of barns, they will",
    "Say I have heard tell",
    "That in a museum in Atlanta",
    "Way back in a corner somewhere",
    "There\u2019s this thing that\u2019s only half",
    "Sheep like a woolly baby",
    "Pickled in alcohol because",
    "Those things can\u2019t live. his eyes",
    "Are open but you can\u2019t stand to look",
    "I heard from somebody who ...",
    "But this is now almost all",
    "Gone. The boys have taken",
    "Their own true wives in the city,",
    "The sheep are safe in the west hill",
    "Pasture but we who were born there",
    "Still are not sure. Are we,",
    "Because we remember, remembered",
    "In the terrible dust of museums?",
    "Merely with his eyes, the sheep-child may",
    "Be saying saying",
    "I who am half of your world, came deeply",
    "To my mother in the long grass",
    "Of the west pasture, where she stood like moonlight",
    "Listening for foxes. It was something like love",
    "From another world that seized her",
    "From behind, and she gave, not lifting her head",
    "Out of dew, without ever looking, her best",
    "Self to that great need. Turned loose, she dipped her face",
    "Farther into the chill of the earth, and in a sound",
    "Of sobbing of something stumbling",
    "Away, began, as she must do,",
    "To carry me. I woke, dying,",
    "In the summer sun of the hillside, with my eyes",
    "Far more than human. I saw for a blazing moment",
    "The great grassy world from both sides,",
    "Man and beast in the round of their need,",
    "And the hill wind stirred in my wool,",
    "My hoof and my hand clasped each other,",
    "I ate my one meal",
    "Of milk, and died",
    "Staring. From dark grass I came straight",
    "To my father\u2019s house, whose dust",
    "Whirls up in the halls for no reason",
    "When no one comes piling deep in a hellish mild corner,",
    "And, through my immortal waters,",
    "I meet the sun\u2019s grains eye",
    "To eye, and they fail at my closet of glass.",
    "Dead, I am most surely living",
    "In the minds of farm boys: I am he who drives",
    "Them like wolves from the hound bitch and calf",
    "And from the chaste ewe in the wind.",
    "They go into woods into bean fields they go",
    "Deep into their known right hands. Dreaming of me,",
    "They groan they wait they suffer",
    "Themselves, they marry, they raise their kind."
