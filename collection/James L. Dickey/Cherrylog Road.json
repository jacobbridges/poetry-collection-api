    "Off Highway 106",
    "At Cherrylog Road I entered",
    "The \u201934 Ford without wheels,",
    "Smothered in kudzu,",
    "With a seat pulled out to run",
    "Corn whiskey down from the hills,",
    "And then from the other side",
    "Crept into an Essex",
    "With a rumble seat of red leather",
    "And then out again, aboard",
    "A blue Chevrolet, releasing",
    "The rust from its other color,",
    "Reared up on three building blocks.",
    "None had the same body heat;",
    "I changed with them inward, toward",
    "The weedy heart of the junkyard,",
    "For I knew that Doris Holbrook",
    "Would escape from her father at noon",
    "And would come from the farm",
    "To seek parts owned by the sun",
    "Among the abandoned chassis,",
    "Sitting in each in turn",
    "As I did, leaning forward",
    "As in a wild stock-car race",
    "In the parking lot of the dead.",
    "Time after time, I climbed in",
    "And out the other side, like",
    "An envoy or movie star",
    "Met at the station by crickets.",
    "A radiator cap raised its head,",
    "Become a real toad or a kingsnake",
    "As I neared the hub of the yard,",
    "Passing through many states,",
    "Many lives, to reach",
    "Some grandmother\u2019s long Pierce-Arrow",
    "Sending platters of blindness forth",
    "From its nickel hubcaps",
    "And spilling its tender upholstery",
    "On sleepy roaches,",
    "The glass panel in between",
    "Lady and colored driver",
    "Not all the way broken out,",
    "The back-seat phone",
    "Still on its hook.",
    "I got in as though to exclaim,",
    "\u201cLet us go to the orphan asylum,",
    "John; I have some old toys",
    "For children who say their prayers.\u201d",
    "I popped with sweat as I thought",
    "I heard Doris Holbrook scrape",
    "Like a mouse in the southern-state sun",
    "That was eating the paint in blisters",
    "From a hundred car tops and hoods.",
    "She was tapping like code,",
    "Loosening the screws,",
    "Carrying off headlights,",
    "Sparkplugs, bumpers,",
    "Cracked mirrors and gear-knobs,",
    "Getting ready, already,",
    "To go back with something to show",
    "Other than her lips\u2019 new trembling",
    "I would hold to me soon, soon,",
    "Where I sat in the ripped back seat",
    "Talking over the interphone,",
    "Praying for Doris Holbrook",
    "To come from her father\u2019s farm",
    "And to get back there",
    "With no trace of me on her face",
    "To be seen by her red-haired father",
    "Who would change, in the squalling barn,",
    "Her back\u2019s pale skin with a strop,",
    "Then lay for me",
    "In a bootlegger\u2019s roasting car",
    "With a string-triggered I2-gauge shotgun",
    "To blast the breath from the air.",
    "Not cut by the jagged windshields,",
    "Through the acres of wrecks she came",
    "With a wrench in her hand,",
    "Through dust where the blacksnake dies",
    "Of boredom, and the beetle knows",
    "The compost has no more life.",
    "Someone outside would have seen",
    "The oldest car's door inexplicably",
    "Close from within:",
    "I held her and held her and held her,",
    "Convoyed at terrific speed",
    "By the stalled, dreaming traffic around us,",
    "So the blacksnake, stiff",
    "With inaction, curved back",
    "Into life, and hunted the mouse",
    "With deadly overexcitement,",
    "The beetles reclaimed their field",
    "As we clung, glued together,",
    "With the hooks of the seat springs",
    "Working through to catch us red-handed",
    "Amidst the gray breathless batting",
    "That burst from the seat at our backs.",
    "We left by separate doors",
    "Into the changed, other bodies",
    "Of cars, she down Cherrylog Road",
    "And I to my motorcycle",
    "Parked like the soul of the junkyard",
    "Restored, a bicycle fleshed",
    "With power, and tore off",
    "Up Highway 106, continually",
    "Drunk on the wind in my mouth,",
    "Wringing the handlebar for speed,",
    "Wild to be wreckage forever."
