    "Beginning to dangle beneath",
    "The wind that blows from the undermined wood,",
    "I feel the great pulley grind,",
    "The thread I cling to lengthen",
    "And let me soaring and spinning down into marble,",
    "Hooked and weightlessly happy",
    "Where the squared sun shines",
    "Back equally from all four sides, out of stone",
    "And years of dazzling labor,",
    "To land at last among men",
    "Who cut with power saws a Parian whiteness",
    "And, chewing slow tobacco,",
    "Their eyebrows like frost,",
    "Shunt house-sized blocks and lash them to cables",
    "And send them heavenward",
    "Into small-town banks,",
    "Into the columns and statues of government buildings,",
    "But mostly graves.",
    "I mount my monument and rise",
    "Slowly and spinningly from the white-gloved men",
    "Toward the hewn sky",
    "Out of the basement of light,",
    "Sadly, lifted through time\u2019s blinding layers",
    "On perhaps my tombstone",
    "In which the original shape",
    "Michelangelo believed was in every rock upon earth",
    "Is heavily stirring,",
    "Surprised to be an angel,",
    "To be waked in North Georgia by the ponderous play",
    "Of men with ten-ton blocks",
    "But no more surprised than I",
    "To feel sadness fall off as though I myself",
    "Were rising from stone",
    "Held by a thread in midair,",
    "Badly cut, local-looking, and totally uninspired,",
    "Not a masterwork",
    "Or even worth seeing at all",
    "But the spirit of this place just the same,",
    "Felt here as joy."
