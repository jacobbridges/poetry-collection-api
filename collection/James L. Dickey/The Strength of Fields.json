    "Moth-force a small town always has,",
    "Given the night.",
    "What field-forms can be,",
    "Outlying the small civic light-decisions over",
    "A man walking near home?",
    "Men are not where he is",
    "Exactly now, but they are around him around him like the strength",
    "Of fields. The solar system floats on",
    "Above him in town-moths.",
    "Tell me, train-sound,",
    "With all your long-lost grief,",
    "what I can give.",
    "Dear Lord of all the fields",
    "what am I going to",
    "?",
    "Street-lights, blue-force and frail",
    "As the homes of men, tell me how to do it how",
    "To withdraw how to penetrate and find the source",
    "Of the power you always had",
    "light as a moth, and rising",
    "With the level and moonlit expansion",
    "Of the fields around, and the sleep of hoping men.",
    "You? I? What difference is there? We can all be saved",
    "By a secret blooming. Now as I walk",
    "The night and you walk with me we know simplicity",
    "Is close to the source that sleeping men",
    "Search for in their home-deep beds.",
    "We know that the sun is away we know that the sun can be conquered",
    "By moths, in blue home-town air.",
    "The stars splinter, pointed and wild. The dead lie under",
    "The pastures. They look on and help. Tell me, freight-train,",
    "When there is no one else",
    "To hear. Tell me in a voice the sea",
    "Would have, if it had not a better one: as it lifts,",
    "Hundreds of miles away, its fumbling, deep-structured roar",
    "Like the profound, unstoppable craving",
    "Of nations for their wish.",
    "Hunger, time and the moon:",
    "The moon lying on the brain",
    "as on the excited sea as on",
    "The strength of fields. Lord, let me shake",
    "With purpose. Wild hope can always spring",
    "From tended strength. Everything is in that.",
    "That and nothing but kindness. More kindness, dear Lord",
    "Of the renewing green. That is where it all has to start:",
    "With the simplest things. More kindness will do nothing less",
    "Than save every sleeping one",
    "And night-walking one",
    "Of us.",
    "My life belongs to the world. I will do what I can."
