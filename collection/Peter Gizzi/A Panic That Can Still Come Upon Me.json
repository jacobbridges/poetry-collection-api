    "If today and today I am calling aloud",
    "If I break into pieces of glitter on asphalt",
    "bits of sun, the din",
    "if tires whine on wet pavement",
    "everything humming",
    "If we find we are still in motion",
    "and have arrived in Zeno\u2019s thought, like",
    "if sunshine hits marble and the sea lights up",
    "we might know we were loved, are loved",
    "if flames and harvest, the enchanted plain",
    "If our wishes are met with dirt",
    "and thyme, thistle, oil,",
    "heirloom, and basil",
    "or the end result is worry, chaos",
    "and if \u201cI should know better\u201d",
    "If our loves are anointed with missiles",
    "Apache fire, Tomahawks",
    "did we follow the tablets the pilgrims suggested",
    "If we ask that every song touch its origin",
    "just once and the years engulfed",
    "If problems of identity confound sages,",
    "derelict philosophers, administrators",
    "who can say I am found",
    "if this time you, all of it, this time now",
    "If nothing save Saturdays at the metro and",
    "if rain falls sidelong in the platz",
    "doorways, onto mansard roofs",
    "If enumerations of the fall",
    "and if falling, cities rocked",
    "with gas fires at dawn",
    "Can you rescind the ghost\u2019s double nakedness",
    "hungry and waning",
    "if children, soldiers, children",
    "taken down in schools",
    "if burning fuel",
    "Who can\u2019t say they have seen this",
    "and can we sing this",
    "if in the auroras\u2019 reflecting the sea,",
    "gauze touching the breast",
    "Too bad for you, beautiful singer",
    "unadorned by laurel",
    "child of thunder and scapegoat alike",
    "If the crowd in the mind becoming",
    "crowded in street and villages, and trains",
    "run next to the freeway",
    "If exit is merely a sign"
