    "For why am I afraid to sing",
    "the fundamental shape of awe",
    "should I now begin to sing the silvered back of",
    "the winter willow spear",
    "the sparkling agate blue",
    "would this blade and this sky free me to speak",
    "intransitive lack \u2013",
    "the vowels themselves free",
    "Of what am I afraid",
    "of what lies in back of me of day",
    "these stars scattered as far as the I",
    "what world and wherefore",
    "will it shake free",
    "why now in the mind of an afternoon is a daisy",
    "for a while",
    "flagrant and alive",
    "Then what of night",
    "of hours\u2019 unpredicated bad luck and the rot",
    "it clings to",
    "fathomless on the far side in winter dark",
    "Hey shadow world when a thing comes back",
    "comes back unseen but felt and no longer itself",
    "what then",
    "what silver world mirrors tarnished lenses",
    "what fortune what fate",
    "and the forms not themselves but only itself the sky",
    "by water and wind shaken",
    "I am born in silvered dark",
    "Of what am I to see these things between myself",
    "and nothing",
    "between the curtain and the stain",
    "between the hypostatic scenes of breathing",
    "and becoming the thing I see",
    "are they not the same",
    "Things don\u2019t look good on the street today",
    "beside a tower in a rusting lot",
    "one is a condition the other mystery",
    "even this afternoon light so kind and nourishing",
    "a towering absence vibrating air",
    "Shake and I see pots from old shake",
    "and I see cities anew",
    "I see robes shake I see desert",
    "I see the farthing in us all the ghost of day",
    "the day inside night as tones decay",
    "and border air",
    "it is the old songs and the present wind I sing",
    "and say I love the unknown sound in a word",
    "Mother where from did you leave me on the sleeve",
    "of a dying word",
    "of impish laughter in the midst my joy",
    "I compel and confess open form",
    "my cracked hinged picture doubled",
    "I can\u2019t remember now if I made a pact with the devil",
    "when I was young",
    "when I was high",
    "on a sidewalk I hear \u201cbuy a sweatshirt?\u201d and think",
    "buy a shirt from the sweat of children",
    "hell",
    "I\u2019m just taking a walk in the sun in a poem",
    "and this sound",
    "caught in the most recent coup"
