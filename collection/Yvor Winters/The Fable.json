    "Beyond the steady rock the steady sea,",
    "In movement more immovable than station,",
    "Gathers and washes and is gone. It comes,",
    "A slow obscure metonymy of motion,",
    "Crumbling the inner barriers of the brain.",
    "But the crossed rock braces the hills and makes",
    "A steady quiet of the steady music,",
    "Massive with peace.",
    "And listen, now:",
    "The foam receding down the sand silvers",
    "Between the grains, thin, pure as virgin words,",
    "Lending a sheen to Nothing, whispering."
