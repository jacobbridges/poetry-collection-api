    "See how the arch\u00e8d earth does here",
    "Rise in a perfect hemisphere!",
    "The stiffest compass could not strike",
    "A line more circular and like;",
    "Nor softest pencil draw a brow",
    "So equal as this hill does bow.",
    "It seems as for a model laid,",
    "And that the world by it was made.",
    "Here learn, ye mountains more unjust,",
    "Which to abrupter greatness thrust,",
    "That do with your hook-shouldered height",
    "The earth deform and heaven fright,",
    "For whose excrescence, ill-designed,",
    "Nature must a new centre find,",
    "Learn here those humble steps to tread,",
    "Which to securer glory lead.",
    "See what a soft access and wide",
    "Lies open to its grassy side;",
    "Nor with the rugged path deters",
    "The feet of breathless travellers.",
    "See then how courteous it ascends,",
    "And all the way it rises bends;",
    "Nor for itself the height does gain,",
    "But only strives to raise the plain.",
    "Yet thus it all the field commands,",
    "And in unenvied greatness stands,",
    "Discerning further than the cliff",
    "Of heaven-daring Tenerife.",
    "How glad the weary seamen haste",
    "When they salute it from the mast!",
    "By night the Northern Star their way",
    "Directs, and this no less by day.",
    "Upon its crest this mountain grave",
    "A plump of ag\u00e8d trees does wave.",
    "No hostile hand durst ere invade",
    "With impious steel the sacred shade.",
    "For something always did appear",
    "Of the great Master\u2019s terror there:",
    "And men could hear his armour still",
    "Rattling through all the grove and hill.",
    "Fear of the Master, and respect",
    "Of the great Nymph, did it protect,",
    "Vera the Nymph that him inspired,",
    "To whom he often here retired,",
    "And on these oaks engraved her name;",
    "Such wounds alone these woods became:",
    "But ere he well the barks could part",
    "\u2019Twas writ already in their heart.",
    "For they (\u2019tis credible) have sense,",
    "As we, of love and reverence,",
    "And underneath the coarser rind",
    "The genius of the house do bind.",
    "Hence they successes seem to know,",
    "And in their Lord\u2019s advancement grow;",
    "But in no memory were seen,",
    "As under this, so straight and green;",
    "Yet now no further strive to shoot,",
    "Contented if they fix their root.",
    "Nor to the wind\u2019s uncertain gust,",
    "Their prudent heads too far intrust.",
    "Only sometimes a fluttering breeze",
    "Discourses with the breathing trees,",
    "Which in their modest whispers name",
    "Those acts that swelled the cheek of fame.",
    "\u2018Much other groves\u2019, say they, \u2018than these",
    "And other hills him once did please.",
    "Through groves of pikes he thundered then,",
    "And mountains raised of dying men.",
    "For all the civic garlands due",
    "To him, our branches are but few.",
    "Nor are our trunks enow to bear",
    "The trophies of one fertile year.\u2019",
    "\u2019Tis true, ye trees, nor ever spoke",
    "More certain oracles in oak.",
    "But peace, (if you his favour prize):",
    "That courage its own praises flies.",
    "Therefore to your obscurer seats",
    "From his own brightness he retreats:",
    "Nor he the hills without the groves,",
    "Nor height, but with retirement, loves."
