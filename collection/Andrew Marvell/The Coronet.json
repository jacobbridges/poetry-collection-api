    "When for the thorns with which I long, too long,",
    "With many a piercing wound,",
    "My Saviour\u2019s head have crowned,",
    "I seek with garlands to redress that wrong:",
    "Through every garden, every mead,",
    "I gather flowers (my fruits are only flowers),",
    "Dismantling all the fragrant towers",
    "That once adorned my shepherdess\u2019s head.",
    "And now when I have summed up all my store,",
    "Thinking (so I myself deceive)",
    "So rich a chaplet thence to weave",
    "As never yet the King of Glory wore:",
    "Alas, I find the serpent old",
    "That, twining in his speckled breast,",
    "About the flowers disguised does fold,",
    "With wreaths of fame and interest.",
    "Ah, foolish man, that wouldst debase with them,",
    "And mortal glory, Heaven\u2019s diadem!",
    "But Thou who only couldst the serpent tame,",
    "Either his slippery knots at once untie;",
    "And disentangle all his winding snare;",
    "Or shatter too with him my curious frame,",
    "And let these wither, so that he may die,",
    "Though set with skill and chosen out with care:",
    "That they, while Thou on both their spoils dost tread,",
    "May crown thy feet, that could not crown thy head."
