    "Come, little infant, love me now,",
    "While thine unsuspected years",
    "Clear thine ag\u00e8d father\u2019s brow",
    "From cold jealousy and fears.",
    "Pretty, surely, \u2019twere to see",
    "By young love old time beguiled,",
    "While our sportings are as free",
    "As the nurse\u2019s with the child.",
    "Common beauties stay fifteen;",
    "Such as yours should swifter move,",
    "Whose fair blossoms are too green",
    "Yet for lust, but not for love.",
    "Love as much the snowy lamb,",
    "Or the wanton kid, does prize,",
    "As the lusty bull or ram,",
    "For his morning sacrifice.",
    "Now then love me: time may take",
    "Thee before thy time away:",
    "Of this need we\u2019ll virtue make,",
    "And learn love before we may.",
    "So we win of doubtful fate;",
    "And if good she to us meant,",
    "We that good shall antedate,",
    "Or, if ill, that ill prevent.",
    "Thus as kingdoms, frustrating",
    "Other titles to their crown,",
    "In the cradle crown their king,",
    "So all foreign claims to drown,",
    "So, to make all rivals vain,",
    "Now I crown thee with my love:",
    "Crown me with thy love again,",
    "And we both shall monarchs prove."
