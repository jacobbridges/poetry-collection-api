    "Lying in bed I think about you,",
    "your ugly empty airless apartment",
    "and your eyes. It\u2019s noon, and tired",
    "I look into the rest of the awake day",
    "incapable of even awe, just",
    "a presence of particle and wave,",
    "just that closed and deliberate",
    "human observance. Your thin fingers",
    "and the dissolution of all ability. Lay",
    "open now to only me that white body,",
    "and I will, as the awkward butterfly,",
    "land quietly upon you. A grace and",
    "staying. A sight and ease. A spell",
    "entangled. A span. I am inside you.",
    "And so both projected, we are now",
    "part of a garden, that is part of a",
    "landscape, that is part of a world",
    "that no one believes in."
