    "And, the last day being come, Man stood alone",
    "Ere sunrise on the world\u2019s dismantled verge,",
    "Awaiting how from everywhere should urge",
    "The Coming of the Lord. And, behold, none",
    "Did come,\u2014but indistinct from every realm",
    "Of earth and air and water, growing more",
    "And louder, shriller, heavier, a roar",
    "Up the dun atmosphere did overwhelm",
    "His ears; and as he looked affrighted round",
    "Every manner of beast innumerable",
    "All thro\u2019 the shadows crying grew, until",
    "The wailing was like grass upon the ground.",
    "Asudden then within his human side",
    "Their anguish, since the goad he wielded first,",
    "And, since he gave them not to drink, their thirst,",
    "Darted compressed and vital.\u2014As he died,",
    "Low in the East now lighting gorgeously",
    "He saw the last sea-serpent iris-mailed",
    "Which, with a spear transfix\u00e8d, yet availed",
    "To pluck the sun down into the dead sea."
