    "Leave him now quiet by the way",
    "To rest apart.",
    "I know what draws him to the dust alway",
    "And churns him in the builder\u2019s lime:",
    "He has the fright of time.",
    "I heard it knocking in his breast",
    "A minute since;",
    "His human eyes did wince,",
    "He stubborned like the massive slaughter beast",
    "And as a thing o\u2019erwhelmed with sound",
    "Stood bolted to the ground.",
    "Leave him, for rest alone can cure\u2014",
    "If cure there be\u2014",
    "This waif upon the sea.",
    "He is of those who slanted the great door",
    "And listened\u2014wretched little lad\u2014",
    "To what they said."
