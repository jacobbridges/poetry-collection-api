    "You say, Columbus with his argosies",
    "Who rash and greedy took the screaming main",
    "And vanished out before the hurricane",
    "Into the sunset after merchandise,",
    "Then under western palms with simple eyes",
    "Trafficked and robbed and triumphed home again:",
    "You say this is the glory of the brain",
    "And human life no other use than this?",
    "I then do answering say to you: The line",
    "Of wizards and of saviours, keeping trust",
    "In that which made them pensive and divine,",
    "Passes before us like a cloud of dust.",
    "What were they? Actors, ill and mad with wine,",
    "And all their language babble and disgust."
