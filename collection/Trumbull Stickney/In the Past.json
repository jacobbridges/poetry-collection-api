    "There lies a somnolent lake",
    "Under a noiseless sky,",
    "Where never the mornings break",
    "Nor the evenings die.",
    "Mad flakes of colour",
    "Whirl on its even face",
    "Iridescent and streaked with pallour;",
    "And, warding the silent place,",
    "The rocks rise sheer and gray",
    "From the sedgeless brink to the sky",
    "Dull-lit with the light of pale half-day",
    "Thro\u2019 a void space and dry.",
    "And the hours lag dead in the air",
    "With a sense of coming eternity",
    "To the heart of the lonely boatman there:",
    "That boatman am I,",
    "I, in my lonely boat,",
    "A waif on the somnolent lake,",
    "Watching the colours creep and float",
    "With the sinuous track of a snake.",
    "Now I lean o\u2019er the side",
    "And lazy shades in the water see,",
    "Lapped in the sweep of a sluggish tide",
    "Crawled in from the living sea;",
    "And next I fix mine eyes,",
    "So long that the heart declines,",
    "On the changeless face of the open skies",
    "Where no star shines;",
    "And now to the rocks I turn,",
    "To the rocks, around",
    "That lie like walls of a circling sun",
    "Wherein lie bound",
    "The waters that feel my powerless strength",
    "And meet my homeless oar",
    "Labouring over their ashen length",
    "Never to find a shore.",
    "But the gleam still skims",
    "At times on the somnolent lake,",
    "And a light there is that swims",
    "With the whirl of a snake;",
    "And tho\u2019 dead be the hours i\u2019 the air,",
    "And dayless the sky,",
    "The heart is alive of the boatman there:",
    "That boatman am I."
