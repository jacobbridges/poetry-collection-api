    "Two wandering across the porcelain",
    "Siberia, one alone on the window sill,",
    "four across the ceiling's senseless field",
    "of pale yellow, one negotiating folds",
    "in a towel: tiny, bronze-colored, antennae",
    "'strongly elbowed,' crawling over",
    ", face down, unsurprised,",
    "one dead in the mountainous bar of soap.",
    "Sub-family",
    "(a single",
    "segment behind the thorax), the sickle",
    "moons of their abdomens, one trapped in bubbles",
    "(I soak in the tub); with no clear purpose",
    "they come in by the baseboard, do not bite,",
    "crush bloodless beneath a finger.",
    "calls them 'social creatures,' yet what grim",
    "society: identical pilgrims,",
    "seed-like, brittle, pausing on the path",
    "only three seconds to touch another's",
    "face, some hoisting the papery carcasses",
    "of their dead in their jaws, which open and close",
    "like the clasp of a necklace. 'Mating occurs",
    "in flight'\u2014 what better way? Weightless, reckless",
    "rapture: the winged queen and her mate, quantum",
    "passion spiraling near the kumquat,",
    "and then the queen sheds her wings, plants",
    "the pearl-like larvae in their cribs of sand:",
    "more anvil-headed, creeping attentions",
    "to follow cracks in the tile, the lip of the tub,",
    "and one starting across the mirror now, doubled."
