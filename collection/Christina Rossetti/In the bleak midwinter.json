    "In the bleak midwinter, frosty wind made moan,",
    "Earth stood hard as iron, water like a stone;",
    "Snow had fallen, snow on snow, snow on snow,",
    "In the bleak midwinter, long ago.",
    "Our God, Heaven cannot hold Him, nor earth sustain;",
    "Heaven and earth shall flee away when He comes to reign.",
    "In the bleak midwinter a stable place sufficed",
    "The Lord God Almighty, Jesus Christ.",
    "Enough for Him, whom cherubim, worship night and day,",
    "Breastful of milk, and a mangerful of hay;",
    "Enough for Him, whom angels fall before,",
    "The ox and ass and camel which adore.",
    "Angels and archangels may have gathered there,",
    "Cherubim and seraphim thronged the air;",
    "But His mother only, in her maiden bliss,",
    "Worshipped the beloved with a kiss.",
    "What can I give Him, poor as I am?",
    "If I were a shepherd, I would bring a lamb;",
    "If I were a Wise Man, I would do my part;",
    "Yet what I can I give Him: give my heart."
