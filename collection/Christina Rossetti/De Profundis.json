    "Oh why is heaven built so far,",
    "Oh why is earth set so remote?",
    "I cannot reach the nearest star",
    "That hangs afloat.",
    "I would not care to reach the moon,",
    "One round monotonous of change;",
    "Yet even she repeats her tune",
    "Beyond my range.",
    "I never watch the scatter'd fire",
    "Of stars, or sun's far-trailing train,",
    "But all my heart is one desire,",
    "And all in vain:",
    "For I am bound with fleshly bands,",
    "Joy, beauty, lie beyond my scope;",
    "I strain my heart, I stretch my hands,",
    "And catch at hope."
