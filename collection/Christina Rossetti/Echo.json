    "Come to me in the silence of the night;",
    "Come in the speaking silence of a dream;",
    "Come with soft rounded cheeks and eyes as bright",
    "As sunlight on a stream;",
    "Come back in tears,",
    "O memory, hope, love of finished years.",
    "Oh dream how sweet, too sweet, too bitter sweet,",
    "Whose wakening should have been in Paradise,",
    "Where souls brimfull of love abide and meet;",
    "Where thirsting longing eyes",
    "Watch the slow door",
    "That opening, letting in, lets out no more.",
    "Yet come to me in dreams, that I may live",
    "My very life again tho\u2019 cold in death:",
    "Come back to me in dreams, that I may give",
    "Pulse for pulse, breath for breath:",
    "Speak low, lean low,",
    "As long ago, my love, how long ago."
