    "Where sunless rivers weep",
    "Their waves into the deep,",
    "She sleeps a charmed sleep:",
    "Awake her not.",
    "Led by a single star,",
    "She came from very far",
    "To seek where shadows are",
    "Her pleasant lot.",
    "She left the rosy morn,",
    "She left the fields of corn,",
    "For twilight cold and lorn",
    "And water springs.",
    "Through sleep, as through a veil,",
    "She sees the sky look pale,",
    "And hears the nightingale",
    "That sadly sings.",
    "Rest, rest, a perfect rest",
    "Shed over brow and breast;",
    "Her face is toward the west,",
    "The purple land.",
    "She cannot see the grain",
    "Ripening on hill and plain;",
    "She cannot feel the rain",
    "Upon her hand.",
    "Rest, rest, for evermore",
    "Upon a mossy shore;",
    "Rest, rest at the heart's core",
    "Till time shall cease:",
    "Sleep that no pain shall wake;",
    "Night that no morn shall break",
    "Till joy shall overtake",
    "Her perfect peace."
