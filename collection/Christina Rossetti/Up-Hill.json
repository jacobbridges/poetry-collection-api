    "Does the road wind up-hill all the way?",
    "Yes, to the very end.",
    "Will the day\u2019s journey take the whole long day?",
    "From morn to night, my friend.",
    "But is there for the night a resting-place?",
    "A roof for when the slow dark hours begin.",
    "May not the darkness hide it from my face?",
    "You cannot miss that inn.",
    "Shall I meet other wayfarers at night?",
    "Those who have gone before.",
    "Then must I knock, or call when just in sight?",
    "They will not keep you standing at that door.",
    "Shall I find comfort, travel-sore and weak?",
    "Of labour you shall find the sum.",
    "Will there be beds for me and all who seek?",
    "Yea, beds for all who come."
