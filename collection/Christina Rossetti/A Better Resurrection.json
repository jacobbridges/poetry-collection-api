    "I have no wit, no words, no tears;",
    "My heart within me like a stone",
    "Is numb'd too much for hopes or fears;",
    "Look right, look left, I dwell alone;",
    "I lift mine eyes, but dimm'd with grief",
    "No everlasting hills I see;",
    "My life is in the falling leaf:",
    "O Jesus, quicken me.",
    "My life is like a faded leaf,",
    "My harvest dwindled to a husk:",
    "Truly my life is void and brief",
    "And tedious in the barren dusk;",
    "My life is like a frozen thing,",
    "No bud nor greenness can I see:",
    "Yet rise it shall\u0097the sap of Spring;",
    "O Jesus, rise in me.",
    "My life is like a broken bowl,",
    "A broken bowl that cannot hold",
    "One drop of water for my soul",
    "Or cordial in the searching cold;",
    "Cast in the fire the perish'd thing;",
    "Melt and remould it, till it be",
    "A royal cup for Him, my King:",
    "O Jesus, drink of me."
