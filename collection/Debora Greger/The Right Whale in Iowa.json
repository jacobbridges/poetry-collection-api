    "The shag rug of a Great Plains buffalo,",
    "a flightless bird",
    "gone to stone: over its fellow keepsakes,",
    "into the archives of air,",
    "the whale hauled a harvest of dust.",
    "In the ripples of glass",
    "sealed over songbird skins, I wavered.",
    "What could be said for love?",
    "From the Full-Serv to the Self-Serv Island",
    "at the Gulf station next door,",
    "landlocked waves shivered in a row of corn.",
    "The great flukes lifted.",
    "A Milky Way scarred the underside more vast",
    "than the Midwestern night.",
    "Dark cargoes would give themselves up",
    "to these shallows",
    "that waited to take home the sailor,",
    "home to the sea",
    "of fossilized coral upon whose shoals",
    "just down the road",
    "the motels of Coralville lay sprawled.",
    "Here would lie a ring",
    "scratched by a scrivener with florid hand,",
    "flung back to shore, here rest two coins",
    "face to face, joined",
    "by the salt that turned them faceless",
    "as they turned to each other."
