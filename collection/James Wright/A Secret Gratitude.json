    "\u2014Edmund Wilson",
    "1",
    "She cleaned house, and then lay down long",
    "On the long stair.",
    "On one of those cold white wings",
    "That the strange fowl provide for us like one hillside of the sea,",
    "That cautery of snow that blinds us,",
    "Pitiless light,",
    "One winter afternoon",
    "Fair near the place where she sank down with one wing broken,",
    "Three friends and I were caught",
    "Stalk still in the light.",
    "Five of the lights. Why should they care for our eyes?",
    "Five deer stood there.",
    "They looked back, a good minute.",
    "They knew us, all right:",
    "Four chemical accidents of horror pausing",
    "Between one suicide or another",
    "On the passing wing",
    "Of an angel that cared no more for our biology, our pity, and our pain",
    "Than we care.",
    "Why should any mere multitude of the angels care",
    "To lay one blind white plume down",
    "On this outermost limit of something that is probably no more",
    "Than an aphid,",
    "An aphid which is one of the angels whose wings toss the black pears",
    "Of tears down on the secret shores",
    "Of the seas in the corner",
    "Of a poet\u2019s closed eye.",
    "Why should five deer",
    "Gaze back at us?",
    "They gazed back at us.",
    "Afraid, and yet they stood there,",
    "More alive than we four, in their terror,",
    "In their good time.",
    "We had a dog.",
    "We could have got other dogs.",
    "Two or three dogs could have taken turns running and dragging down",
    "Those fleet lights, whose tails must look as mysterious as the",
    "Stars in Los Angeles.",
    "We are men.",
    "It doesn\u2019t even satisfy us",
    "To kill one another.",
    "We are a smear of obscenity",
    "On the lake whose only peace",
    "Is a hole where the moon",
    "Abandoned us, that poor",
    "Girl who can\u2019t leave us alone.",
    "If I were the moon I would shrink into a sand grain",
    "In the corner of the poet\u2019s eye,",
    "While there\u2019s still room.",
    "We are men.",
    "We are capable of anything.",
    "We could have killed every one of those deer.",
    "The very moon of lovers tore herself with the agony of a wounded tigress",
    "Out of our side.",
    "We can kill anything.",
    "We can kill our own bodies.",
    "Those deer on the hillside have no idea what in hell",
    "We are except murderers.",
    "They know that much, and don\u2019t think",
    "They don\u2019t.",
    "Man\u2019s heart is the rotten yolk of a blacksnake egg",
    "Corroding, as it is just born, in a pile of dead",
    "Horse dung.",
    "I have no use for the human creature.",
    "He subtly extracts pain awake in his own kind.",
    "I am born one, out of an accidental hump of chemistry.",
    "I have no use.",
    "2",
    "But",
    "We didn\u2019t set dogs on the deer,",
    "Even though we know,",
    "As well as you know,",
    "We could have got away with it,",
    "Because",
    "Who cares?",
    "3",
    "Boissevain, who was he?",
    "Was he human? I doubt it,",
    "From what I know",
    "Of men.",
    "Who was he,",
    "Hobbling with his dry eyes",
    "Along in the rain?",
    "I think he must have fallen down like the plumes of new snow,",
    "I think he must have fallen into the grass, I think he",
    "Must surely have grown around",
    "Her wings, gathering and being gathered,",
    "Leaf, string, anything she could use",
    "To build her still home of songs",
    "Within sound of water.",
    "4",
    "By God, come to that, I would have married her too,",
    "If I\u2019d got the chance, and she\u2019d let me.",
    "Think of that. Being alive with a girl",
    "Who could turn into a laurel tree",
    "Whenever she felt like it.",
    "Think of that.",
    "5",
    "Outside my window just now",
    "I can hear a small waterfall rippling antiphonally down over",
    "The stones of my poem."
