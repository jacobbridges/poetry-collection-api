    "I will grieve alone,",

    "Upstream from the sewer main,",
    "Pondering, gazing.",
    "I saw, down river,",
    "At Twenty-third and Water Streets",
    "By the vinegar works,",
    "The doors open in early evening.",
    "Swinging their purses, the women",
    "Poured down the long street to the river",
    "And into the river.",
    "I do not know how it was",
    "They could drown every evening.",
    "What time near dawn did they climb up the other shore,",
    "Drying their wings?",
    "For the river at Wheeling, West Virginia,",
    "Has only two shores:",
    "The one in hell, the other",
    "In Bridgeport, Ohio.",
    "And nobody would commit suicide, only",
    "To find beyond death",
    "Bridgeport, Ohio."
