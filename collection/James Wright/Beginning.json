    "The moon drops one or two feathers into the field.",
    "The dark wheat listens.",
    "Be still.",
    "Now.",
    "There they are, the moon's young, trying",
    "Their wings.",
    "Between trees, a slender woman lifts up the lovely shadow",
    "Of her face, and now she steps into the air, now she is gone",
    "Wholly, into the air.",
    "I stand alone by an elder tree, I do not dare breathe",
    "Or move.",
    "I listen.",
    "The wheat leans back toward its own darkness,",
    "And I lean toward mine."
