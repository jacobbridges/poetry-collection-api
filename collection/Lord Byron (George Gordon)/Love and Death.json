    "I watched thee when the foe was at our side,",
    "Ready to strike at him\u2014or thee and me,",
    "Were safety hopeless\u2014rather than divide",
    "Aught with one loved save love and liberty.",
    "I watched thee on the breakers, when the rock,",
    "Received our prow, and all was storm and fear,",
    "And bade thee cling to me through every shock;",
    "This arm would be thy bark, or breast thy bier.",
    "I watched thee when the fever glazed thine eyes,",
    "Yielding my couch and stretched me on the ground",
    "When overworn with watching, ne\u2019er to rise",
    "From thence if thou an early grave hadst found.",
    "The earthquake came, and rocked the quivering wall,",
    "And men and nature reeled as if with wine.",
    "Whom did I seek around the tottering hall?",
    "For thee. Whose safety first provide for? Thine.",
    "And when convulsive throes denied my breath",
    "The faintest utterance to my fading thought,",
    "To thee\u2014to thee\u2014e\u2019en in the gasp of death",
    "My spirit turned, oh! oftener than it ought.",
    "Thus much and more; and yet thou lov\u2019st me not,",
    "And never wilt! Love dwells not in our will.",
    "Nor can I blame thee, though it be my lot",
    "To strongly, wrongly, vainly love thee still."
