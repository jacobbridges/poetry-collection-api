    "His classic studies made a little puzzle,",
    "Because of filthy loves of gods and goddesses,",
    "Who in the earlier ages raised a bustle,",
    "But never put on pantaloons or bodices;",
    "His reverend tutors had at times a tussle,",
    "And for their Aeneids, Iliads, and Odysseys,",
    "Were forced to make an odd sort of apology,",
    "For Donna Inez dreaded the mythology.",
    "Ovid's a rake, as half his verses show him,",
    "Anacreon's morals are a still worse sample,",
    "Catullus scarcely has a decent poem,",
    "I don't think Sappho's Ode a good example,",
    "Although Longinus tells us there is no hymn",
    "Where the sublime soars forth on wings more ample:",
    "But Virgil's songs are pure, except that horrid one",
    "Beginning with '",
    ".'"
