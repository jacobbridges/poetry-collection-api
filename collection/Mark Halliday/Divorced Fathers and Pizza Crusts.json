    "The connection between divorced fathers and pizza crusts",
    "is understandable. The divorced father does not cook",
    "confidently. He wants his kid to enjoy dinner.",
    "The entire weekend is supposed to be fun. Kids love",
    "pizza. For some reason involving soft warmth and malleability",
    "kids approve of melted cheese on pizza",
    "years before they will tolerate cheese in other situations.",
    "So the divorced father takes the kid and the kid's friend",
    "out for pizza. The kids eat much faster than the dad.",
    "Before the dad has finished his second slice,",
    "the kids are playing a video game or being Ace Ventura",
    "or blowing spitballs through straws, making this hail",
    "that can't quite be cleaned up. There are four slices left",
    "and the divorced father doesn't want them wasted,",
    "there has been enough waste already; he sits there",
    "in his windbreaker finishing the pizza. It's good",
    "except the crust is actually not so great\u2014",
    "after the second slice the crust is basically a chore\u2014",
    "so you leave it. You move on to the next loaded slice.",
    "Finally there you are amid rims of crust.",
    "All this is understandable. There's no dark conspiracy.",
    "Meanwhile the kids are having a pretty good time",
    "which is the whole point. So the entire evening makes",
    "clear sense. Now the divorced father gathers",
    "the sauce-stained napkins for the trash and dumps them",
    "and dumps the rims of crust which are not",
    "corpses on a battlefield. Understandability",
    "fills the pizza shop so thoroughly there's no room",
    "for anything else. Now he's at the door summoning the kids",
    "and they follow, of course they do, he's a dad."
