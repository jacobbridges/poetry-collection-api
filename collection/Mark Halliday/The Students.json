    "The students eat something and then watch the news,",
    "a little, then go to sleep. When morning breaks in",
    "they find they have not forgotten all: they recall",
    "the speckle of words on certain pages of",
    "the chapter assigned, a phrase of strange weight",
    "from a chapter that was not assigned, and something",
    "said almost flippantly by a classmate on the Green",
    "which put much of the 18th century into perspective.",
    "Noticing themselves at the sink they are aware",
    "the hands they wash are the \"same\" hands",

    "presently, glance at another corner of the space:",
    "that was where we mostly sat two years ago,",
    "that was where Gerry said what he said",
    "about circles, the concept of, and Leonardo da Vinci."
