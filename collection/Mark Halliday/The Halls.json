    "Five more books in a box to be carried out to the car;",
    "your office door closes behind you and at that moment",
    "you turn invisible\u2014not even a ghost in that hall",
    "from the hall\u2019s point of view.",
    "If the halls don\u2019t know you, the halls and the rooms",
    "of the buildings where you worked for seven years\u2014",
    "if the halls don\u2019t know you,",
    "and they don\u2019t\u2014",
    "some new woman or two new men come clattering",
    "down these halls in the month after your departure, indeed",
    "just two days after you left forever",
    "they come clattering with ideas about",
    "the relation between mind and body or will and fate",
    "filled with hormones of being the chosen workers here",
    "and they feel as if the halls and rooms begin to recognize them,",
    "accept them, as if there is a belonging in the world\u2014",
    "but these new workers are wrong, the halls don\u2019t know",
    "who is working under the unobtrusive fluorescent panels:",
    "this is appalling and for a minute you are appalled",
    "though your being so now is not an event",
    "in the life of your new rented house or even",
    "your new condominium . . .",
    "So if they don\u2019t, if they don\u2019t know you,",
    "the halls, the walls, the fixtures,",
    "then what? Then there is for you",
    "no home in that rock, no home in the mere rock of",
    "where you work, where you briskly walk, not even",
    "in the bed where your body sleeps alone or not\u2014",
    "so if there is to be a place for you, for you",
    "it must not be located in plaster and tile and space,",
    "it will have to be in that other house,",
    "the one whose door you felt opening just last night",
    "when you dialed from memory and your friend picked up the phone."
