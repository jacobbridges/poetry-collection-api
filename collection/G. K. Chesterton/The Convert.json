    "After one moment when I bowed my head",
    "And the whole world turned over and came upright,",
    "And I came out where the old road shone white.",
    "I walked the ways and heard what all men said,",
    "Forests of tongues, like autumn leaves unshed,",
    "Being not unlovable but strange and light;",
    "Old riddles and new creeds, not in despite",
    "But softly, as men smile about the dead",
    "The sages have a hundred maps to give",
    "That trace their crawling cosmos like a tree,",
    "They rattle reason out through many a sieve",
    "That stores the sand and lets the gold go free:",
    "And all these things are less than dust to me",
    "Because my name is Lazarus and I live."
