    "1",
    "The reservoir is trying to freeze over",
    "with an expanding map shaped like an angel",
    "Separated lovers on a coast keep walking",
    "toward each other. Low sun reddens",
    "their faces without heat",
    "They are weary of always moving",
    "so seldom touching, but never think",
    "to move inland, massive and stable",
    "Imagoes hatched on thin ice, it\u2019s",
    "their illusion membranes are brighter",
    "than occluded flesh of interiors",
    "Membranes have the density",
    "of an edge, and edges violent as lava",
    "2",
    "All day she walked across the tundra",
    "He began to drive away obliquely",
    "at exactly her speed, so she altered",
    "her angle, aiming above him, as in a current",
    "He departed in a zone that solidified",
    "at his whim, so she reached for his hand",
    "Land cracked with their weight. He seemed",
    "to reach toward her, a hand like paper",
    "twisted and folded over, only a surface",
    "with wan modulations, like a map",
    "3",
    "Then she delicately stepped out",
    "toward the edge, tenuous as a leaf",
    "as if waiting for a letter",
    "but it froze too swiftly before her",
    "At dusk his voice broke her concentration",
    "She turned, vexed, and saw he had not spoken."
