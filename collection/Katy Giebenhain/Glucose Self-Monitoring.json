    "A stabbing in miniature, it is,",
    "a tiny crime,",
    "my own blood parceled",
    "drop by drop and set",
    "on the flickering tongue",
    "of this machine.",
    "It is the spout-punching of trees",
    "for syrup new and smooth",
    "and sweeter",
    "than nature ever intended.",
    "It is Sleeping Beauty's curse",
    "and fascination.",
    "It is the dipstick measuring of oil",
    "from the Buick's throat,",
    "the necessary maintenance.",
    "It is every vampire movie ever made.",
    "Hand, my martyr without lips,",
    "my quiet cow.",
    "I'll milk your fingertips",
    "for all they're worth.",
    "For what they're worth.",
    "Something like a harvest, it is,",
    "a tiny crime."
