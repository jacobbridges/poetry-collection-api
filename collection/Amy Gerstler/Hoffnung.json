    "He fancies his chances are good with her,",
    "unaware that in the years since the war",
    "she has come to prefer women whose cunts",
    "taste like mustard. To pin one\u2019s hopes on",
    "a bark-colored moth, its wings crinkled",
    "like crepe paper, a moth affixed high",
    "on the kitchen wall, frozen for days where",
    "it will likely die in noble clinging mode",
    "just under the cobwebby heating vent,",
    "is to confirm your need for more friends",
    "and a greater daily quota of sunlight.",
    "To raise C.\u2019s hopes that T. can stop",
    "drinking and then to liken those",
    "hopes to fields of undulating grain,",
    "alfalfa perhaps, is to wish C. hip deep",
    "in acres of unscythed denial. The blind",
    "typist hopes she\u2019ll be hired tonight without",
    "her disability becoming an issue. L. said he felt",
    "hope\u2019s rhizomes race throughout his body,",
    "radiating in all directions, like some incipient",
    "disease he\u2019d been fighting since childhood.",
    "Hope, he said, it\u2019s as insidious as bitterness.",
    "If mother earth only knew how much we",
    "loved one another she would creak, shudder,",
    "and split like a macheted melon, releasing",
    "the fiery ball of molten hope at her core."
