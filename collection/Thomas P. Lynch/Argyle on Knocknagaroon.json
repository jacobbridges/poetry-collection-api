    "Because he barely heard the voice of God",
    "above the hum of other choristers\u2014",
    "batwing and bird-whistle, gathering thunder,",
    "the hiss of tides retreating, children, cattle;",
    "because he could not readily discern",
    "the plan Whoever Is In Charge Here has,",
    "he wondered about those who claimed to have",
    "blessed assurances or certainty:",
    "a One and Only Way and Truth and Life,",
    "as if Whatever Breathes in Everything",
    "mightn\u2019t speak in every wondrous tongue;",
    "as if, of all creations, only one",
    "made any sense. It made no sense to him.",
    "Hunger he understood, touch, desire.",
    "He knew the tenderness humans could do,",
    "no less brutalities. He knew the cold",
    "morning, the broad meadow, the gold sunset.",
    "One evening on the hill of Knocknagaroon,",
    "the Atlantic on one side, the Shannon",
    "on the other, the narrowing headlands",
    "of the peninsula out behind him,",
    "the broad green palm of Moveen before him,",
    "it seemed he occupied the hand of God:",
    "open, upturned, outstretched, uplifting him."
