    "I woke. A tiny knot of skin on a silver table",
    "Set in the birth-theater, blinking in the glare",
    "Of electric lights and a strange arranged",
    "Passel of faces: huge as gods in their council.",
    "I was the actor who forgets his lines and enters",
    "On stage suddenly wanting to say,",
    "I was almost all eye: they weighed me down,",
    "Two lump-big brown-sugar bags in a face",
    "Which did not yet know struggle, burden;",
    "How the look of newborns unnerves. Then",
    "They wrapped me in pale yellow like a new sun",
    "Still too small to throw up into the sky.",
    "It was midnight when they injected me",
    "With a plague; tamed, faded as imperialism, pox",
    "Had once put its palm-leaf hand over a quarter of Earth",
    "Saying,",
    ". Now it was contracted to a drop:",
    "And in the morning I knew both death and life.",
    "Lapped in my nimbus of old gold light, my",
    "Huge lashes drooped over my deepened eyes, like",
    "Ostrich-feather shades over twin crown princes: wet heads",
    "Sleek and doomed as the black soul of an open poppy."
