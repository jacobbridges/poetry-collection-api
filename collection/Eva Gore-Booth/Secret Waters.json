    "Lo, in my soul there lies a hidden lake,",
    "High in the mountains, fed by rain and snow,",
    "The sudden thundering avalanche divine,",
    "And the bright waters\u2019 everlasting flow,",
    "Far from the highways\u2019 dusty glare and heat.",
    "Dearer it is and holier, for Christ\u2019s sake,",
    "Than his own windy lake in Palestine,",
    "For there the little boats put out to sea",
    "Without him, and no fisher hears his call,",
    "Yea, on the desolate shores of Galilee",
    "No man again shall see his shadow fall.",
    "Yet here the very voice of the one Light",
    "Haunts with sharp ecstasy each little wind",
    "That stirs still waters on a moonlit night,",
    "And sings through high trees growing in the mind,",
    "And makes a gentle rustling in the wheat. . . .",
    "Yea, in the white dawn on this happy shore,",
    "With the lake water washing at his feet,",
    "He stands alive and radiant evermore,",
    "Whose presence makes the very East wind kind,",
    "And turns to heaven the soul\u2019s green-lit retreat."
