    "I was ready for a new experience.",
    "All the old ones had burned out.",
    "They lay in little ashy heaps along the roadside",
    "And blew in drifts across the fairgrounds and fields.",
    "From a distance some appeared to be smoldering",
    "But when I approached with my hat in my hands",
    "They let out small puffs of smoke and expired.",
    "Through the windows of houses I saw lives lit up",
    "With the otherworldly glow of TV",
    "And these were smoking a little bit too.",
    "I flew to Rome. I flew to Greece.",
    "I sat on a rock in the shade of the Acropolis",
    "And conjured dusky columns in the clouds.",
    "I watched waves lap the crumbling coast.",
    "I heard wind strip the woods.",
    "I saw the last living snow leopard",
    "Pacing in the dirt. Experience taught me",
    "That nothing worth doing is worth doing",
    "For the sake of experience alone.",
    "I bit into an apple that tasted sweetly of time.",
    "The sun came out. It was the old sun",
    "With only a few billion years left to shine."
