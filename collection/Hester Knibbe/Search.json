    "Wandered tonight through a city",
    "as ruined as a body with broken",
    "ribs and a bared heart. Looked for you",
    "there with cookies in my pocket, searched",
    "for a sigh, for movement in demolished",
    "streets and alleys. Tonight",
    "since I\u2019d forgotten for a moment where you are,",
    "I searched for you with hope in my bones.",
    "But no matter how I lured you with my voice",
    "and my eyes, walls of debris",
    "grew up steadily around you, cellars seemed",
    "to creep around you. I remained alone",
    "with those cookies in my pocket",
    "and kept calling and walking."
