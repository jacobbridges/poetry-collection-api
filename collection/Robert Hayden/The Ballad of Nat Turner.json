    "Then fled, O brethren, the wicked juba",
    "and wandered wandered far",
    "from curfew joys in the Dismal\u2019s night.",
    "Fool of St. Elmo\u2019s fire",
    "In scary night I wandered, praying,",
    "Lord God my harshener,",
    "speak to me now or let me die;",
    "speak, Lord, to this mourner.",
    "And came at length to livid trees",
    "where Ibo warriors",
    "hung shadowless, turning in wind",
    "that moaned like Africa,",
    "Their belltongue bodies dead, their eyes",
    "alive with the anger deep",
    "in my own heart. Is this the sign,",
    "the sign forepromised me?",
    "The spirits vanished. Afraid and lonely",
    "I wandered on in blackness.",
    "Speak to me now or let me die.",
    "Die, whispered the blackness.",
    "And wild things gasped and scuffled in",
    "the night; seething shapes",
    "of evil frolicked upon the air.",
    "I reeled with fear, I prayed.",
    "Sudden brightness clove the preying",
    "darkness, brightness that was",
    "itself a golden darkness, brightness",
    "so bright that it was darkness.",
    "And there were angels, their faces hidden",
    "from me, angels at war",
    "with one another, angels in dazzling",
    "combat. And oh the splendor,",
    "The fearful splendor of that warring.",
    "Hide me, I cried to rock and bramble.",
    "Hide me, the rock, the bramble cried. . . .",
    "How tell you of that holy battle?",
    "The shock of wing on wing and sword",
    "on sword was the tumult of",
    "a taken city burning. I cannot",
    "say how long they strove,",
    "For the wheel in a turning wheel which is time",
    "in eternity had ceased",
    "its whirling, and owl and moccasin,",
    "panther and nameless beast",
    "And I were held like creatures fixed",
    "in flaming, in fiery amber.",
    "But I saw I saw oh many of",
    "those mighty beings waver,",
    "Waver and fall, go streaking down",
    "into swamp water, and the water",
    "hissed and steamed and bubbled and locked",
    "shuddering shuddering over",
    "The fallen and soon was motionless.",
    "Then that massive light",
    "began a-folding slowly in",
    "upon itself, and I",
    "Beheld the conqueror faces and, lo,",
    "they were like mine, I saw",
    "they were like mine and in joy and terror",
    "wept, praising praising Jehovah.",
    "Oh praised my honer, harshener",
    "till a sleep came over me,",
    "a sleep heavy as death. And when",
    "I awoke at last free",
    "And purified, I rose and prayed",
    "and returned after a time",
    "to the blazing fields, to the humbleness.",
    "And bided my time."
