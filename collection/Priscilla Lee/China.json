    "On our dining table, every dish is a dime-store pattern:",
    "blue dandelions, red nasturtiums, the entire stack,",
    "a small legacy won in a 1959 coin toss",
    "by Lealand, the uncle with the long arms",
    "and legs, who pitched penny after penny",
    "at a parking lot carnival until his pockets",
    "were emptied of everything, but lint and luck.",
    "My family wouldn't buy Emporium bowls",
    "thick like heads of cabbage or soup spoons",
    "holding hand-painted water lilies;",
    "our plates, chipped and resounding,",
    "clatter at every feast. In America,",
    "we acquired what was necessary:",
    "some English to earn a living, cotton",
    "for dull work, enough noodles for a long life.",
    "My father and uncles fled China",
    "with a black leather trunk, four wool sweaters,",
    "and proud photographs of their two-story mansion.",
    "They rented on Mason, Alfred's Steakhouse clanging",
    "all night below. Great-Uncle's wife",
    "donated a lazy susan, mini Bora Bora",
    "pitchforks, and wooden bowls, rancid",
    "from salad oil\u2014whatever she couldn't unload",
    "at her yard sale. Sundays, she invited",
    "her nephews to hang coats, change diapers,",
    "and serve finger sandwiches, told guests,",
    "The boys didn't tell her about the jars of jade",
    "or the \"big house,\" its pond",
    "swimming with yolk-eating carp.",
    "They studied calculus and chemistry",
    "and worked after school, eighty-five cents an hour,",
    "pouring coffee at Mee Heung Bakery",
    "and ironing pleats in sweat shops",
    "towards a new life: chicken and fresh fish",
    "every day, wonton noodle soup and television",
    "at midnight, Grace Kelly on weekends.",
    "my father says",
    "as he watches Uncle Lealand, the organoleptic specialist, dish up",
    "the leftover black bean lobster for his cats."
