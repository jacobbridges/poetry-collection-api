    "While Lucullus raided cherry orchards,",
    "he left us to besiege,",
    "grudgingly, this outlander fortress,",
    "named for an Amazon queen,",
    "while thinking of food and home.",
    "Not one of us has seen",
    "a single horse-borne warrior woman.",
    "Meanwhile, we dug a tomb.",
    "We intended it as the tunnel",
    "through which we\u2019d claim the fort.",
    "We shored up the sifting roof",
    "and dug by lamps",
    "that shed more shadows than light.",
    "At last we formed up underground",
    "to attack with sword and fire,",
    "but the enemy tossed in hives,",
    "and in a cloud of stinging bees",
    "our torches jerked and swung or fell",
    "so we could hardly tell",
    "where to strike, or what, for next",
    "our enemy sent weasels in, and foxes,",
    "which seemed to be done in jest",
    "until we felt their teeth",
    "and heard, more than saw, the larger beasts.",
    "A wolf began my death.",
    "I lay in men\u2019s and weasels\u2019 blood",
    "and heard the body",
    "that dropped at my side",
    "ask,",
    "of thoughtless creatures weapons of war?",
    "But a flung torch showed me the face",
    "of a bear that said nothing, and died.",
    "Then came the boar."
