    "I couldn't have waited. By the time you return",
    "it would have rotted on the vine.",
    "So I cut the first tomato into eighths,",
    "salted the pieces in the dusk",
    "and found the flesh not mealy (like last year's)",
    "or bitter,",
    "even when I swallowed the green crown of the stem",
    "that made my throat feel dusty and warm.",
    "Pah. I could have gagged on the sweetness.",
    "The miser accused by her red sums.",
    "Better had I eaten the dirt itself",
    "on this the first night in my life",
    "when I have not been too busy for my loneliness\u2014",
    "at last, it comes."
