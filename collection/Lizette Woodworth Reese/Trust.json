    "I am thy grass, O Lord!",
    "I grow up sweet and tall",

    "Love will not let me be;",
    "Love holds me here; Love cuts me down;",
    "And it is well with me.",
    "Lord, Love, keep it but so;",
    "Thy purpose is full plain;",
    "I die that after I may grow",
    "As tall, as sweet again."
