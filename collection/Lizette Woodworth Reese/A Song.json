    "Oh, Love, he went a-straying,",
    "A long time ago!",
    "I missed him in the Maying,",
    "When blossoms were of snow;",
    "So back I came by the old sweet way;",
    "And for I loved him so, wept that he came not with me,",
    "A long time ago!",
    "Wide open stood my chamber door,",
    "And one stepped forth to greet;",
    "Gray Grief, strange Grief, who turned me sore",
    "With words he spake so sweet.",
    "I gave him meat; I gave him drink;",
    "(And listened for Love\u2019s feet.)",
    "How many years? I cannot think;",
    "In truth, I do not know\u2014",
    "Ah, long time ago!",
    "Oh, love, he came not back again,",
    "Although I kept me fair;",
    "And each white May, in field and lane,",
    "I waited for him there!",
    "Yea, he forgot; but Grief stayed on,",
    "And in Love\u2019s empty chair",
    "Doth sit and tell of days long gone\u2014",
    "\u2019Tis more than I can bear!"
