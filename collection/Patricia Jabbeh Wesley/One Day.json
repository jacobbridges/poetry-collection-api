    "One day, you will awake from your covering",
    "and that heart of yours will be totally mended,",
    "and there will be no more burning within.",
    "The owl, calling in the setting of the sun",
    "and the deer path, all erased.",
    "And there will be no more need for love",
    "or lovers or fears of losing lovers",
    "and there will be no more burning timbers",
    "with which to light a new fire,",
    "and there will be no more husbands or people",
    "related to husbands, and there will be no more",
    "tears or reason to shed your tears.",
    "You will be as mended as the bridge",
    "the working crew has just reopened.",
    "The thick air will be vanquished with the tide",
    "and the river that was corrupted by lies",
    "will be cleansed and totally free.",
    "And the rooster will call in the setting sun",
    "and the sun will beckon homeward,",
    "hiding behind your one tree that was not felled."
