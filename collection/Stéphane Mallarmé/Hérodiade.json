    "I. ANCIENT OVERTURE OF H\u00c9\ufeffRODIADE",
    "The Nurse",
    "Abolished, and her frightful wing in the tears",
    "Of the basin, abolished, that mirrors forth our fears,",
    "The naked golds lashing the crimson space,",
    "An Aurora\u2014heraldic plumage\u2014has chosen to embrace",
    "Our cinerary tower of sacrifice,",
    "Heavy tomb that a songbird has fled, lone caprice",
    "Of a dawn vainly decked out in ebony plumes\u2026",
    "Ah, mansion this sad, fallen country assumes!",
    "No splashing! the gloomy water, standing still,",
    "No longer visited by snowy quill",
    "Or fabled swan, reflects the bereaving",
    "Of autumn extinguished by its own unleaving,",
    "Of the swan when amidst the cold white tomb",
    "Of its feathers, it buried its head, undone",
    "By the pure diamond of a star, but one",
    "Of long ago, which never even shone.",
    "Crime! torture! ancient dawn! bright pyre!",
    "Empurpled sky, complicit in the mire,",
    "And stained-glass windows opening red on carnage.",
    "The strange chamber, framed in all the baggage",
    "Of a warlike age, its goldwork dull and faint,",
    "Has yesteryear\u2019s snows instead of its ancient tint;",
    "And its pearl-gray tapestry, useless creases",
    "With the buried eyes of prophetesses",
    "Offering Magi withered fingers. One,",
    "With floral past enwoven on my gown",
    "Bleached in an ivory chest and with a sky",
    "Bestrewn with birds amidst the embroidery",
    "Of tarnished silver, seems a phantom risen,",
    "An aroma, roses, rising from the hidden",
    "Couch, now void, the snuffed-out candle shrouds,",
    "An aroma, over the sachet, of frozen golds,",
    "A drift of flowers unfaithful to the moon",
    "(Though the taper\u2019s quenched, petals still fall from one),",
    "Flowers whose long regrets and stems appear",
    "Drenched in a lonely vase to languish there\u2026",
    "An Aurora dragged her wings in the basin\u2019s tears!",
    "Magical shadow with symbolic powers!",
    "A voice from the distant past, an evocation,",
    "Is it not mine prepared for incantation?",
    "In the yellow folds of thought, still unexhumed,",
    "Lingering, and like an antique cloth perfumed,",
    "Spread on a pile of monstrances grown cold,",
    "Through ancient hollows and through stiffened folds",
    "Pierced in the rhythm of the pure lace shroud",
    "Through which the old veiled brightness is allowed",
    "To mount, in desperation, shall arise",
    "(But oh, the distance hidden in those cries!)",
    "The old veiled brightness of a strange gilt-silver,",
    "Of the languishing voice, estranged and unfamiliar:",
    "Will it scatter its gold in an ultimate splendor,",
    "And, in the hour of its agony, render",
    "Itself as the anthem for psalms of petition?",
    "For all are alike in being brought to perdition",
    "By the power of old silence and deepening gloom,",
    "Fated, monotonous, vanquished, undone,",
    "Like the sluggish waters of an ancient pond.",
    "Sometimes she sang an incoherent song.",
    "Lamentable sign!",
    "the bed of vellum sheets,",
    "Useless and closed\u2013not linen!\u2014vainly waits,",
    "Bereft now of the cherished grammary",
    "That spelled the figured folds of reverie,",
    "The silken tent that harbored memory,",
    "The fragrance of sleeping hair. Were these its treasure?",
    "Cold child, she held within her subtle pleasure,",
    "Shivering with flowers in her walks at dawn,",
    "Or when the pomegranate\u2019s flesh is torn",
    "By wicked night! Alone, the crescent moon",
    "On the iron clockface is a pendulum",
    "Suspending Lucifer: the clepsydra pours",
    "Dark drops in grief upon the stricken hours",
    "As, wounded, each one wanders a dim shade",
    "On undeciphered paths without a guide!",
    "All this the king knows not, whose salary",
    "Has fed so long this ag",
    "d breast now dry.",
    "Her father knows it no more than the cruel",
    "Glacier mirroring his arms of steel,",
    "When sprawled on a pile of corpses without coffins",
    "Smelling obscurely of resin, he deafens",
    "With dark silver trumpets the ancient pines!",
    "Will he ever come back from the Cisalpines?",
    "Soon enough! for all is bad dream and foreboding!",
    "On the fingernail raised in the stained glass, according",
    "To the memory of the trumpets, the old sky burns,",
    "And to an envious candle it turns",
    "A finger. And soon, when the sad sun sinks,",
    "It shall pierce through the body of wax till it shrinks!",
    "No sunset, but the red awakening",
    "Of the last day concluding everything",
    "Struggles so sadly that time disappears,",
    "The redness of apocalypse, whose tears",
    "Fall on the child, exiled to her own proud",
    "Heart, as the swan makes its plumage a shroud",
    "For its eyes, the old swan, and is carried away",
    "From the plumage of grief to the eternal highway",
    "Of its hopes, where it looks on the diamonds divine",
    "Of a moribund star, which never more shall shine!"
