    "A linear projection: a route. It crosses",
    "The ocean in many ships. Arriving in the new",
    "Land, it cuts through and down forests and it",
    "Keeps moving. Terrain: Rock, weaponry.",
    "Dark trees, mastery. Grass, to yield. Earth,",
    "Reproachful. Fox, bear, coon, wildcat",
    "Prowl gloomily, it kills them, it skins them,",
    "Its language alters, no account varmint, its",
    "Teeth set, nothing defeats its obsession, it becomes",
    "A snake in the reedy river. Spits and prays,",
    "Keeps moving. Behind it, a steel track. Cold,",
    "Permanent. Not permanent. It will decay. This",
    "Does not matter, it does not actually care,",

    "Severed, irrecoverably torn, that does not matter,",
    "It decides, perpendicular from here: escape.",
    "A prior circle: a mouth. It is nowhere,",
    "Everywhere, swollen, warm. Expanding and contracting",
    "It absorbs and projects children, jungles,",
    "Black shoes, pennies, blood. It speaks",
    "Too many dark, suffering languages. Reaching a hand",
    "Toward its throat, you disappear entirely. No",
    "Wonder you fear this bleeding pulse, no wonder."
