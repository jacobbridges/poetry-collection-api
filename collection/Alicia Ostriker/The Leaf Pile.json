    "Now here is a typical children\u2019s story",
    "that happens in gorgeous October",
    "when the mothers are coming",
    "in the afternoon, wearing brisk boots",
    "and windy skirts to pick up",
    "the little children from the day care center",
    "Frost in the air",
    "the maples golden and crimson",
    "my son in a leaf pile in the playground dreaming",
    "I am late, the playground is almost",
    "empty, my husband will kill me",
    "I gather my son to go home,",
    "he forgets his sweater in the playground and I send him back",
    "he dawdles, he is playing with leaves",
    "in his mind, it is already a quarter",
    "to six, will you come on I say",
    "and hurry along the corridor, there are yellow and blue rocket",
    "paintings, but I feel bad and ask what did you do today,",
    "do you recognize this story, the way he stands and picks",
    "his nose, move I say, do you want dinner or not",
    "I\u2019m going to make a nice dinner, fried chicken",
    "I wheedle, so could you please walk a little",
    "faster, okay, I walk a little faster and get upstairs",
    "myself, pivot on boot-heel, nobody there,",
    "he is putting something in his mouth, his sable eyelashes",
    "downcast, and I am swooping down the stairwell screaming",
    "damn you",
    "that\u2019s filthy",
    "I told you not before dinner",
    "We are climbing the stairs",
    "and I am crying, my son is not crying",
    "I have shaken him, I have pried the sweet from his cheek",
    "I have slapped his cheek like a woman slapping a carpet",
    "with all my strength",
    "mothers are very strong",
    "he is too young to do anything about this",
    "will not remember he remembers it",
    "The mind is a leaf pile where you can bury",
    "anything, pain, the image of a woman",
    "who wears a necklace of skulls, a screaming woman",
    "you dig quickly and deposit the pulpy thing",
    "you drop leaves on it and it stays there, that is the story",
    "that is sticking in my mind as we push",
    "the exit door, and run through the evening wind",
    "to my car where I jerk the gearshift and pick",
    "up a little speed, going along",
    "this neat suburban avenue full of maples",
    "the mark of my hand a blush on my son\u2019s cheek."
