    "They remember the dead who died in the resistance.",
    "It is in sweet tones that they speak of them.",
    "They shake their heads, still, after the dinner",
    "Walking back to the car, while an evening snow",
    "That has started windlessly, white from pearl-gray,",
    "Falls into streets that are already slushy.",
    "They shake their heads, as we do when there is something",
    "Too strange to believe,",
    "Or as a beast does, stunned by a blow.",
    "\u201cTo die in the resistance,\u201d they say, \u201cis to fail",
    "To turn into slush, to escape this ugliness.",
    "It is at once to leap, a creamy swan,",
    "Upward.\u201d Three voices: oboe, piano, cello.",
    "The high one wishes to be pleasing, the middle",
    "To be practical, the deep to persevere.",
    "A movie theater lobby in front of them",
    "Throws its light on the sidewalk, like a woman",
    "Swiftly emptying a bucket of water:",
    "The flakes are falling in its yellow light.",
    "Then they pass a caf\u00e9, its light red neon,",
    "Then a closed pharmacy.",
    "\u2014They pull sharp air",
    "Into their lungs, a pain that is a pleasure.",
    "\u201cTry to live as if there were no God,\u201d",
    "They don\u2019t say, but they mean.",
    "A recollection of purity, a clean",
    "Handkerchief each man feels in his own pocket,",
    "Perturbs them, slows their pace down. Now they have seen",
    "A yellow stain on a pile of old snow",
    "Between two parked cars, where a man has peed:",
    "The resistance. The falling flakes, falling",
    "On the men\u2019s hats. And now",
    "The snow grows heavier, falls on their stooping shoulders."
