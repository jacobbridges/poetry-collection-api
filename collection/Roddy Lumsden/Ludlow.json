    "An inch from the curse and pearled",
    "by the evening heat I shake",
    "my polo neck and a cool draught",
    "buffs my chest. What rises is",
    "my animal aroma the scent",
    "of blue-ribbon stock the sort",
    "a starred chef would ladle from",
    "a zinc-bottomed pan to soften",
    "and savor the hock he has sawn",
    "and roasted for the diners out front",
    "who sip at shots of pastis and gnaw",
    "around the pits of kalamata olives.",
    "My head",
    "sits in his fridge: stooping for herb",
    "butter, our eyes meet and he touches",
    "my cotton-cold face just as once",
    "I stroked your cheek in a dream",
    "you suffered in a room above the river."
