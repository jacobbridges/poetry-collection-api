    "Lame again, I limp home along Lawn Terrace",
    "with a flowering sun star in a paper wrap",
    "then back to the village with a lame cat",
    "twisting and woeful in her cage.",
    "Bread these days isn't baked to last:",
    "how sad those posh loaves thudding off",
    "in pine breadbins all around the Heath:",
    "soulless latterday pets, frisky for a day",
    "or two, then binned or thrown to foxes,",
    "loaves just an inch of gloom below",
    "the caged birds you notice in corners",
    "of those same mansions when you seek",
    "the past, dinking their mirrors, dipping",
    "once in a while for a sip of milk."
