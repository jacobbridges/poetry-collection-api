    "as the great, the grim and the gone pressed terrible flesh,",
    "so many penguins offering tastesome wisps and skimps",
    "from doilied salvers: cherry-shaded caviar, cheese puffs,",
    "dark sugared berries, dainty octopods, gently vinegared,",
    "with not enough tentacles to count the capes and stoles,",

    "we tore out onto Jermyn Street, along which I performed",
    "a sort of shuffle, one eye on the book and one on m\u2019lady\u2019s",
