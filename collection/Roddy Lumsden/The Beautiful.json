    "Into perplexity: as an itch chased round",
    "an oxter or early man in the cave mouth",
    "watching rain-drifts pour from beyond",
    "his understanding. Whether to admire",
    "the mere sensation, enough, or hold out",
    "for sweeter ornament, vessels of wonder",
    "born with that ur-charm of symmetry;",
    "lovely ones we ache to prize and praise,",
    "climb into and become because they try",
    "our day-by-day significance: some of us",
    "ugly and most of us plain, walked past",
    "in the drowned streets: pearls of paste,",
    "salted butter, secondary colors. They",
    "drift unapproached, gazed never-selves,",
    "blunt paragons of genetic industry. We",
    "desire them but cannot want such order.",
    "We stand, mouths open, and cannot help",
    "stammering our secrets, nailed to water."
