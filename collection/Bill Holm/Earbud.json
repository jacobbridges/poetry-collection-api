    "Earbud\u2014a tiny marble sheathed in foam",
    "to wear like an interior earring so you",
    "can enjoy private noises wherever you go,",
    "protected from any sudden silence.",
    "Only check your batteries, then copy",
    "a thousand secret songs and stories",
    "on the tiny pod you carry in your pocket.",
    "You are safe now from other noises made",
    "by other people, other machines, by chance,",
    "noises you have not chosen as your own.",
    "To get your attention, I touch your arm",
    "to show you the tornado or the polar bear.",
    "Sometimes I catch you humming or talking to the air",
    "as if to a shrunken lover waiting in your ear."
