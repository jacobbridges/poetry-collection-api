    "Start with the square heavy loaf",
    "steamed a whole day in a hot spring",
    "until the coarse rye, sugar, yeast",
    "grow dense as a black hole of bread.",
    "Let it age and dry a little,",
    "then soak the old loaf for a day",
    "in warm water flavored",
    "with raisins and lemon slices.",
    "Boil it until it is thick as molasses.",
    "Pour it in a flat white bowl.",
    "Ladle a good dollop of whipped cream",
    "to melt in its brown belly.",
    "This soup is alive as any animal,",
    "and the yeast and cream and rye",
    "will sing inside you after eating",
    "for a long time."
