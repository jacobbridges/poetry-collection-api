    "Shorter and shorter now the twilight clips",
    "The days, as though the sunset gates they crowd,",
    "And Summer from her golden collar slips",
    "And strays through stubble-fields, and moans aloud,",
    "Save when by fits the warmer air deceives,",
    "And, stealing hopeful to some sheltered bower,",
    "She lies on pillows of the yellow leaves,",
    "And tries the old tunes over for an hour.",
    "The wind, whose tender whisper in the May",
    "Set all the young blooms listening through th\u2019 grove,",
    "Sits rustling in the faded boughs to-day",
    "And makes his cold and unsuccessful love.",
    "The rose has taken off her tire of red\u2014",
    "The mullein-stalk its yellow stars have lost,",
    "And the proud meadow-pink hangs down her head",
    "Against earth\u2019s chilly bosom, witched with frost.",
    "The robin, that was busy all the June,",
    "Before the sun had kissed the topmost bough,",
    "Catching our hearts up in his golden tune,",
    "Has given place to the brown cricket now.",
    "The very cock crows lonesomely at morn\u2014",
    "Each flag and fern the shrinking stream divides\u2014",
    "Uneasy cattle low, and lambs forlorn",
    "Creep to their strawy sheds with nettled sides.",
    "Shut up the door: who loves me must not look",
    "Upon the withered world, but haste to bring",
    "His lighted candle, and his story-book,",
    "And live with me the poetry of Spring."
