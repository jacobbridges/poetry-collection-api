    "Have you been in our wild west country? then",
    "You have often had to pass",
    "Its cabins lying like birds\u2019 nests in",
    "The wild green prairie grass.",
    "Have you seen the women forget their wheels",
    "As they sat at the door to spin\u2014",
    "Have you seen the darning fall away",
    "From their fingers worn and thin,",
    "As they asked you news of the villages",
    "Where they were used to be,",
    "Gay girls at work in the factories",
    "With their lovers gone to sea!",
    "Ah, have you thought of the bravery",
    "That no loud praise provokes\u2014",
    "Of the tragedies acted in the lives",
    "Of poor, hard-working folks!",
    "Of the little more, and the little more",
    "Of hardship which they press",
    "Upon their own tired hands to make",
    "The toil for the children less:",
    "And not in vain; for many a lad",
    "Born to rough work and ways,",
    "Strips off his ragged coat, and makes",
    "Men clothe him with their praise."
