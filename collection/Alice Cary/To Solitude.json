    "I am weary of the working,",
    "Weary of the long day\u2019s heat;",
    "To thy comfortable bosom,",
    "Wilt thou take me, spirit sweet?",
    "Weary of the long, blind struggle",
    "For a pathway bright and high,\u2014",
    "Weary of the dimly dying",
    "Hopes that never quite all die.",
    "Weary searching a bad cipher",
    "For a good that must be meant;",
    "Discontent with being weary,\u2014",
    "Weary with my discontent.",
    "I am weary of the trusting",
    "Where my trusts but torments prove;",
    "Wilt thou keep faith with me? wilt thou",
    "Be my true and tender love?",
    "I am weary drifting, driving",
    "Like a helmless bark at sea;",
    "Kindly, comfortable spirit,",
    "Wilt thou give thyself to me?",
    "Give thy birds to sing me sonnets?",
    "Give thy winds my cheeks to kiss?",
    "And thy mossy rocks to stand for",
    "The memorials of our bliss?",
    "I in reverence will hold thee,",
    "Never vexed with jealous ills,",
    "Though thy wild and wimpling waters",
    "Wind about a thousand hills."
