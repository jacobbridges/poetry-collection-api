    "Your friend has died, with whom",
    "You roamed the streets,",
    "At all hours, talking philosophy.",
    "So, today you went alone,",
    "Stopping often to change places",
    "With your imaginary companion,",
    "And argue back against yourself",
    "On the subject of appearances:",
    "The world we see in our heads",
    "And the world we see daily,",
    "So difficult to tell apart",
    "When grief and sorrow bow us over.",
    "You two often got so carried away",
    "You found yourselves in strange neighborhoods",
    "Lost among unfriendly folk,",
    "Having to ask for directions",
    "While on the verge of a supreme insight,",
    "Repeating your question",
    "To an old woman or a child",
    "Both of whom may have been deaf and dumb.",
    "What was that fragment of Heraclitus",
    "You were trying to remember",
    "As you stepped on the butcher\u2019s cat?",
    "Meantime, you yourself were lost",
    "Between someone\u2019s new black shoe",
    "Left on the sidewalk",
    "And the sudden terror and exhilaration",
    "At the sight of a girl",
    "Dressed up for a night of dancing",
    "Speeding by on roller skates."
