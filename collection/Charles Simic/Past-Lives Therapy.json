    "They explained to me the bloody bandages",
    "On the floor in the maternity ward in Rochester, N.Y.,",
    "Cured the backache I acquired bowing to my old master,",
    "Made me stop putting thumbtacks round my bed.",
    "They showed me an officer on horseback,",
    "Waving a saber next to a burning farmhouse",
    "And a barefoot woman in a nightgown,",
    "Throwing stones after him and calling him Lucifer.",
    "I was a straw-headed boy in patched overalls.",
    "Come dark a chicken would roost in my hair.",
    "Some even laid eggs as I played my ukulele",
    "And my mother and father crossed themselves.",
    "Next, I saw myself inside an abandoned gas station",
    "Constructing a spaceship out of a coffin,",
    "Red traffic cone, cement mixer and ear warmers,",
    "When a church lady fainted seeing me in my underwear.",
    "Some days, however, they opened door after door,",
    "Always to a different room, and could not find me.",
    "There\u2019d be only a small squeak now and then,",
    "As if a miner\u2019s canary got caught in a mousetrap."
