    "Their long stares mark them apart; eyes gone",
    "to sea-colors: gray, foam-flecked",
    "and black in the undertow, blue",
    "as the blue banners of the mackerel, whipping west.",
    "On land, they are smoke-walkers, where each stone",
    "is a standing stone, every circle a stone circle.",
    "They would be rumor if they could, in this frozen",
    "landscape like a stopped sea, from the great stone keels",
    "of Callanish to the walls of Dunnottar and Drum.",
    "They would be less even than rumor:",
    "to be ocean-stealers, to never throw a shadow \u2014",
    "to dream the blank horizon and dread the sight of land.",
    "The drink storms through these men, uncompasses",
    "them, till they\u2019re all at sea again.",
    "Their houses, heeled over in the sand:",
    "each ruin now a cairn for kites.",
    "And down by the quay",
    "past empty pots, unmended nets, and boats:",
    "this tiny bar, where men sleep upright",
    "in their own element, as seals."
