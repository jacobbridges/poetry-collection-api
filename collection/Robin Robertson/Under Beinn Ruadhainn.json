    "Three moons in the sky",
    "the night they found him",
    "drowned in Sawtan\u2019s Bog;",
    "just his cap, sitting there",
    "and his wee fat hands poking out.",
    "It was no loss",
    "to the village, I told them",
    "next morning,",
    "and the villagers agreed.",
    "Horn-daft, he was,",
    "havering and glaikit",
    "and scaring the children.",
    "I mind that time",
    "he picked up a mouse",
    "and ate it, quick,",
    "in two mouthfuls;",
    "set the tail aside",
    "on the ground",
    "like a cocktail stick.",
    "I used her well, after that,",
    "his Jennie,",
    "still in her widow\u2019s weeds,",
    "gilping into her",
    "whenever I could,",
    "in the barn or the boathouse",
    "or off in the fields.",
    "She slipped two or three out at least,",
    "and sank each one in a lobster creel.",
    "Her head was away",
    "by the end, as mad as her man",
    "and no good to me.",
    "She sleeps now",
    "under Beinn Ruadhainn, her face",
    "covered in ivy,",
    "scab, and sticky-willow.",
    "The dreams came then.",
    "Last night, the burning loch,",
    "so full of bairns",
    "they bobbed to the surface",
    "with their hair on fire;",
    "black snow; fingers",
    "coming through the floorboards;",
    "rain like razor blades;",
    "the foosty-faced man,",
    "there at every corner,",
    "hands furred with grey-mould.",
    "And her, as always,",
    "star-naked, hatching",
    "in the herring-nets.",
    "The last I remember",
    "was my body being driven",
    "with sticks through the town",
    "to Sawtan\u2019s Brae, and hanged.",
    "I broke from sleep and sat up sweating,",
    "dream-fleyed in the dark.",
    "I groped around for the matches",
    "and the matches were put in my hand."
