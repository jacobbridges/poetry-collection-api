    "A figment, a thumbed",

    "ditched plaything, something",

    "coming apart at the seams.",

    "of perished rubber, one ear",
    "eaten away, his sour body",
    "lumped like a bean-bag",
    "leaking thinly",
    "into a grim towel. I sit",
    "and watch the light",
    "degrade in his eyes.",
    "He tries and fails",
    "to climb to his chair, shirks",
    "in one corner of the kitchen,",
    "cowed, denatured, ceasing to be",
    "anything like a cat,",
    "and there's a new look",
    "in those eyes",
    "that refuse to meet mine",
    "and it's the shame of being",
    "found out. Just that.",
    "And with that",
    "loss of face",
    "his face, I see,",
    "has turned human."
