    "Blessings on thee, little man,",
    "Barefoot boy, with cheek of tan!",
    "With thy turned-up pantaloons,",
    "And thy merry whistled tunes;",
    "With thy red lip, redder still",
    "Kissed by strawberries on the hill;",
    "With the sunshine on thy face,",
    "Through thy torn brim\u2019s jaunty grace;",
    "From my heart I give thee joy,\u2014",
    "I was once a barefoot boy!",
    "Prince thou art,\u2014the grown-up man",
    "Only is republican.",
    "Let the million-dollared ride!",
    "Barefoot, trudging at his side,",
    "Thou hast more than he can buy",
    "In the reach of ear and eye,\u2014",
    "Outward sunshine, inward joy:",
    "Blessings on thee, barefoot boy!",
    "Oh for boyhood\u2019s painless play,",
    "Sleep that wakes in laughing day,",
    "Health that mocks the doctor\u2019s rules,",
    "Knowledge never learned of schools,",
    "Of the wild bee\u2019s morning chase,",
    "Of the wild-flower\u2019s time and place,",
    "Flight of fowl and habitude",
    "Of the tenants of the wood;",
    "How the tortoise bears his shell,",
    "How the woodchuck digs his cell,",
    "And the ground-mole sinks his well;",
    "How the robin feeds her young,",
    "How the oriole\u2019s nest is hung;",
    "Where the whitest lilies blow,",
    "Where the freshest berries grow,",
    "Where the ground-nut trails its vine,",
    "Where the wood-grape\u2019s clusters shine;",
    "Of the black wasp\u2019s cunning way,",
    "Mason of his walls of clay,",
    "And the architectural plans",
    "Of gray hornet artisans!",
    "For, eschewing books and tasks,",
    "Nature answers all he asks;",
    "Hand in hand with her he walks,",
    "Face to face with her he talks,",
    "Part and parcel of her joy,\u2014",
    "Blessings on the barefoot boy!",
    "Oh for boyhood\u2019s time of June,",
    "Crowding years in one brief moon,",
    "When all things I heard or saw,",
    "Me, their master, waited for.",
    "I was rich in flowers and trees,",
    "Humming-birds and honey-bees;",
    "For my sport the squirrel played,",
    "Plied the snouted mole his spade;",
    "For my taste the blackberry cone",
    "Purpled over hedge and stone;",
    "Laughed the brook for my delight",
    "Through the day and through the night,",
    "Whispering at the garden wall,",
    "Talked with me from fall to fall;",
    "Mine the sand-rimmed pickerel pond,",
    "Mine the walnut slopes beyond,",
    "Mine, on bending orchard trees,",
    "Apples of Hesperides!",
    "Still as my horizon grew,",
    "Larger grew my riches too;",
    "All the world I saw or knew",
    "Seemed a complex Chinese toy,",
    "Fashioned for a barefoot boy!",
    "Oh for festal dainties spread,",
    "Like my bowl of milk and bread;",
    "Pewter spoon and bowl of wood,",
    "On the door-stone, gray and rude!",
    "O\u2019er me, like a regal tent,",
    "Cloudy-ribbed, the sunset bent,",
    "Purple-curtained, fringed with gold,",
    "Looped in many a wind-swung fold;",
    "While for music came the play",
    "Of the pied frogs\u2019 orchestra;",
    "And, to light the noisy choir,",
    "Lit the fly his lamp of fire.",
    "I was monarch: pomp and joy",
    "Waited on the barefoot boy!",
    "Cheerily, then, my little man,",
    "Live and laugh, as boyhood can!",
    "Though the flinty slopes be hard,",
    "Stubble-speared the new-mown sward,",
    "Every morn shall lead thee through",
    "Fresh baptisms of the dew;",
    "Every evening from thy feet",
    "Shall the cool wind kiss the heat:",
    "All too soon these feet must hide",
    "In the prison cells of pride,",
    "Lose the freedom of the sod,",
    "Like a colt\u2019s for work be shod,",
    "Made to tread the mills of toil,",
    "Up and down in ceaseless moil:",
    "Happy if their track be found",
    "Never on forbidden ground;",
    "Happy if they sink not in",
    "Quick and treacherous sands of sin.",
    "Ah! that thou couldst know thy joy,",
    "Ere it passes, barefoot boy!"
