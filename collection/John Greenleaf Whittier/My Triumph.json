    "The autumn-time has come;",
    "On woods that dream of bloom,",
    "And over purpling vines,",
    "The low sun fainter shines.",
    "The aster-flower is failing,",
    "The hazel\u2019s gold is paling;",
    "Yet overhead more near",
    "The eternal stars appear!",
    "And present gratitude",
    "Insures the future\u2019s good,",
    "And for the things I see",
    "I trust the things to be;",
    "That in the paths untrod,",
    "And the long days of God,",
    "My feet shall still be led,",
    "My heart be comforted.",
    "O living friends who love me!",
    "O dear ones gone above me!",
    "Careless of other fame,",
    "I leave to you my name.",
    "Hide it from idle praises,",
    "Save it from evil phrases:",
    "Why, when dear lips that spake it",
    "Are dumb, should strangers wake it?",
    "Let the thick curtain fall;",
    "I better know than all",
    "How little I have gained,",
    "How vast the unattained.",
    "Not by the page word-painted",
    "Let life be banned or sainted:",
    "Deeper than written scroll",
    "The colors of the soul.",
    "Sweeter than any sung",
    "My songs that found no tongue;",
    "Nobler than any fact",
    "My wish that failed of act.",
    "Others shall sing the song,",
    "Others shall right the wrong,\u2014",
    "Finish what I begin,",
    "And all I fail of win.",
    "What matter, I or they?",
    "Mine or another\u2019s day,",
    "So the right word be said",
    "And life the sweeter made?",
    "Hail to the coming singers!",
    "Hail to the brave light-bringers!",
    "Forward I reach and share",
    "All that they sing and dare.",
    "The airs of heaven blow o\u2019er me;",
    "A glory shines before me",
    "Of what mankind shall be,\u2014",
    "Pure, generous, brave, and free.",
    "A dream of man and woman",
    "Diviner but still human,",
    "Solving the riddle old,",
    "Shaping the Age of Gold!",
    "The love of God and neighbor;",
    "An equal-handed labor;",
    "The richer life, where beauty",
    "Walks hand in hand with duty.",
    "Ring, bells in unreared steeples,",
    "The joy of unborn peoples!",
    "Sound, trumpets far off blown,",
    "Your triumph is my own!",
    "Parcel and part of all,",
    "I keep the festival,",
    "Fore-reach the good to be,",
    "And share the victory.",
    "I feel the earth move sunward,",
    "I join the great march onward,",
    "And take, by faith, while living,",
    "My freehold of thanksgiving."
