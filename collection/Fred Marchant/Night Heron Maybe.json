    "I woke to more rain, and felt in the dark",
    "for how wet the sill was, then rolled back",
    "to my radio, and a midnight preacher",
    "in my earphone teaching about sin.",
    "I learned that punishment would come",
    "like lightning that surprises an innocent shore.",
    "Thunder would follow me all my days,",
    "stern reminder and sharp rebuke.",
    "The long, sleek, and pointed call",
    "that rose, as if in response, out of the estuary",
    "of night and storm, said it knew well",
    "what the given world gave, and wanted more."
