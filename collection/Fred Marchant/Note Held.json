    "linoleum flecked with flame,",

    "a stripe painted on the wall. Someone",
    "would walk with me as well. I felt fine",
    "I said, and it was sort of true. Actually",
    "I felt nailed by one wrist to a desire",
    "to flee and by the other to a sincere",
    "longing for sleep. I was not in pain.",
    "Thank you. I felt like the very last note",
    "in a concert, the one that hovers as if",
    "it wants to linger, but is already over.\u201d"
