    "What god was it that would open",
    "earth\u2019s picture book and see the two",
    "of us on a road, snowfields glittering",
    "on every side and poplars bent like",
    "the fingers of an old man clutching",
    "what he loved about the sun?",
    "Which one was it that would peer",
    "into our thatched, white-washed",
    "farmhouse, and see the fur, flies,",
    "and shit-stained walls? Which one",
    "laughed at the barbed wire fences,",
    "the wall topped with broken glass?",
    "Which of the many who came then,",
    "gleaming and rimed in hard sunlight?",
    "Which of those who bobbed like ice",
    "along the winter shore? What did",
    "we have that any god would want?",
    "Quick, if you can find it, hide it."
