    "we make midnight a maquette of the year:",
    "frostlight glinting off snow to solemnize",
    "the vows we offer to ourselves in near",
    "silence: the competition shimmerwise",
    "of champagne and chandeliers to attract",
    "laughter and cheers: the glow from the fireplace",
    "reflecting the burning intra-red pact",
    "between beloveds: we cosset the space",
    "of a fey hour, anxious gods molding our",
    "hoped-for adams with this temporal clay:",
    "each of us edacious for shining or",
    "rash enough to think sacrifice will stay",
    "this fugacious time: while stillness suspends",
    "vitality in balance, as passions",
    "struggle with passions for sway, the mind wends",
    "towards what\u2019s to come: a callithump of fashions,",
    "ersatz smiles, crowded days: a bloodless cut",
    "that severs soul from bone: a long aching",
    "quiet in which we will hear nothing but",
    "the clean crack of our promises breaking."
