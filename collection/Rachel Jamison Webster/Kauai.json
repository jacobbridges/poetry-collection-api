    "We\u2019ve come back to the site of her",
    "conception. She calls it",
    "and cries all night,",
    "sleepless, wild.",
    "It seems the way is always",
    "floating and the goal \u2014",
    "to live so the ghosts we were",
    "don\u2019t trail us and echo.",
    "I think we are inside a flower,",
    "under a pollen of stars vast as scattered sand.",
    "The air pulses with perfume,",
    "flowers calling to flowers and the ferrying air.",
    "But my eyes are thin and elsewhere.",
    "I am thinking, maybe",
    "even coming into the soul",
    "is a difficult birth, squeezed by the body\u2019s vise.",
    "My bent legs like pincers",
    "or the vegetable petals of some tropical flower.",
    "Even my mind gripped by the folds",
    "of the flesh, how the cells keep twinning",
    "themselves out toward complexity.",
    "The tulip trees of the valley",
    "spread their bone canopies into slick green leaves",
    "and fire flowers deep as cups.",
    "Their cups fill with rain, rain",
    "drinks the leaves drinking rain.",
    "I can\u2019t begin to explain.",
    "How on this porous peak of stone in the sea",
    "our daughter came into me.",
    "Little flick of a fish I could not see.",
    "I was just learning to be human",
    "and upright among all that life.",
    "And what was real was stranger",
    "than night with its dust of unnamed suns.",
    "It was the beyond in us. And she was."
