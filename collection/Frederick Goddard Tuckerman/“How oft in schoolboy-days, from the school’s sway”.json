    "How oft in schoolboy-days, from the school\u2019s sway",
    "Have I run forth to Nature as to a friend,\u2014",
    "With some pretext of o\u2019erwrought sight, to spend",
    "My school-time in green meadows far away!",
    "Careless of summoning bell, or clocks that strike,",
    "I marked with flowers the minutes of my day:",
    "For still the eye that shrank from hated hours,",
    "Dazzled with decimal and dividend,",
    "Knew each bleached alder-root that plashed across",
    "The bubbling brook, and every mass of moss;",
    "Could tell the month, too, by the vervain-spike,\u2014",
    "How far the ring of purple tiny flowers",
    "Had climbed; just starting, may-be, with the May,",
    "Half-light, or tapering off at Summer\u2019s end."
