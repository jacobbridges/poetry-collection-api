    "Some species can crack pavement with their shoots",
    "to get their share of sun some species lay",
    "a purple froth of eggs and leave it there",
    "to sprinkle tidepools with tadpole confetti",
    "some species though you stomp them in the carpet",
    "have already stashed away the families",
    "that will inherit every floor at midnight",
    "But others don\u2019t go forth and multiply",
    "as boldly male and female peeling the bamboo",
    "their keepers watching in despair or those",
    "endangered species numbered individually",
    "and mapped from perch to oblivious perch",
    "For weeks the world it seemed was plagued",
    "with babies forests dwindling into cradles",
    "rows of women hissing for an obstetrician",
    "babies no one could feed babies received",
    "by accident like misdirected mail",
    "from God so many babies people hired",
    "women to hold them babies babies everywhere",
    "but not a one to name When we got home",
    "the local news showed us a mother with",
    "quintuplets she was suckling them in shifts",
    "a mountain of sheets universally admired",
    "a goddess of fertility her smile",
    "could persuade the skies to rain Her litter",
    "slept ointment-eyed in pink wool caps while Dad",
    "ran his hand through his hair thinking maybe",
    "of money as he stood surveying his",
    "crowded living room his wealth of heartbeats",
    "Pizza and pop that night and there unasked inside",
    "the bottlecap was",
    "you set it down and did not speak of it",
    "the moon flanked by her brood of stars that night",
    "a chaste distracted kiss goodnight that night",
    "your body quiet having spilled its secret",
    "your palms flat on your belly holding holding",
    "Forgive me if I had no words that night",
    "but I was wondering in the silence still",
    "begetting silence whether to console you",
    "if I consoled you it would make the loss",
    "your loss and so we laid beside ourselves",
    "a while because I had no words until",
    "our bodies folded shut our bodies closed",
    "around hope like a book preserving petals",
    "a book we did not open till the morning when",
    "we found hope dry and brittle but intact"
