    "Into the rood wood, where the grain's current splits",
    "around the stones of its knots, carve eyelashes and eyelids.",
    "Dye the knots, too\u2014indigo, ink-black, vermillion",
    "irises. These will be his eyes, always open, willing",
    "themselves not to close when dust rises or sweat falls,",
    "eyes witnessing, dimly, the eclipse that shawls",
    "the shuddering hill, Jerusalem's naked shoulder.",
    "The body itself? From a wick that still whiffs of smolder,",
    "wax, because wax sloughs a smooth skein on the fingers just",
    "below sensation's threshold. Prop the cross",
    "upright and let the tear-hot wax trickle, slow, clot, taper",
    "into a torso, thighs, calves, feet. Of Gideon Bible paper,",
    "thinner than skin, cut him his scrap of cloth; embed",
    "iron shavings in his forehead,",
    "and, as the wax cools, scrape the rust off an old fuel can",
    "to salt the whole wound that is the man.",
    "Cry, if you feel like crying, and if no one else is there.",
    "Then set it on the counter with your other wares."
