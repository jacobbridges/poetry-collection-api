    "Imagine for a moment",
    "the still life of our meals,",
    "meat followed by yellow cheese,",
    "grapes pale against the blue armor of fish.",
    "Imagine a thin woman",
    "before bread was invented,",
    "playing a harp of wheat in the field.",
    "There is a stone, and behind her",
    "the bones of the last killed,",
    "the black bird on her shoulder",
    "that a century later",
    "will fly with trained and murderous intent.",
    "They are not very hungry",
    "because cuisine has not yet been invented.",
    "Nor has falconry,",
    "nor the science of imagination.",
    "All they have is the pure impulse to eat,",
    "which is not enough to keep them alive",
    "and this little moment",
    "before the woman redeems",
    "the sprouted seeds at her feet",
    "and gathers the olives falling from the trees",
    "for her recipes.",
    "Imagine. Out in the fields",
    "this very moment",
    "they are rolling the apples to press,",
    "the lamb turns in a regular aura of smoke.",
    "See, the woman looks once behind her",
    "before picking up the stone,",
    "looks back once at the beasts,",
    "the trees,",
    "that sky",
    "above the white stream",
    "where small creatures live and die",
    "looking upon each other",
    "as food."
