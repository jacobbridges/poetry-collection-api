    "I try to make myself afraid,",
    "the way you must have been afraid,",
    "stepping out onto this stage\u2014",
    "but with a fear so pure, so",
    "perfectly informed that you strode",
    "out shouting. Here, where",
    "the neon yellow arrows painted",
    "on the floor shoot forward underfoot",
    "in blackness\u2014beneath the hanging",
    "sequence of tinted skies\u2014out toward",
    "that mindless immortalizing light, now",
    "dark. Now I think I feel the heat you",
    "must have felt rising from the front rows.",
    "A gaping fire door, a furnace:",
    "your single body standing here",
    "with no shadow, swinging on itself.",
    "Had you been a fool, you might have thought",
    "that they loved you. They never love you,",
    "you said. They are hungry for the god",
    "in his gold eclipse, the pure you on fire.",
    "John and I move quickly, each with a handful",
    "of ash, scattering. The sound of no sound falling",
    "into the cracks in the boards, the footlights,",
    "the first row. A small personal snow: a prince",
    "of dust, a villain of dust. Each part you played",
    "drifting up again, recomposing. I open my hand,",
    "I let you go\u2014back into the lines you learned,",
    "back into the body and the body's beauty\u2014",
    "back into the standing ovation: bow after bow after bow."
