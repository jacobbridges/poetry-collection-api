    "the high sobbing cry of the muezzin",
    "hanging in the sky before it\u2019s light",
    "but then, I drop off to sleep again.",
    "Behind us is the ex-embassy.",
    "Its pool a blue mosaic through",
    "our hedge. The old man",
    "in robe and wrapped head no longer",
    "comes to mop the tiled edge\u2014",
    "his whole morning\u2019s work",
    "fragmented by our wall of leaves.",
    "No arm in a rolled sleeve,",
    "bending, lifting. No flashing sections",
    "of aluminum pole fit into a blue mesh scoop",
    "for whisking up floating petals.",
    "No closeup: like a Cubist inset,",
    "a turbanned man sipping tea,",
    "eyebrow and striped cup,",
    "slice of a woman\u2019s profile",
    "black half-veil, two eyes",
    "yoked in kohl moving in a hand-held",
    "mirror. No sun machine-gunning",
    "that round of glass. No part",
    "of a lamb turning on part of a spit.",
    "No peacock opening a bit",
    "of its promiscuous fan.",
    "No cook hurrying the meat",
    "with jagged curses. No meat.",
    "No god. No medallion front,",
    "officially defaced,",
    "the cornices deflagged",
    "as bare crude evidence",
    "or our power to invade,",
    "theirs to resist.",
    "A For Sale sign likens it",
    "to a house on a cloud,",
    "a sunrise mosque. It has",
    "patterned tiles with sickles",
    "of wheat or hashish. And wickets,",
    "a",
    "engemmed",
    "with rotating spots.",
    "Maybe a neighbor, through",
    "a closing door,",
    "saw grown men cry out",

    "to a god no one comprehends.",
    "No one comprehends how,",

    "Not anything you could imagine",
    "not any servant",
    "but the familiar reductive infinite\u2014",
    "lines of fuel drums, phone wires.",
    "Rolled up in the bottom of a child\u2019s red valise,",
    "timing devices, threads of plastique . . .",
    "left behind for the doubters,",
    "the personal grit of some other deity,",
    "some intoxicating tattooed Allah",
    "above the human ruins, head in hand.",
    "Not that. Not this. In the garden,",
    "a broken rope of amber beads,",
    "within each separate bead",
    "the lights of patrols go by,",
    "elongate\u2014the next night and the next\u2014",
    "but learn to dread",
    "turns over slowly in my bed."
