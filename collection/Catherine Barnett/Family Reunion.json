    "My father scolded us all for refusing his liquor.",
    "He kept buying tequila, and steak for the grill,",
    "until finally we joined him, making margaritas,",
    "cutting the fat off the bone.",
    "When he saw how we drank, my sister",
    "shredding the black labels into her glass",
    "while his remaining grandchildren",
    "dragged their thin bunk bed mattresses",
    "first out to the lawn to play",
    "then farther up the field to sleep next to her,",
    "I think it was then he changed,",
    "something in him died. He's gentler now,",
    "quiet, losing weight though every night",
    "he eats the same ice cream he always ate",
    "only now he's not drinking,",
    "he doesn't fall asleep with the spoon in his hand,",
    "he waits for my mother to come lie down with him."
