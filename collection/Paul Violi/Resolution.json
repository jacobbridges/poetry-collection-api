    "Whereas the porch screen sags from",
    "the weight of flowers (impatiens) that grew",
    "against it, then piles of wet leaves,",
    "then drifted snow; and",
    "Whereas, now rolled like absence in its",
    "drooping length, a dim gold wave,",
    "sundown\u2019s last, cast across a sea of clouds",
    "and the floating year, almost reaches",
    "the legs of the low-slung chair; and",
    "Whereas between bent trees flies",
    "and bees twirl above apples",
    "and peaches fallen on blue gravel; and",
    "Whereas yesterday\u2019s thunder shook blossoms",
    "off laurel the day after they appeared; and",
    "Whereas in the dust, the fine and perfect",
    "dust of cat-paw prints scattered across",
    "the gleaming car hood, something",
    "softer than blossoms falls away,",
    "something your lips left on mine; and",
    "Whereas it\u2019s anyone\u2019s guess as to how long",
    "it\u2019s been since a humid day sank so low,",
    "so far from the present that missing",
    "sensations or the sensation of something",
    "missing have left impressions in the air,",
    "the kind a head leaves on a pillow; and",
    "Whereas the last of ancient, unconvincing",
    "notions evaporate from the damp pages",
    "of thick, old books that describe how,",
    "for instance, Time and Love once",
    "lay together here; how in a slurred flash",
    "of light she turned and waded back",
    "into the sea, and how the slack",
    "part of any day was and is",
    "all in the way he, half",
    "asleep, felt her hand slip out of his; and",
    "Whereas, the blue heron stands on the shore;",
    "while the sleek heron turns, broad",
    "to narrow, half hidden among the reeds;",
    "turning with the stealth, the sweep",
    "of twilight\u2019s narrowing minute,",
    "of stillness taking aim; turning",
    "until it almost disappears into",
    "the arrowhead instant the day disappears,",
    "until, staring out of the reeds,",
    "the aforementioned heron",
    "is more felt than seen; and",
    "Whereas, you, with due forethought",
    "and deliberation, bite into",
    "an apple\u2019s heart and wish it were your own"
