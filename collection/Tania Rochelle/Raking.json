    "Anna Bell and Lane, eighty,",
    "make small leaf piles in the heat,",
    "each pile a great joint effort,",
    "like fifty years of marriage,",
    "sharing chores a rusty dance.",
    "In my own yard, the stacks",
    "are big as children, who scatter them,",
    "dodge and limbo the poke",
    "of my rake. We\u2019re lucky,",
    "young and straight-boned.",
    "And I feel sorry for the couple,",
    "bent like parentheses",
    "around their brittle little lawn.",
    "I like feeling sorry for them,",
    "the tenderness of it, but only",
    "for a moment: John glides in",
    "like a paper airplane, takes",
    "the children for the weekend,",
    "and I remember,",
    "they\u2019re the lucky ones\u2014",
    "shriveled Anna Bell, loving",
    "her crooked Lane."
