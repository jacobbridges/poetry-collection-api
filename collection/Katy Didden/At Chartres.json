    "Who wielded the chisel",
    "at the left portal,",
    "south porch, the scene",
    "of Theo chained,",
    "naked to the waist, leaning in",
    "to the brutal hand",
    "of what looks to be",
    "an even younger boy?",
    "What man carved stone",
    "to mimic flesh",
    "as it would look inside",
    "the torture of its flensing?",
    "How he must have held",
    "the scene in his own",
    "mind, thought it back",
    "to the act itself,",
    "modeling the lines",
    "with his own limbs",
    "so he would know",
    "both how a body",
    "bends in pain, and how",
    "a hand extends the flayer\u2019s rake."
