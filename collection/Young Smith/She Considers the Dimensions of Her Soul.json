    "The shape of her soul is a square.",
    "She knows this to be the case",
    "because she often feels its corners",
    "pressing sharp against the bone",
    "just under her shoulder blades",
    "and across the wings of her hips.",
    "At one time, when she was younger,",
    "she had hoped that it might be a cube,",
    "but the years have worked to dispel",
    "this illusion of space, so that now",
    "she understands: it is a simple plane,",
    "a shape with surface, but no volume\u2014",
    "a window without a building, an eye",
    "without a mind.",
    "Of course, this square",
    "does not appear on x-rays, and often,",
    "weeks may pass when she forgets",
    "that it exists. When she does think",
    "to consider its purpose in her life,",
    "she can say only that it aches with",
    "a single mystery, for whose answer",
    "she has long ago given up the search\u2014",
    "since its question is a word whose name",
    "can never quite be asked. This yearning,",
    "she has concluded, is the only function",
    "of the square, repeated again and again",
    "in each of its four matching angles,",
    "until, with time, she is persuaded",
    "anew that what it frames has no",
    "interest in ever making her happy."
