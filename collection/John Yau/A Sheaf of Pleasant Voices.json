    "There are rooftops",
    "made of cloud remnants",
    "gathered by a trader",
    "dabbling in car parts and burlap",
    "At night, I dive onto the breeze",
    "fermenting above the dirt",
    "and dream that I am a crocodile",
    "a tin of shoe polish, an audience of two",
    "In the morning, before the smallest yawn",
    "becomes a noodle, I am offered",
    "a ribbon of yellow smoke",
    "I opt for fuzzy rocks and clawed water",
    "and, of course, the perishable window",
    "I am one of the last computer",
    "chain errors to be illuminated",
    "I tell you there are rooftops",
    "on which the moon stops",
    "being a cold jewel",
    "And one by one the mountains",
    "begin their descent from",
    "the chambers of a lost book"
