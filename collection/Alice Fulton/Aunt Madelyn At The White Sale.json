    "Here is the kingdom of irregulars,",
    "land of no-two-alike,",
    "I hunt furiously",
    "useful towels. Closets simmering with",
    "terry, linen, beach or tea",
    "can never be full",
    "enough to stop these sprees.",
    "Hoarding is relative",
    "to love or fear, but not to need. Mother stockpiled",
    "soap in step-on cans.",
    "When the lid snapped back,",
    "instead of grinds, grease, skins, it was good",
    "to get a whiff",
    "of the bars, neat and brightly wrapped as gifts.",
    "Waving us off on dates, she'd yell \"Be back by twelve",
    "and don't come home",
    "if you get killed.\" But I wasn't killed,",
    "easy as that seemed. I hadn't figured on",
    "life's pigheadedness:",
    "how the breath and pulse are triggered by a hardwon",
    "inability to unexist. How death is",
    "tightfisted. I thought",
    "at first there'd been a car crash: my voice soared, brilliant",
    "and bubbling with drugs: oh, that that too too",
    "euphoric",
    "stutter should be mine!",
    "Then, with a coziness worse than constraint, they",
    "spoke of the cerebral pinch I'd been in, praised",
    "the luck that chucked me",
    "back to sanitized light. Where towels absorb their weight",
    "in chaos. Where I am serene.",
    "Like those damn orchids\u2014",
    "vivid, blizzardy sprays Tom and I trucked",
    "out West that time, and, one by one, heat or dark",
    "got them: my brainwaves.",
    "The last was that dendrobium...or is",
    "that my medication? See? Last week I went",
    "and rang the wrong bell",
    "after twenty-odd years of visiting",
    "my beaming, well-meaning sister.",
    "I worry now",
    "about another sister who manages neither",
    "smiles nor meaning. Those years I coaxed her through",
    "treatments, hoping\u2014",
    "if not for her thanks or love, then what?",
    "Nothing...but the nothing I've received",
    "has me shuddering.",
    "Rage makes my blood astringent as witch hazel.",
    "I'll pretend not to see them pretend not to",
    "see my infirmities:",
    "My restless hands. Idling. Pilling the spread.",
    "Of course, you can get killed at home and that's something",
    "Mother never mentioned. My mind drifts",
    "to my friend Miriam, that deadly fire\u2014I see again",
    "her pleasant, stocky face. \"Mada, we're sharp",
    "as ever,\" she said last time,",
    "but she was fooled. With luck she slept right through.",
    "Outside snowflakes lift, float sideways, and seem",
    "to say \"ground has nothing",
    "to do with me!\" But this is silly.",
    "Though I can't trace one among the calm bustle",
    "of shoppers, I tell myself",
    "they",
    "falling, they",
    "touch earth, and they",
    "never rise at all."
