    "Everyone's spending Christmas Eve adrift",
    "in the corporal skirmish, mixing",
    "up the darks with the lights, fending",
    "with elbows and dirty",
    "looks. Wet wool and down",
    "crowd the air. Where are the stars, pristine",
    "as great ideas? Behind clouds",
    "the heavens saturate",
    "with luminous dust, shuttles wearing halos",
    "of earthdirt, light pollution",
    "from jets fired to keep things",
    "on course. Boys rickrack a ball off",
    "floor and ceiling past the table",
    "tree bubbling with giveaway",
    "ornaments from Burger King and lights",
    "that manage an occasional",
    "lackadaisical flash. Showstoppers: everyone",
    "looks every time and keeps looking",
    "to make sure it happened.",
    "The double frontloaders are going",
    "like abstract TVs. And the program is important:",
    "all about the boggling sullied",
    "lives we'd like to hide.",
    "But this is no place",
    "to do so, where known",
    "and unknown perverts come",
    "to pirate underpants and the innocent",
    "clutch their Cheer and Shout.",
    "The rules are posted: only the toughest",
    "habiliments, the superego",
    "of raiment can take such agitation.",
    "And only the poor are invited to endure",
    "the sneezy powders and clean resentment.",
    "Imagine a museum installation\u2014",
    "200 hypnotic washers stuffed with somersaulting",
    "cloth. Critics could rise to the challenge,",
    "their statements settling like coats",
    "of gold and silver",
    "chain mail over each machine:",
    "\"These Speed Queen pieces thrust ahead of art-",
    "for-art's sake to confront us",
    "with a realism of socio-political",
    "magnitude. The vortex-like movement",
    "of pattern, color, and texture infuses",
    "these works with an abundance of unconscious",
    "bliss. The soft forms",
    "circulate with vigor",
    "across the screens. The viewer",
    "is not privy",
    "to the cause of dirt",
    "though one is witness to the dirt's",
    "ablutions. The point is",
    "we are not impeccable.\"",
    "Everyone would be happy",
    "to know that! And so we're forced to",
    "scoop and pour",
    "a fine white empathy over",
    "the hairy flannels, snaggy nylons,",
    "the glass front that gives",
    "forth this light",
    "industry, the silly tree",
    "and jingles about blue and white",
    "Christmases, chestnuts, sleighbells,",
    "just as snow settles",
    "on every unsequestered thing:",
    "from blistered gum -",
    "ball machines, clumsy bumpers,",
    "crepuscular theaters with sticky floors,",
    "to ramshackle mansions",
    "choked with smiling",
    "china animals where light shakes itself out",
    "from TVs and old women",
    "frail as walking sticks",
    "sweep their stoops at eight a.m.",
    "Just as snow makes the less than impeccable",
    "classical, stroking the merely",
    "drab or passing, quickly or slowly,",
    "so we can count only on its",
    "leaving, teaching",
    "liquidity",
    "to what seems solid."
