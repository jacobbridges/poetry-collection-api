    "You sway like a crane to the tunes of tossed stones.",
    "I am what you made to live in",
    "from what you had: hair matted as kelp, bad schools.",
    "Oh, you will never know me. I wave and you go",
    "on playing in the clouds",
    "boys clap from erasers. I am the pebble",
    "you tossed on the chalked space and war-",
    "danced toward, one-leg two-leg, arms treading air.",
    "In this, your future, waves rechristen the sea",
    "after its tiny jeweled lives",
    "that hiss \u201cUs Us\u201d to the shore all day.",
    "Where\u2019s the kid called Kateydid? the moonfaced",
    "Kewpiedoll? The excitable pouting",
    "Zookie? The somber O-Be-Joyful?",
    "Lost girl, playing hopscotch, I will do what you could.",
    "Name of father, son, ghost. Cross my heart and hope.",
    "While the sea\u2019s jewels build shells and shells",
    "change to chalk and chalk to loam and gold",
    "wheat grows where oceans teetered."
