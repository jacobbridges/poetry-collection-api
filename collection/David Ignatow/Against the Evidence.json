    "As I reach to close each book",
    "lying open on my desk, it leaps up",
    "to snap at my fingers. My legs",
    "won\u2019t hold me, I must sit down.",
    "My fingers pain me",
    "where the thick leaves snapped together",
    "at my touch.",
    "All my life",
    "I\u2019ve held books in my hands",
    "like children, carefully turning",
    "their pages and straightening out",
    "their creases. I use books",
    "almost apologetically. I believe",
    "I often think their thoughts for them.",
    "Reading, I never know where theirs leave off",
    "and mine begin. I am so much alone",
    "in the world, I can observe the stars",
    "or study the breeze, I can count the steps",
    "on a stair on the way up or down,",
    "and I can look at another human being",
    "and get a smile, knowing",
    "it is for the sake of politeness.",
    "Nothing must be said of estrangement",
    "among the human race and yet",
    "nothing is said at all",
    "because of that.",
    "But no book will help either.",
    "I stroke my desk,",
    "its wood so smooth, so patient and still.",
    "I set a typewriter on its surface",
    "and begin to type",
    "to tell myself my troubles.",
    "Against the evidence, I live by choice."
