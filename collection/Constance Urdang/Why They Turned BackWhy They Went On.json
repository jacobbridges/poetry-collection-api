    "Because a black bird flew across the road;",
    "Because the attendant at the pump turned surly;",
    "Because the uncertain weather",
    "Made Mother nervous,",
    "And, back home, the telephone kept ringing",
    "In an empty house;",
    "Because a white bird flew across the road.",
    "How far had they come?",
    "How far did they go?",
    "Seeing, along river after river,",
    "Between shores of brush and willow,",
    "Only the bend ahead and the bend behind",
    "Under a sky featureless and hard",
    "As a shallow bowl; through tautologies",
    "Of a landscape unendingly repeated",
    "Mile after mile; down Main Street",
    "After Main Street, replications",
    "Of the same petty civic scenery;",
    "Hearing the ghosts of trains",
    "Crossing between cornfields,",
    "Clattering over the points, moaning",
    "Above creosote and cinders,",
    "As if the imagination",
    "Could produce nothing more",
    "Than the same landscape, cornfields,",
    "Rivers, and Main Streets",
    "Pulling them, like a magnet, not",
    "But",
    ", not into the future,",
    "But away from the past;",
    "Until a white bird flew across the road",
    "With its mysterious message, that said to some,",
    "\u201cTurn back,\u201d and to the rest, \u201cGo on.\u201d"
