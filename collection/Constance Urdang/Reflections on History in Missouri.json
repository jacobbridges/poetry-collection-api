    "This old house lodges no ghosts!",
    "Those swaggering specters who found their way",
    "Across the Atlantic",
    "Were left behind",
    "With their old European grudges",
    "In the farmhouses of New England",
    "And Pennsylvania",
    "Like so much jettisoned baggage",
    "Too heavy",
    "To lug over the Piedmont.",
    "The flatlands are inhospitable",
    "To phantoms. Here",
    "Shadows are sharp and arbitrary",
    "Not mazy, obscure,",
    "Cowering in corners",
    "Behind scary old boots in a cupboard",
    "Or muffled in empty coats, deserted",
    "By long-dead cousins",
    "(Who appear now and then",
    "But only in photographs",
    "Already rusting at the edges)\u0097",
    "Setting out in the creaking wagon",
    "Tight-lipped, alert to move on,",
    "The old settlers had no room",
    "For illusions.",
    "Their dangers were real.",
    "Now in the spare square house",
    "Their great-grandchildren",
    "Tidy away the past",
    "Until the polished surfaces",
    "Reflect not apparitions, pinched,",
    "Parched, craving, unsatisfied,",
    "But only their own faces."
