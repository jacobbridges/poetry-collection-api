    "What do we need for love\u2014a midnight fire",
    "Flinging itself by fistfuls up the chimney",
    "In soft bright snatches? Do we need the snow,",
    "Gentle as silence, covering the scars",
    "Of weeks of hunger, years of shabby having?",
    "Summer or winter? A heaven of stars? A room?",
    "The smiling mouth, the sadness of desire",
    "Are everywhere the same. If lovers go",
    "Along an unknown road, they find no less",
    "What is familiar. Let them stay at home,",
    "And all will still be strange. This they know",
    "Who with each heartbeat fight the fear of change."
