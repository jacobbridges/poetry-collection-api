    "In case you sit across from the meteorologist tonight,",
    "and in case the dim light over the booth in the bar still shines",
    "almost planetary on your large, smooth, winter-softened",
    "forehead, in case all of the day\u2014its woods and play, its fire\u2014",
    "has stayed on your beard, and will stay through the slight",
    "drift of mouth, the slackening of even your heart's muscle\u2014",
    ". . . well. I am filled with snow. There's nothing to do now",
    "but wait."
