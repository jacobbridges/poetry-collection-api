    "Now like the Lady of Shalott,",
    "I dwell within an empty room,",
    "And through the day and through the night",
    "I sit before an ancient loom.",
    "And like the Lady of Shalott",
    "I look into a mirror wide,",
    "Where shadows come, and shadows go,",
    "And ply my shuttle as they glide.",
    "Not as she wove the yellow wool,",
    "Ulysses\u2019 wife, Penelope;",
    "By day a queen among her maids,",
    "But in the night a woman, she,",
    "Who, creeping from her lonely couch,",
    "Unraveled all the slender woof;",
    "Or, with a torch, she climbed the towers,",
    "To fire the fagots on the roof!",
    "But weaving with a steady hand",
    "The shadows, whether false or true,",
    "I put aside a doubt which asks",
    "\u2018Among these phantoms what are you?\u2019",
    "For not with altar, tomb, or urn,",
    "Or long-haired Greek with hollow shield,",
    "Or dark-prowed ship with banks of oars,",
    "Or banquet in the tented field;",
    "Or Norman knight in armor clad,",
    "Waiting a foe where four roads meet;",
    "Or hawk and hound in bosky dell,",
    "Where dame and page in secret greet;",
    "Or rose and lily, bud and flower,",
    "My web is broidered. Nothing bright",
    "Is woven here: the shadows grow",
    "Still darker in the mirror\u2019s light!",
    "And as my web grows darker too,",
    "Accursed seems this empty room;",
    "For still I must forever weave",
    "These phantoms by this ancient loom."
