    "Husband, today could you and I behold",
    "The sun that brought us to our bridal morn",
    "Rising so splendid in the winter sky",
    "(We though fair spring returned), when we were wed;",
    "Could the shades vanish from these fifteen years,",
    "Which stand like columns guarding the approach",
    "To that great temple of the double soul",
    "That is as one \u2013 would you turn back, my dear,",
    "And, for the sake of Love\u2019s mysterious dream,",
    "As old as Adam and as sweet as Eve,",
    "Take me, as I took you, and once more go",
    "Towards that goal which none of us have reached?",
    "Contesting battles which but prove a loss,",
    "The victor vanquished by the wounded one;",
    "Teaching each other sacrifice of self,",
    "True immolation to the marriage bond;",
    "Learning the joys of birth, the woe of death,",
    "Leaving in chaos all the hopes of life\u2014",
    "Heart-broken, yet with courage pressing on",
    "For fame and fortune, artists needing both?",
    "Or, would you rather \u2013 I will acquiesce\u2014",
    "Since we must choose what is, and are grown gray,",
    "Stay in life\u2019s desert, watch our setting sun,",
    "Calm as those statues in Egyptian sands,",
    "Hand clasping hand, with patience and with peace,",
    "Wait for a future which contains no past?"
