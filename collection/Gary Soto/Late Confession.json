    "Monsignor, I believed Jesus followed me",
    "With his eyes, and when I slept,",
    "An angel peeled an orange",
    "And waited for me to wake up.",
    "This was 1962. I was ten, small as the flame",
    "Of a struck match, my lungs fiery",
    "From hard, wintery play. When I returned home,",
    "Legs hurting, I placed my hands on the windowsill",
    "And looked out\u2014clouds dirty as towels",
    "And geese I have yet to see again",
    "Darkening the western sky.",
    "Monsignor, a machine",
    "Had painted on the eyes of my toy soldier,",
    "Little dots off-center,",
    "Almost on his cheeks. Such a cheap toy,",
    "I drowned him over and over in my bath,",
    "Drowned him until the painted-on eyes flaked off.",
    "Then a leg fell off\u2014surge of dirty water",
    "Sunk him to the bottom.",
    "I now at this age place hands on the windowsill,",
    "My eyes nearly on my cheeks,",
    "My belly with its rising tide.",
    "There is no angel with an orange at the edge",
    "Of my bed. There is no soldier",
    "Of God. Only a pane between the inside",
    "And the outside, between this living",
    "And this dying. Monsignor,",
    "Saintly man of this child's wonderment,",
    "When will I see the geese again?"
