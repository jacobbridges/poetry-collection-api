    "There is the one who turns",
    "A spoon over like a letter,",
    "Reading the teeth-marks",
    "Older than his own;",
    "The one who strikes a match,",
    "Its light flowering",
    "In his eyes,",
    "The smoke in his throat;",
    "The one who opens the mouth",
    "Of a dog to listen",
    "To the sea, white-tipped",
    "And blind, feel its way to shore.",
    "At night",
    "They walk in the streets,",
    "The dust skirting their legs",
    "Raw with lice",
    "And the wind funneled",
    "Through a doorway",
    "Where someone might pray",
    "For a loaf of good luck.",
    "*",
    "Somewhere the old follow",
    "Their canes down",
    "A street where the front",
    "Pages of a newspaper",
    "Scuttle faceless",
    "And the three-legged dog hops home.",
    "A door is locked twice",
    "And flies ladder a scale of fish.",
    "Somewhere a window yellows",
    "From a lantern. A child",
    "With fever, swabbed in oils",
    "And mint, his face",
    "Spotted like an egg,",
    "His cry no different",
    "Than the cry",
    "That shakes the trees lean.",
    "A candle is lit for the dead",
    "Two worlds ahead of us all."
