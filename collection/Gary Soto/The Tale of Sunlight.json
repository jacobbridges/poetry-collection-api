    "Listen, nephew.",
    "When I opened the cantina",
    "At noon",
    "A triangle of sunlight",
    "Was stretched out",
    "On the floor",
    "Like a rug",
    "Like a tired cat.",
    "It flared in",
    "From the window",
    "Through a small hole",
    "Shaped like a yawn.",
    "Strange I thought",
    "And placed my hand",
    "Before the opening,",
    "But the sunlight",
    "Did not vanish.",
    "I pulled back",
    "The shutters",
    "And the room glowed,",
    "But this pyramid",
    "Of whiteness",
    "Was simply brighter.",
    "The sunlight around it",
    "Appeared soiled",
    "Like the bed sheet",
    "Of a borracho.",
    "Amazed, I locked the door,",
    "Closed the windows.",
    "Workers, in from",
    "The fields, knocked",
    "To be let in,",
    "Children peeked",
    "Through the shutters,",
    "But I remained silent.",
    "I poured a beer,",
    "At a table",
    "Shuffled a pack",
    "Of old cards,",
    "And watched it",
    "Cross the floor,",
    "Hang on the wall",
    "Like a portrait",
    "Like a calendar",
    "Without numbers.",
    "When a fly settled",
    "In the sunlight",
    "And disappeared",
    "In a wreath of smoke,",
    "I tapped it with the broom,",
    "Spat on it.",
    "The broom vanished.",
    "The spit sizzled.",
    "It is the truth, little one.",
    "I stood eye to blank eye",
    "And by misfortune",
    "This finger",
    "This pink stump",
    "Entered the sunlight,",
    "Snapped off",
    "With a dry sneeze,",
    "And fell to the floor",
    "As a gift",
    "To the ants",
    "Who know me",
    "For what I gave."
