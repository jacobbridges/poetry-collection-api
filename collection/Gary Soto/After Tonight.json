    "Because there are avenues",
    "Of traffic lights, a phone book",
    "Of brothers and lawyers,",
    "Why should you think your purse",
    "Will not be tugged from your arm",
    "Or the screen door",
    "Will remain latched",
    "Against the man",
    "Who hugs and kisses",
    "His pillow",
    "In the corridor of loneliness?",
    "There is a window of light",
    "A sprinkler turning",
    "As the earth turns,",
    "And you do not think of the hills",
    "And of the splintered wrists it takes",
    "To give you",
    "The heat rising toward the ceiling.",
    "You expect your daughter",
    "To be at the door any moment",
    "And your husband to arrive",
    "With the night",
    "That is suddenly all around.",
    "You expect the stove to burst",
    "A collar of fire",
    "When you want it,",
    "The siamese cats",
    "To move against your legs, purring.",
    "But remember this:",
    "Because blood revolves from one lung to the next,",
    "Why think it will",
    "After tonight?"
