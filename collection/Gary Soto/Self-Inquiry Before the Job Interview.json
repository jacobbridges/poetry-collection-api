    "Did you sneeze?",
    "Yes, I rid myself of the imposter inside me.",
    "Did you iron your shirt?",
    "Yes, I used the steam of mother's hate.",
    "Did you wash your hands?",
    "Yes, I learned my hygiene from a raccoon.",
    "I prayed on my knees, and my knees answered with pain.",
    "I gargled. I polished my shoes until I saw who I was.",
    "I inflated my r\u00e9sum\u00e9 by employing my middle name.",
    "I walked to my interview, early,",
    "The sun like a ring on an electric stove.",
    "I patted my hair when I entered the wind of a revolving door.",
    "The guard said, For a guy like you, it's the 19th floor.",
    "The economy was up. Flags whipped in every city plaza",
    "In America. This I saw for myself as I rode the elevator,",
    "Empty because everyone had a job but me.",
    "Did you clean your ears?",
    "Yes, I heard my fate in the drinking fountain's idiotic drivel.",
    "Did you slice a banana into your daily mush?",
    "I added a pinch of salt, two raisins to sweeten my breath.",
    "Did you remember your pen?",
    "I remembered my fingers when the elevator opened.",
    "I shook hands that dripped like a dirty sea.",
    "I found a chair and desk. My name tag said my name.",
    "Through the glass ceiling, I saw the heavy rumps of CEOs.",
    "Outside my window, the sun was a burning stove,",
    "All of us pushing papers",
    "To keep it going."
