    "\"I grant you ample leave",

    "But fill the void with definition, 'I'",
    "Will be no more a datum than the words",
    "You link false inference with, the 'Since' & 'so'",
    "That, true or not, make up the atom-whirl.",
    "Resolve your 'Ego', it is all one web",
    "With vibrant ether clotted into worlds:",
    "Your subject, self, or self-assertive 'I'",
    "Turns nought but object, melts to molecules,",
    "Is stripped from naked Being with the rest",
    "Of those rag-garments named the Universe.",
    "Or if, in strife to keep your 'Ego' strong",
    "You make it weaver of the etherial light,",
    "Space, motion, solids & the dream of Time \u2014",
    "Why, still 'tis Being looking from the dark,",
    "The core, the centre of your consciousness,",
    "That notes your bubble-world: sense, pleasure, pain,",
    "What are they but a shifting otherness,",
    "Phantasmal flux of moments? \u2014\""
