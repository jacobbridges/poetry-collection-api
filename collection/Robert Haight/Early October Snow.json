    "It will not stay.",
    "But this morning we wake to pale muslin",
    "stretched across the grass.",
    "The pumpkins, still in the fields, are planets",
    "shrouded by clouds.",
    "The Weber wears a dunce cap",
    "and sits in the corner by the garage",
    "where asters wrap scarves",
    "around their necks to warm their blooms.",
    "The leaves, still soldered to their branches",
    "by a frozen drop of dew, splash",
    "apple and pear paint along the roadsides.",
    "It seems we have glanced out a window",
    "into the near future, mid-December, say,",
    "the black and white photo of winter",
    "carefully laid over the present autumn,",
    "like a morning we pause at the mirror",
    "inspecting the single strand of hair",
    "that overnight has turned to snow."
