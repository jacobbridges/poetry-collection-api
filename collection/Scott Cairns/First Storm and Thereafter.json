    "What I notice first within",
    "this rough scene fixed",
    "in memory is the rare",
    "quality of its lightning, as if",
    "those bolts were clipped",
    "from a comic book, pasted",
    "on low cloud, or fashioned",
    "with cardboard, daubed",
    "with gilt then hung overhead",
    "on wire and fine hooks.",
    "What I hear most clearly",
    "within that thunder now",
    "is its grief\u2014a moan, a long",
    "lament echoing, an ache.",
    "And the rain? Raucous enough,",
    "pounding, but oddly",
    "musical, and, well,",
    "eager to entertain, solicitous.",
    "No storm since has been framed",
    "with such matter-of-fact",
    "artifice, nor to such comic",
    "effect. No, the thousand-plus",
    "storms since then have turned",
    "increasingly artless,",
    "arbitrary, bearing\u2014every",
    "one of them\u2014a numbing burst.",
    "And today, from the west a gust",
    "and a filling pressure",
    "pulsing in the throat\u2014offering",
    "little or nothing to make light of."
