    "This morning the world\u2019s white face reminds us",
    "that life intends to become serious again.",
    "And the same loud birds that all summer long",
    "annoyed us with their high attitudes and chatter",
    "silently line the gibbet of the fence a little stunned,",
    "chastened enough.",
    "They look as if they\u2019re waiting for things",
    "to grow worse, but are watching the house,",
    "as if somewhere in their dim memories",
    "they recall something about this abandoned garden",
    "that could save them.",
    "The neighbor\u2019s dog has also learned to wake",
    "without exaggeration. And the neighbor himself",
    "has made it to his car with less noise, starting",
    "the small engine with a kind of reverence. At the window",
    "his wife witnesses this bleak tableau, blinking",
    "her eyes, silent.",
    "I fill the feeders to the top and cart them",
    "to the tree, hurrying back inside",
    "to leave the morning to these ridiculous",
    "birds, who, reminded, find the rough shelters,",
    "bow, and then feed."
