    "Not your ordinary ice cream, though the glaze",
    "of these skeletal figures affects",
    "the disposition of those grinning candies",
    "one finds in Mexico, say, at the start of November,",
    "though here, each face is troublingly familiar,",
    "exhibits the style adopted just as one declines",
    "any further style\u2014nectar one sips just as he",
    "draws his last, dispassionate breath, becomes",
    "citizen of a less earnest electorate. One learns",
    "in that city finally how to enjoy a confection,",
    "even if a genuine taste for this circumstance",
    "has yet to be acquired, even if it is oneself",
    "whose sugars and oils now avail a composure",
    "which promises never to end, nor to alter."
