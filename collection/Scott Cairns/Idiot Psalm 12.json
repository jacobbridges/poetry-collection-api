    "O Being both far distant and most near,",
    "O Lover embracing all unlovable, O Tender",
    "Tether binding us together, and binding, yea",
    "and tenderly, Your Person to ourselves,",
    "Being both beyond our ken, and kindred, One",
    "whose dire energies invest such clay as ours",
    "with patent animation, O Secret One secreting",
    "life anew into our every tissue moribund,",
    "afresh unto our stale and stalling craft,",
    "grant in this obscurity a little light."
