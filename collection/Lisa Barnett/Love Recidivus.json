    "Whatever it may be, we may suppose",
    "it is not love, for love must leave its trace",
    "like contraband seized and displayed in rows;",
    "is not sufficient reason to erase",
    "the careful lives we have so far lived through\u2014",
    "there is no call for us to undermine",
    "the walls we've built; no need to think anew",
    "of all the chains and choices that define",
    "us still. And yet for all our fine intent",
    "a single touch ignites the night and tries",
    "resolve past all resisting. What we meant",
    "before we mean again; fidelities",
    "have yet been known to shift and come undone",
    "and all good reasons fail us, one by one."
