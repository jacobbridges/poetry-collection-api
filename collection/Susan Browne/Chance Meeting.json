    "I know him, that man",
    "walking- toward me up the crowded street",
    "of the city, I have lived with him",
    "seven years now, I know his fast stride,",
    "his windy wheatfield hair, his hands thrust",
    "deep in his jacket pockets, hands",
    "that have known my body, touched",
    "its softest part, caused its quick shudders",
    "and slow releasings, I have seen his face",
    "above my face, his mouth smiling, moaning",
    "his eyes closed and opened, I have studied",
    "his eyes, the brown turning gold at the centers,",
    "I have silently watched him lying beside me",
    "in the early morning, I know his loneliness,",
    "like mine, human and sad,",
    "but different, too, his private pain",
    "and pleasure I can never enter even as he comes",
    "closer, past trees and cars, trash and flowers,",
    "steam rising from the manhole covers,",
    "gutters running with rain, he lifts his head,",
    "he sees me, we are strangers again,",
    "and a rending music of desire and loss\u2014",
    "I don\u2019t know him\u2014courses through me,",
    "and we kiss and say,",
    "as if we haven\u2019t seen each other in years",
    "when it was just a few hours ago,",
    "and we are shy, then, not knowing",
    "what to say next."
