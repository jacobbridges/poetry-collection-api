    "Why do you shiver there",
    "Between the white river and the road?",
    "You are not cold,",
    "With the sun light dreaming about you;",
    "And yet you lift your pliant supplicating arms as though",
    "To draw clouds from the sky to hide your slenderness.",
    "You are a young girl",
    "Trembling in the throes of ecstatic modesty,",
    "A white objective girl",
    "Whose clothing has been forcibly taken away from her."
