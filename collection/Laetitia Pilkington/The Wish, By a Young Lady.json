    "I ask not wit, nor beauty do I crave,",
    "Nor wealth, nor pompous titles wish to have;",
    "But since, 'tis doomed through all degrees of life,",
    "Whether a daughter, sister, or a wife;",
    "That females should the stronger males obey,",
    "And yield implicit to their lordly sway;",
    "Since this, I say, is ev'ry woman's fate,",
    "Give me a mind to suit my slavish state."
