    "Now you have freely given me leave to love,",
    "What will you do?",
    "Shall I your mirth, or passion move,",
    "When I begin to woo;",
    "Will you torment, or scorn, or love me too?",
    "Each petty beauty can disdain, and I",
    "Spite of your hate",
    "Without your leave can see, and die;",
    "Dispense a nobler fate!",
    "\u2019Tis easy to destroy, you may create.",
    "Then give me leave to love, and love me too",
    "Not with design",
    "To raise, as Love\u2019s cursed rebels do,",
    "When puling poets whine,",
    "Fame to their beauty, from their blubbered eyne.",
    "Grief is a puddle, and reflects not clear",
    "Your beauty\u2019s rays;",
    "Joys are pure streams, your eyes appear",
    "Sullen in sadder lays;",
    "In cheerful numbers they shine bright with praise,",
    "Which shall not mention to express you fair,",
    "Wounds, flames, and darts,",
    "Storms in your brow, nets in your hair,",
    "Suborning all your parts,",
    "Or to betray, or torture captive hearts.",
    "I\u2019ll make your eyes like morning suns appear,",
    "As mild, and fair;",
    "Your brow as crystal smooth, and clear,",
    "And your disheveled hair",
    "Shall flow like a calm region of the air."
