    "Ask me no more where Jove bestows,",
    "When June is past, the fading rose;",
    "For in your beauty's orient deep",
    "These flowers as in their causes, sleep.",
    "Ask me no more whither doth stray",
    "The golden atoms of the day;",
    "For in pure love heaven did prepare",
    "Those powders to enrich your hair.",
    "Ask me no more whither doth haste",
    "The nightingale when May is past;",
    "For in your sweet dividing throat",
    "She winters and keeps warm her note.",
    "Ask me no more where those stars light",
    "That downwards fall in dead of night;",
    "For in your eyes they sit, and there,",
    "Fixed become as in their sphere.",
    "Ask me no more if east or west",
    "The phoenix builds her spicy nest;",
    "For unto you at last she flies,",
    "And in your fragrant bosom dies."
