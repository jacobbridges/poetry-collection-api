    "He that loves a rosy cheek,",
    "Or a coral lip admires,",
    "Or from star-like eyes doth seek",
    "Fuel to maintain his fires;",
    "As old Time makes these decay,",
    "So his flames must waste away.",
    "But a smooth and steadfast mind,",
    "Gentle thoughts and calm desires,",
    "Hearts with equal love combin'd,",
    "Kindle never-dying fires.",
    "Where these are not, I despise",
    "Lovely cheeks, or lips, or eyes.",
    "No tears, Celia, now shall win",
    "My resolv'd heart to return;",
    "I have search'd thy soul within,",
    "And find nought, but pride, and scorn;",
    "I have learn'd thy arts, and now",
    "Can disdain as much as thou.",
    "Some power, in my revenge, convey",
    "That love to her I cast away."
