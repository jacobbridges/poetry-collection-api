    "Like Gorky, I sometimes follow my doubts",
    "outside to the yard and question the sky,",
    "longing to have the fight settled, thinking",
    "I can't go on like this, and finally I say",
    "all right, it is improbable, all right, there",
    "is no God. And then as if I'm focusing",
    "a magnifying glass on dry leaves, God blazes up.",
    "It's the attention, maybe, to what isn't there",
    "that makes the emptiness flare like a forest fire",
    "until I have to spend the afternoon dragging",
    "the hose to put the smoldering thing out.",
    "Even on an ordinary day when a friend calls,",
    "tells me they've found melanoma,",
    "complains that the hospital is cold, I say God.",
    "God, I say as my heart turns inside out.",
    "Pick up any language by the scruff of its neck,",
    "wipe its face, set it down on the lawn,",
    "and I bet it will toddle right into the godfire",
    "again, which\u2014though they say it doesn't",
    "exist\u2014can send you straight to the burn unit.",
    "Oh, we have only so many words to think with.",
    "Say God's not fire, say anything, say God's",
    "a phone, maybe. You know you didn't order a phone,",
    "but there it is. It rings. You don't know who it could be.",
    "You don't want to talk, so you pull out",
    "the plug. It rings. You smash it with a hammer",
    "till it bleeds springs and coils and clobbery",
    "metal bits. It rings again. You pick it up",
    "and a voice you love whispers hello."
