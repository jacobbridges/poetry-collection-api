    "This tiny ruin in my eye, small",
    "flaw in the fabric, little speck",
    "of blood in the egg, deep chip",
    "in the windshield, north star,",
    "polestar, floater that doesn't",
    "float, spot where my hand is not,",
    "even when I'm looking at my hand,",
    "little piton that nails every rock",
    "I see, no matter if the picture",
    "turns to sand, or sand to sea,",
    "I embrace you, piece of absence",
    "that reminds me what I will be,",
    "all dark some day unless God",
    "rescues me, oh speck",
    "that might teach me yet to see."
