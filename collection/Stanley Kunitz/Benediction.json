    "God banish from your house",
    "The fly, the roach, the mouse",
    "That riots in the walls",
    "Until the plaster falls;",
    "Admonish from your door",
    "The hypocrite and liar;",
    "No shy, soft, tigrish fear",
    "Permit upon your stair,",
    "Nor agents of your doubt.",
    "God drive them whistling out.",
    "Let nothing touched with evil,",
    "Let nothing that can shrivel",
    "Heart's tenderest frond, intrude",
    "Upon your still, deep blood.",
    "Against the drip of night",
    "God keep all windows tight,",
    "Protect your mirrors from",
    "Surprise, delirium,",
    "Admit no trailing wind",
    "Into your shuttered mind",
    "To plume the lake of sleep",
    "With dreams. If you must weep",
    "God give you tears, but leave",
    "You secrecy to grieve,",
    "And islands for your pride,",
    "And love to nest in your side."
