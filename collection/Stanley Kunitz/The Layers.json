    "I have walked through many lives,",
    "some of them my own,",
    "and I am not who I was,",
    "though some principle of being",
    "abides, from which I struggle",
    "not to stray.",
    "When I look behind,",
    "as I am compelled to look",
    "before I can gather strength",
    "to proceed on my journey,",
    "I see the milestones dwindling",
    "toward the horizon",
    "and the slow fires trailing",
    "from the abandoned camp-sites,",
    "over which scavenger angels",
    "wheel on heavy wings.",
    "Oh, I have made myself a tribe",
    "out of my true affections,",
    "and my tribe is scattered!",
    "How shall the heart be reconciled",
    "to its feast of losses?",
    "In a rising wind",
    "the manic dust of my friends,",
    "those who fell along the way,",
    "bitterly stings my face.",
    "Yet I turn, I turn,",
    "exulting somewhat,",
    "with my will intact to go",
    "wherever I need to go,",
    "and every stone on the road",
    "precious to me.",
    "In my darkest night,",
    "when the moon was covered",
    "and I roamed through wreckage,",
    "a nimbus-clouded voice",
    "directed me:",
    "\u201cLive in the layers,",
    "not on the litter.\u201d",
    "Though I lack the art",
    "to decipher it,",
    "no doubt the next chapter",
    "in my book of transformations",
    "is already written.",
    "I am not done with my changes."
