    "An agitation of the air,",
    "A perturbation of the light",
    "Admonished me the unloved year",
    "Would turn on its hinge that night.",
    "I stood in the disenchanted field",
    "Amid the stubble and the stones,",
    "Amazed, while a small worm lisped to me",
    "The song of my marrow-bones.",
    "Blue poured into summer blue,",
    "A hawk broke from his cloudless tower,",
    "The roof of the silo blazed, and I knew",
    "That part of my life was over.",
    "Already the iron door of the north",
    "Clangs open: birds, leaves, snows",
    "Order their populations forth,",
    "And a cruel wind blows."
