    "in the dining car crammed with parkas and laptops",
    "micro-waved cellophane, plastic plates and canvas bags,",
    "and the valley under fog as the cows disappeared",
    "and when the green came back into view I could see",
    "the SUVs floating on the Thruway, the cows oblivious",
    "to the revved engines of trucks. The river glistened",
    "all the way to Albany, and I could see flags on Baptist churches",
    "and resurrection trailers, \u201cGod Bless America\u201d on pick-ups\u2014",
    "\u201cUnited We Stand\u201d laminated to billboards",
    "as the fog settled then lifted, and when I woke",
    "a flag the size of a football field hung from the gray tower of the GW,",
    "where the tractor-trailers jammed beneath its hem",
    "as something sifted down on the silver-plated Hudson.",

    "I wanted to buy the Frankenthaler, a modest, early print,",

    "but I didn't stop, and when the train reached the Stock Exchange",
    "the Yom Kippur streets were quiet, and the bronze statue of Washington",
    "was camouflaged by national guard. I was walking my old mail route now",
    "like a drunk knocking into people, almost hit by a cab",
    "until the roped-off streets cut me at the arm. At Broadway and Liberty",
    "the fences wound around the bursts of dust rising",
    "over the cranes and bulldozers, over the punched-out windows\u2014",
    "I stared through a piece of rusted grid that stood like a gate to the crystal river.",
    "I was sweating in my sweatshirt now, the hood filling with soot,",
    "as I watched with others drinking Cokes and eating their pizza of disbelief.",
    "Zero began with the Sumerians who made circles with hollow reeds",
    "in wet clay and baked them for posterity.",
    "At Broadway and Liberty. At 20 floors charred and standing.",
    "At miasma people weeping. Anna's Nail Salon, Daikichi Sushi,",
    "the vacant shops, stripped clean in the graffiti of dust-coated windows.",
    "Something blasted from a boom box in a music store,",
    "something, in the ineffable clips of light,",
    "disappeared over the river."
