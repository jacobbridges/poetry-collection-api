    "I found her broken nerves,",

    "the pried-open spaces between vowels",
    "where the teeth bit off twine",

    "in the stockroom I could read alone\u2014",
    "the confetti of money dissolved on the blank wall.",
    "After work, I slid the numbered poems",
    "on blue mimeo into my playbook,",
    "and felt the open field",
    "the zig-zagging past cornerbacks,",
    "the white lines skewed to heaven.",
    "Excuse my mood\u2014unbridled, chemical,",
    "her scrawled messages smooth to the mind,",
    "excuse my absence, again and yes, then, too\u2014",
    "the cold stone of the Palisades was there",
    "after we split\u2014",
    "alone naked in the Hudson,",
    "the water greasing me in the tepid, chemical mix,",
    "before I returned",
    "to the cement of 9W in my father\u2019s Skylark",
    "the night black and soundless within."
