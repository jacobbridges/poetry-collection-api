    "Out of the winds' and the waves' riot,",
    "Out of the loud foam,",
    "He has put in to a great quiet",
    "And a still home.",
    "Here he may lie at ease and wonder",
    "Why the old ship waits,",
    "And hark for the surge and the strong thunder",
    "Of the full Straits,",
    "And look for the fishing fleet at morning,",
    "Shadows like lost souls,",
    "Slide through the fog where the seal's warning",
    "Betrays the shoals,",
    "And watch for the deep-sea liner climbing",
    "Out of the bright West,",
    "With a salmon-sky and her wake shining",
    "Like a tern's breast, \u0097",
    "And never know he is done for ever",
    "With the old sea's pride,",
    "Borne from the fight and the full endeavour",
    "On an ebb tide."
