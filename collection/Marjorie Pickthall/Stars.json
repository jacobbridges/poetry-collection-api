    "Now in the West the slender moon lies low,",
    "And now Orion glimmers through the trees,",
    "Clearing the earth with even pace and slow,",
    "And now the stately-moving Pleiades,",
    "In that soft infinite darkness overhead",
    "Hang jewel-wise upon a silver thread.",
    "And all the lonelier stars that have their place,",
    "Calm lamps within the distant southern sky,",
    "And planet-dust upon the edge of space,",
    "Look down upon the fretful world, and I",
    "Look up to outer vastness unafraid",
    "And see the stars which sang when earth was made."
