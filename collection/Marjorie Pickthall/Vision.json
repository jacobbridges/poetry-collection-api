    "I have not walked on common ground,",
    "Nor drunk of earthly streams;",
    "A shining figure, mailed and crowned,",
    "Moves softly through my dreams.",
    "He makes the air so keen and strange,",
    "The stars so fiercely bright;",
    "The rocks of time, the tides of change,",
    "Are nothing in his sight.",
    "Death lays no shadow on his smile;",
    "Life is a race fore-run;",
    "Look in his face a little while,",
    "And life and death are one."
