    "Give me a few more hours to pass",
    "With the mellow flower of the elm-bough falling,",
    "And then no more than the lonely grass",
    "And the birds calling.",
    "Give me a few more days to keep",
    "With a little love and a little sorrow,",
    "And then the dawn in the skies of sleep",
    "And a clear to-morrow.",
    "Give me a few more years to fill",
    "With a little work and a little lending,",
    "And then the night on a starry hill",
    "And the road's ending."
