    "I gave my thoughts a golden peach,",
    "A silver citron tree;",
    "They clustered dumbly out of reach",
    "And would not sing for me.",
    "I built my thoughts a roof of rush,",
    "A little byre beside;",
    "They left my music to the thrush",
    "And flew at eveningtide.",
    "I went my way and would not care",
    "If they should come and go;",
    "A thousand birds seemed up in air,",
    "My thoughts were singing so."
