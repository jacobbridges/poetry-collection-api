    "My mother sleeps with the Bible open on her pillow;",
    "she reads herself to sleep and wakens startled.",
    "She listens for her heart: each breath is shallow.",
    "For years her hands were quick with thread and needle.",
    "She used to sew all night when we were little;",
    "now she sleeps with the Bible on her pillow",
    "and believes that Jesus understands her sorrow:",
    "her children grown, their father frail and brittle;",
    "she stitches in her heart, her breathing shallow.",
    "Once she",
    ", rushed tomorrow,",
    "mornings full of sunlight, sons and daughters.",
    "Now she sleeps alone with the Bible on her pillow",
    "and wakes alone and feels the house is hollow,",
    "though my father in his blue room stirs and mutters;",
    "she listens to him breathe: each breath is shallow.",
    "I flutter down the darkened hallway, shadow",
    "between their dreams, my mother and my father,",
    "asleep in rooms I pass, my breathing shallow.",
    "I leave the Bible open on her pillow."
