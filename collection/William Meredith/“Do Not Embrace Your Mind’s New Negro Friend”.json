    "Do not embrace your mind\u2019s new negro friend",
    "Or embarrass the blackballed jew with memberships:",
    "There must be years of atonement first, and even then",
    "You may still be the blundering raconteur",
    "With the wrong story, and they may still be free.",
    "If you are with them, if even mind is friend,",
    "There will be plenty to do: give the liars lessons",
    "Who have heard no rumors of truth for a long time",
    "But have whatever they hear on good authority,",
    "Whether it concerns Chinese women or the arts.",
    "Expose the patrons, some of whose best friends",
    "Are brothers, and who are never now anonymous:",
    "What kind of credit do they expect for that,",
    "Ask them, or better, ask their protested brothers,",
    "The grateful tenants who can\u2019t get their curtsies right.",
    "Finally the injured, who think they have no friend,",
    "Who have been convinced by the repeated names",
    "That they are jews or negroes or some dark thing:",
    "They must be courted with the lover\u2019s touch",
    "And as guiltily as if yourself had turned them inward.",
    "If you complete this program, you will have friends",
    "From all the rich races of your human blood:",
    "Meantime, engage in the often friendless struggle.",
    "A long war, a pygmy war in ways,",
    "But island by island we must go across."
