    "on the trains to the death camps were seized",
    "by irrational lust. She is the youngest woman",

    "He stands in the doorway. Forsythia and lilac",
    "have overgrown the porch, there is the rich",
    "smell of wood-rot. What twenty years will do",
    "to untended shrubbery and America and Hazard."
