    "In the old, scratched, cheap wood of the typing stand",
    "there is a landscape, veined, which only a child can see",
    "or the child\u2019s older self, a poet,",
    "a woman dreaming when she should be typing",
    "the last report of the day. If this were a map,",
    "she thinks, a map laid down to memorize",
    "because she might be walking it, it shows",
    "ridge upon ridge fading into hazed desert",
    "here and there a sign of aquifers",
    "and one possible watering-hole. If this were a map",
    "it would be the map of the last age of her life,",
    "not a map of choices but a map of variations",
    "on the one great choice. It would be the map by which",
    "she could see the end of touristic choices,",
    "of distances blued and purpled by romance,",
    "by which she would recognize that poetry",
    "isn\u2019t revolution but a way of knowing",
    "why it must come. If this cheap, mass-produced",
    "wooden stand from the Brooklyn Union Gas Co.,",
    "mass-produced yet durable, being here now,",
    "is what it is yet a dream-map",
    "so obdurate, so plain,",
    "she thinks, the material and the dream can join",
    "and that is the poem and that is the late report."
