    "Lady, take care; for in the diamond eyes",
    "Of old old men is figured your undoing;",
    "Love is turned in behind the wrinkled lids",
    "To nurse their fear and scorn at their near going.",
    "Flesh hangs like the curtains in a house",
    "Long unused, damp as cellars without wine;",
    "They are the future of us all, when we",
    "Will be dried-leaf-thin, the sour whine",
    "Of a siren\u2019s diminuendo. They have no past",
    "But egg husks shattered to a rubbish heap",
    "By memory\u2019s looting. Do not follow them",
    "To their camp pitched in a cranny, do not keep",
    "To the road for them, a weary weary yard",
    "Will bring you in; that beckoning host ahead,",
    "Inn-keeper Death, has but to lift his hat",
    "To topple the oldster in the dust. Read,",
    "Poor old man, the sensual moral; sleep",
    "Narrow in your bed, wear no",
    "More so bright a rose in your lapel;",
    "The spell of the world is loosed, it is time to go."
