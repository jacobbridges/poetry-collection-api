    "We came so trustingly, for love, but these",
    "Lowlands, flatlands, near beneath the sea",
    "Point with their cautionary bones of sand",
    "To exorcize, submerge us; we stay free",
    "Only as mermaids glittering in the waves:",
    "Mermaids of the imagination, young",
    "A spring ago, who know our loveliness",
    "Banished, like fireflies at winter\u2019s breath,",
    "Because none saw; these vines about our necks",
    "We placed in welcome once, but now as wreath",
    "Against the scalpel cold; still cold creeps in",
    "To grow like ivy over our chilling bodies",
    "Into our blood. Now in our diamond dress",
    "We wive only the sequins of the sea.",
    "The lowlands have rejected us. They lie",
    "Athwart the whispering waters like a scar",
    "On a mirage of glass; the dooming land,",
    "Where nothing can take root but frost, has won.",
    "And what of warmth and what of joy? They are",
    "Sequestered elsewhere, southward, where the sun",
    "Speaks. For all our mermaid vigilance",
    "And balance, all goes under; underneath",
    "The land\u2019s gray wave we falter and fall back",
    "To hibernate within the caves of death."
