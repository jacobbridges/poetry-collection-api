    "Were there a tear",
    "To spare, where better",
    "To be sure the gesture",
    "Would linger than here",
    "In its own little bottle",
    "Blown from a hot bubble",
    "To mirror a tear.",
    "And were there more",
    "Than one could bear,",
    "So much the better",
    "In the hereafter for",
    "The begetter, a little",
    "Vessel to stopper",
    "Sorrow beyond measure.",
    "And were there a tear",
    "Too few, far better to hire",
    "A weeper, for where",
    "But in a tearful little",
    "Jigger does it figure",
    "No one need settle for",
    "Less than a fair share."
