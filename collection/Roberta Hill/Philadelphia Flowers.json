    "In the cubbyhole entrance to Cornell and Son,",
    "a woman in a turquoise sweater",
    "curls up to sleep. Her right arm seeks",
    "a cold spot in the stone to release its worry",
    "and her legs stretch",
    "against the middle hinge.",
    "I want to ask her in for coffee,",
    "to tell her go sleep in the extra bed upstairs,",
    "but I\u2019m a guest,",
    "unaccustomed to this place",
    "where homeless people drift along the square",
    "bordering Benjamin Franklin Parkway.",
    "From her portrait on the mantel,",
    "Lucretia Mott asks when",
    "will Americans see",
    "how all forms of oppression blight",
    "the possibilities of a people.",
    "The passion for preserving Independence Square",
    "should reach this nameless woman, settling",
    "in the heavy heat of August,",
    "exposed to the glare of every passerby.",
    "What makes property so private? A fence?",
    "No trespassing signs? Militia ready to die for it",
    "and taxes? Lights in the middle storeys",
    "of office buildings blaze all night above me.",
    "Newspapers don\u2019t explain how wealth",
    "is bound to these broken people.",
    "North of here, things get really rough.",
    "Longshoremen out of work bet on eddies",
    "in the Schuylkill River.",
    "Factories collapse to weed",
    "and ruptured dream. Years ago, Longhouse sachems",
    "rode canoes to Philadelphia,",
    "entering these red brick halls.",
    "They explained how",
    "the law that kept them unified",
    "required a way to share the wealth.",
    "Inside the hearths of these same halls,",
    "such knowledge was obscured,",
    "and plans were laid to push all Indians ,",
    "west. This city born of brotherly love",
    "still turns around this conflict.",
    "Deeper in the dusk,",
    "William Penn must weep",
    "from his perch on top of City Hall.",
    "Our leaders left this woman in the lurch.",
    "How can there be democracy",
    "without the means to live?",
    "Every fifteen minutes",
    "a patrol car cruises by. I jolt awake",
    "at four a.m. to sirens screeching",
    "and choppers lugging to the hospital heliport",
    "someone who wants to breathe.",
    "The sultry heat leads me",
    "to the window. What matters? This small",
    "square of night sky and two trees",
    "bound by a wide brick wall.",
    "All around, skyscrapers",
    "are telling their stories",
    "under dwindling stars. The girders",
    "remember where Mohawk ironworkers stayed",
    "that day they sat after work",
    "on a balcony, drinking beer.",
    "Below them, a film crew caught",
    "some commercials. In another room above",
    "a mattress caught fire and someone flung it",
    "down into the frame. A woman in blue",
    "sashayed up the street",
    "while a flaming mattress,",
    "falling at the same speed as a flower,",
    "bloomed over her left shoulder.",
    "Every fifteen minutes",
    "a patrol car cruises by. The men inside",
    "mean business. They understood the scene.",
    "A mattress burning in the street",
    "and business deadlocked. Mohawks",
    "drinking beer above it all.",
    "They radioed insurrection,",
    "drew their guns, then three-stepped",
    "up the stairs. Film crews caught the scene,",
    "but it never played. The Mohawks",
    "didn\u2019t guess a swat team had moved in.",
    "When policemen blasted off their door,",
    "the terrified men shoved a table",
    "against the splintered frame.",
    "They fought it out.",
    "One whose name meant Deer got shot",
    "again and again. They let him lie",
    "before they dragged him by his heels",
    "down four flights of stairs. At every step,",
    "he hurdled above his pain",
    "until one final leap",
    "gained him the stars.",
    "The news reported one cop broke his leg.",
    "The film\u2019s been banished to a vault. There are",
    "no plaques. But girders whisper at night",
    "in Philadelphia. They know the boarding house,",
    "but will not say. They know as well what lasts",
    "and what falls down.",
    "Passing Doric colonnades of banks",
    "and walls of dark glass,",
    "passing press-the-button-visitors-please",
    "Liberty Townhouses, I turned",
    "up Broad Street near the Hershey Hotel",
    "and headed toward the doorman",
    "outside the Bellevue. Palms and chandeliers inside.",
    "A woman in mauve silk and pearls stepped into the street.",
    "I was tracking my Mohawk grandmother",
    "through time. She left a trace",
    "of her belief somewhere near Locust and Thirteenth.",
    "I didn\u2019t see you, tall, dark, intense,",
    "with three bouquets of flowers in your hand.",
    "On Walnut and Broad, between the Union League",
    "and the Indian Campsite, you stopped me,",
    "shoving flowers toward my arm.",
    "\u201cAt least, I\u2019m not begging,\u201d you cried.",
    "The desperation in your voice",
    "spiraled through my feet while I fumbled the few bucks",
    "you asked for. I wanted those flowers\u2014",
    "iris, ageratum, goldenrod and lilies\u2014",
    "because in desperation",
    "you thought of beauty. I recognized",
    "the truth and human love you acted on,",
    "your despair echoing my own.",
    "Forgive me. I should have bought more",
    "of those Philadelphia flowers, passed hand",
    "to hand so quickly, I was stunned a block away.",
    "You had to keep your pride, as I have done,",
    "selling these bouquets of poems",
    "to anyone who\u2019ll take them. After our exchange,",
    "grandmother\u2019s tracks grew clearer.",
    "I returned for days, but you were never there.",
    "If you see her \u2014 small, dark, intense,",
    "with a bun of black hair and the gaze of an orphan,",
    "leave a petal in my path.",
    "Then I\u2019ll know I can go on.",
    "Some days you get angry enough",
    "to question. There\u2019s a plan out east",
    "with a multitude of charts and diagrams.",
    "They planned to take the timber, the good soil.",
    "Even now, they demolish mountains.",
    "Next they\u2019ll want the water and the air.",
    "I tell you they\u2019re planning to leave our reservations",
    "bare of life. They plan to dump their toxic",
    "wastes on our grandchildren. No one wants to say",
    "how hard they\u2019ve worked a hundred years.",
    "What of you, learning how this continent\u2019s",
    "getting angry? Do you consider what\u2019s in store for you?"
