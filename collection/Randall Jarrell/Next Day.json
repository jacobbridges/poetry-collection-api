    "Moving from Cheer to Joy, from Joy to All,",
    "I take a box",
    "And add it to my wild rice, my Cornish game hens.",
    "The slacked or shorted, basketed, identical",
    "Food-gathering flocks",
    "Are selves I overlook. Wisdom, said William James,",
    "Is learning what to overlook. And I am wise",
    "If that is wisdom.",
    "Yet somehow, as I buy All from these shelves",
    "And the boy takes it to my station wagon,",
    "What I\u2019ve become",
    "Troubles me even if I shut my eyes.",
    "When I was young and miserable and pretty",
    "And poor, I\u2019d wish",
    "What all girls wish: to have a husband,",
    "A house and children. Now that I\u2019m old, my wish",
    "Is womanish:",
    "That the boy putting groceries in my car",
    "See me. It bewilders me he doesn\u2019t see me.",
    "For so many years",
    "I was good enough to eat: the world looked at me",
    "And its mouth watered. How often they have undressed me,",
    "The eyes of strangers!",
    "And, holding their flesh within my flesh, their vile",
    "Imaginings within my imagining,",
    "I too have taken",
    "The chance of life. Now the boy pats my dog",
    "And we start home. Now I am good.",
    "The last mistaken,",
    "Ecstatic, accidental bliss, the blind",
    "Happiness that, bursting, leaves upon the palm",
    "Some soap and water\u2014",
    "It was so long ago, back in some Gay",
    "Twenties, Nineties, I don\u2019t know . . . Today I miss",
    "My lovely daughter",
    "Away at school, my sons away at school,",
    "My husband away at work\u2014I wish for them.",
    "The dog, the maid,",
    "And I go through the sure unvarying days",
    "At home in them. As I look at my life,",
    "I am afraid",
    "Only that it will change, as I am changing:",
    "I am afraid, this morning, of my face.",
    "It looks at me",
    "From the rear-view mirror, with the eyes I hate,",
    "The smile I hate. Its plain, lined look",
    "Of gray discovery",
    "Repeats to me: \u201cYou\u2019re old.\u201d That\u2019s all, I\u2019m old.",
    "And yet I\u2019m afraid, as I was at the funeral",
    "I went to yesterday.",
    "My friend\u2019s cold made-up face, granite among its flowers,",
    "Her undressed, operated-on, dressed body",
    "Were my face and body.",
    "As I think of her and I hear her telling me",
    "How young I seem; I am exceptional;",
    "I think of all I have.",
    "But really no one is exceptional,",
    "No one has anything, I\u2019m anybody,",
    "I stand beside my grave",
    "Confused with my life, that is commonplace and solitary."
