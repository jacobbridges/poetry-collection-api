    "If, in an odd angle of the hutment,",
    "A puppy laps the water from a can",
    "Of flowers, and the drunk sergeant shaving",

    "\u2014shall I say that man",
    "Is not as men have said: a wolf to man?",
    "The other murderers troop in yawning;",
    "Three of them play Pitch, one sleeps, and one",
    "Lies counting missions, lies there sweating",
    "Till even his heart beats: One; One; One.",
    "... Still, this is how it\u2019s done:",
    "This is a war.... But since these play, before they die,",
    "Like puppies with their puppy; since, a man,",
    "I did as these have done, but did not die\u2014",
    "I will content the people as I can",
    "And give up these to them: Behold the man!",
    "I have suffered, in a dream, because of him,",
    "Many things; for this last saviour, man,",
    "I have lied as I lie now. But what is lying?",
    "Men wash their hands, in blood, as best they can:",
    "I find no fault in this just man."
