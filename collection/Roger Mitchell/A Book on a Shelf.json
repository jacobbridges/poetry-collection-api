    "A history of some sort, one that made us,",
    "a war and what the war had meant, or since",
    "meaning eludes war, what it did to the look",
    "of the trees and the sides of the buildings,",
    "most of which survived, only to be torn down",
    "later to widen the street or put up a new",
    "office complex. There it was on the shelf.",
    "I was there only a moment, but still,",
    "I wanted to know what happened to the man",
    "in the photograph wearing a flat cap",
    "standing outside the important building",
    "cheering. He was there. He was part of that",
    "moment, one of the first into the streets",
    "when the turn of events came, the declaration",
    "or pronouncement, words that would change",
    "the look of everything he smiled on, words",
    "that may have cost him his life. Here it is",
    "in a book I found on a shelf. The person",
    "who lives here bought it at a library",
    "stock reduction sale. No one had read it.",
    "It looked interesting thirty years ago.",
    "It was practically new, the back uncracked.",
    "But the person did what those before her had,",
    "put it up on a shelf and never found",
    "a way back to it. The history sits there,",
    "unread, unbelievable, somebody else's.",
    "Even I have only looked at the pictures,",
    "at the man smiling between the cold pages.",
    "Maybe ending the world as he knew it",
    "was ok. Maybe it was the only way.",
    "Maybe the world has to come to an end",
    "in the first place to be the world. And the man?",
    "He has to smile, though he knows so little",
    "of what's coming, even looking right at it.",
    "As we do, who still haven't read the book."
