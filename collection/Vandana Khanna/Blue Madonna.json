    "Back before color threaded",
    "the world, when everything",
    "was in black-and-white, I was",
    "the only pagan at school, hiding",
    "my breath with its curry and accent,",
    "mouthing words to prayers I didn't",
    "understand. I wondered why there",
    "were always holy men but so few holy",
    "women. I wanted to be enchanted,",
    "to steal the baby Jesus from the Christmas",
    "play and keep him hidden in my closet,",
    "pull him out when I needed to be saved.",
    "I wanted to be the blue Madonna holding",
    "all the pieces of her son together.",
    "Half a world away, girls my age came",
    "as close to God as anyone could be.",
    "They were already throwing their bodies",
    "over their husband's funeral pyres, flung",
    "out like blankets over the flames, chanting",
    "like a nursery rhyme. My mother",
    "told me it was a holy mantra, the more I said",
    "it, the holier I would be, but I never really knew",
    "how or why, just that it was supposed to happen.",
    "Once I tried saying it as many times as I could",
    "in fifty seconds, but nothing. No miracle,",
    "no halo of thorns around my head. And all I",
    "could think about were those girls, widows",
    "at fifteen. What did burning flowers smell like?",
    "Something terrible, something holy?"
