    "When the forests have been destroyed their darkness remains",
    "The ash the great walker follows the possessors",
    "Forever",
    "Nothing they will come to is real",
    "Nor for long",
    "Over the watercourses",
    "Like ducks in the time of the ducks",
    "The ghosts of the villages trail in the sky",
    "Making a new twilight",
    "Rain falls into the open eyes of the dead",
    "Again again with its pointless sound",
    "When the moon finds them they are the color of everything",
    "The nights disappear like bruises but nothing is healed",
    "The dead go away like bruises",
    "The blood vanishes into the poisoned farmlands",
    "Pain the horizon",
    "Remains",
    "Overhead the seasons rock",
    "They are paper bells",
    "Calling to nothing living",
    "The possessors move everywhere under Death their star",
    "Like columns of smoke they advance into the shadows",
    "Like thin flames with no light",
    "They with no past",
    "And fire their only future"
