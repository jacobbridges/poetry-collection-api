    "It sounds unconvincing to say",
    "Though I have long wondered what it would be like",
    "To be me now",
    "No older at all it seems from here",
    "As far from myself as ever",
    "Walking in fog and rain and seeing nothing",
    "I imagine all the clocks have died in the night",
    "Now no one is looking I could choose my age",
    "It would be younger I suppose so I am older",
    "It is there at hand I could take it",
    "Except for the things I think I would do differently",
    "They keep coming between they are what I am",
    "They have taught me little I did not know when I was young",
    "There is nothing wrong with my age now probably",
    "It is how I have come to it",
    "Like a thing I kept putting off as I did my youth",
    "There is nothing the matter with speech",
    "Just because it lent itself",
    "To my uses",
    "Of course there is nothing the matter with the stars",
    "It is my emptiness among them",
    "While they drift farther away in the invisible morning"
