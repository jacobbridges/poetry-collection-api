    "When you are already here",
    "you appear to be only",
    "a name that tells of you",
    "whether you are present or not",
    "and for now it seems as though",
    "you are still summer",
    "still the high familiar",
    "endless summer",
    "yet with a glint",
    "of bronze in the chill mornings",
    "and the late yellow petals",
    "of the mullein fluttering",
    "on the stalks that lean",
    "over their broken",
    "shadows across the cracked ground",
    "but they all know",
    "that you have come",
    "the seed heads of the sage",
    "the whispering birds",
    "with nowhere to hide you",
    "to keep you for later",
    "you",
    "who fly with them",
    "you who are neither",
    "before nor after",
    "you who arrive",
    "with blue plums",
    "that have fallen through the night",
    "perfect in the dew"
