    "I gave you sorrow to hang on your wall",
    "Like a calendar in one color.",
    "I wear a torn place on my sleeve.",
    "It isn't as simple as that.",
    "Between no place of mine and no place of yours",
    "You'd have thought I'd know the way by now",
    "Just from thinking it over.",
    "Oh I know",
    "I've no excuse to be stuck here turning",
    "Like a mirror on a string,",
    "Except it's hardly credible how",
    "It all keeps changing.",
    "Loss has a wider choice of directions",
    "Than the other thing.",
    "As if I had a system",
    "I shuffle among the lies",
    "Turning them over, if only",
    "I could be sure what I'd lost.",
    "I uncover my footprints, I",
    "Poke them till the eyes open.",
    "They don't recall what it looked like.",
    "When was I using it last?",
    "Was it like a ring or a light",
    "Or the autumn pond",
    "Which chokes and glitters but",
    "Grows colder?",
    "It could be all in the mind. Anyway",
    "Nothing seems to bring it back to me.",
    "And I've been to see",
    "Your hands as trees borne away on a flood,",
    "The same film over and over,",
    "And an old one at that, shattering its account",
    "To the last of the digits, and nothing",
    "And the blank end.",
    "The lightning has shown me the scars of the future.",
    "I've had a long look at someone",
    "Alone like a key in a lock",
    "Without what it takes to turn.",
    "It isn't as simple as that.",
    "Winter will think back to your lit harvest",
    "For which there is no help, and the seed",
    "Of eloquence will open its wings",
    "When you are gone.",
    "But at this moment",
    "When the nails are kissing the fingers good-bye",
    "And my only",
    "Chance is bleeding from me,",
    "When my one chance is bleeding,",
    "For speaking either truth or comfort",
    "I have no more tongue than a wound."
