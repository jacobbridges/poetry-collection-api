    "Four feet up, under the bruise-blue",
    "Fingered hat-felt, the eyes begin. The sly brim",
    "Slips over the sky, street after street, and nobody",
    "Knows, to stop it. It will cover",
    "The whole world, if there is time. Fifty years\u2019",
    "Start in gray the eyes have; you will never",
    "Catch up to where they are, too clever",
    "And always walking, the legs not long but",
    "The boots big with wide smiles of darkness",
    "Going round and round at their tops, climbing.",
    "They are almost to the knees already, where",
    "There should have been ankles to stop them.",
    "So must keep walking all the time, hurry, for",
    "The black sea is down where the toes are",
    "And swallows and swallows all. A big coat",
    "Can help save you. But eyes push you down; never",
    "Meet eyes. There are hands in hands, and love",
    "Follows its furs into shut doors; who",
    "Shall be killed first? Do not look up there:",
    "The wind is blowing the building-tops, and a hand",
    "Is sneaking the whole sky another way, but",
    "It will not escape. Do not look up. God is",
    "On High. He can see you. You will die."
