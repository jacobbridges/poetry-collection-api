    "Comet of stillness princess of what is over",
    "high note held without trembling without voice without sound",
    "aura of complete darkness keeper of the kept secrets",
    "of the destroyed stories the escaped dreams the sentences",
    "never caught in words warden of where the river went",
    "touch of its surface sibyl of the extinguished",
    "window onto the hidden place and the other time",
    "at the foot of the wall by the road patient without waiting",
    "in the full moonlight of autumn at the hour when I was born",
    "you no longer go out like a flame at the sight of me",
    "you are still warmer than the moonlight gleaming on you",
    "even now you are unharmed even now perfect",
    "as you have always been now when your light paws are running",
    "on the breathless night on the bridge with one end I remember you",
    "when I have heard you the soles of my feet have made answer",
    "when I have seen you I have waked and slipped from the calendars",
    "from the creeds of difference and the contradictions",
    "that were my life and all the crumbling fabrications",
    "as long as it lasted until something that we were",
    "had ended when you are no longer anything",
    "let me catch sight of you again going over the wall",
    "and before the garden is extinct and the woods are figures",
    "guttering on a screen let my words find their own",
    "places in the silence after the animals"
