    "All the way north on the train the sun",
    "followed me followed me without moving",
    "still the sun of that other morning",
    "when we had gone over Come on over",
    "men at the screen door said to my father",
    "You have to see this it\u2019s an ape bring",
    "the little boy bring the boy along",
    "so he brought me along to the field",
    "of dry grass hissing behind the houses",
    "in the heat that morning and there was",
    "nothing else back there but the empty day",
    "above the grass waving as far away",
    "as I could see and the sight burned my eyes",
    "white birds were flying off beyond us",
    "and a raised floor of boards like a house",
    "with no house on it part way out there",
    "was shining by itself a color",
    "of shadow and the voices of the men",
    "were smaller in the field as we walked on",
    "something was standing out there on the floor",
    "the men kept saying Come on over",
    "it\u2019s on a chain and my father said",
    "to me Don\u2019t get too close I saw it was",
    "staring down at each of our faces",
    "one after the other as though it might",
    "catch sight of something in one of them",
    "that it remembered I stood watching its eyes",
    "as they turned away from each of us"
