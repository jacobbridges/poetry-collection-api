    "At times now from some margin of the day",
    "I can hear birds of another country",
    "not the whole song but a brief phrase of it",
    "out of a music that I may have heard",
    "once in a moment I appear to have",
    "forgotten for the most part that full day",
    "no sight of which I can remember now",
    "though it must have been where my eyes were then",
    "that knew it as the present while I thought",
    "of somewhere else without noticing that",
    "singing when it was there and still went on",
    "whether or not I noticed now it falls",
    "silent when I listen and leaves the day",
    "and flies before it to be heard again",
    "somewhere ahead when I have forgotten"
