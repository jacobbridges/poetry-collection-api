    "Matches among other things that were not allowed",
    "never would be",
    "lying high in a cool blue box",

    "bodies clean and smooth blue heads white crowns",
    "white sandpaper on the sides of the box scoring",
    "fire after fire gone before",
    "I could hear the scratch and flare",
    "when they were over",
    "and catch the smell of the striking",
    "I knew what the match would feel like",
    "lighting",
    "when I was very young",
    "a fire engine came and parked",
    "in the shadow of the big poplar tree",
    "on Fourth Street one night",
    "keeping its engine running",
    "pumping oxygen to the old woman",
    "in the basement",
    "when she died the red lights went on burning"
