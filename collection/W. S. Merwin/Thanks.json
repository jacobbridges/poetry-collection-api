    "Listen",
    "with the night falling we are saying thank you",
    "we are stopping on the bridges to bow from the railings",
    "we are running out of the glass rooms",
    "with our mouths full of food to look at the sky",
    "and say thank you",
    "we are standing by the water thanking it",
    "standing by the windows looking out",
    "in our directions",
    "back from a series of hospitals back from a mugging",
    "after funerals we are saying thank you",
    "after the news of the dead",
    "whether or not we knew them we are saying thank you",
    "over telephones we are saying thank you",
    "in doorways and in the backs of cars and in elevators",
    "remembering wars and the police at the door",
    "and the beatings on stairs we are saying thank you",
    "in the banks we are saying thank you",
    "in the faces of the officials and the rich",
    "and of all who will never change",
    "we go on saying thank you thank you",
    "with the animals dying around us",
    "taking our feelings we are saying thank you",
    "with the forests falling faster than the minutes",
    "of our lives we are saying thank you",
    "with the words going out like cells of a brain",
    "with the cities growing over us",
    "we are saying thank you faster and faster",
    "with nobody listening we are saying thank you",
    "thank you we are saying and waving",
    "dark though it is"
