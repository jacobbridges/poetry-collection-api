    "For longer than by now I can believe",
    "I assumed that you had nothing to do",
    "with each other I thought you had arrived",
    "whenever that had been",
    "more solitary than single snowflakes",
    "with no acquaintance or understanding",
    "running among you guiding your footsteps",
    "somewhere ahead of me",
    "in your own time oh white lakes on the maps",
    "that I copied and gaps on the paper",
    "for the names that were to appear in them",
    "sometimes a doorway or",
    "window sometimes an eye sometimes waking",
    "without knowing the place in the whole night",
    "I might have guessed from the order in which",
    "you turned up before me",
    "and from the way I kept looking at you",
    "as though I recognized something in you",
    "that you were all words out of one language",
    "tracks of the same creature"
