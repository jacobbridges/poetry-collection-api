    "Back when it took all day to come up",
    "from the curving broad ponds on the plains",
    "where the green-winged ja\u00e7anas ran on the lily pads",
    "easing past tracks at the mouths of gorges",
    "crossing villages silted in hollows",
    "in the foothills",
    "each with its lime-washed church by the baked square",
    "of red earth and its",
    "talkers eating fruit under trees",
    "turning a corner and catching",
    "sight at last of inky forests far above",
    "steep as faces",
    "with the clouds stroking them and the glimmering",
    "airy valleys opening out of them",
    "waterfalls still roared from the folds",
    "of the mountain",
    "white and thundering and spray drifted",
    "around us swirling into the broad leaves",
    "and the waiting boughs",
    "once I took a tin cup and climbed",
    "the sluiced rocks and mossy branches beside",
    "one of the high falls",
    "looking up step by step into",
    "the green sky from which rain was falling",
    "when I looked back from a ledge there were only",
    "dripping leaves below me",
    "and flowers",
    "beside me the hissing",
    "cataract plunged into the trees",
    "holding on I moved closer",
    "left foot on a rock in the water",
    "right foot on a rock in deeper water",
    "at the edge of the fall",
    "then from under the weight of my right foot",
    "came a voice like a small bell singing",
    "over and over one clear treble",
    "syllable",
    "I could feel it move",
    "I could feel it ring in my foot in my skin",
    "everywhere",
    "in my ears in my hair",
    "I could feel it in my tongue and in the hand",
    "holding the cup",
    "as long as I stood there it went on",
    "without changing",
    "when I moved the cup",
    "still it went on",
    "when I filled the cup",
    "in the falling column",
    "still it went on",
    "when I drank it rang in my eyes",
    "through the thunder curtain",
    "when I filled the cup again",
    "when I raised my foot",
    "still it went on",
    "and all the way down",
    "from wet rock to wet rock",
    "green branch to green branch",
    "it came with me",
    "until I stood",
    "looking up and we drank",
    "the light water",
    "and when we went on we could",
    "still hear the sound",
    "as far as the next turn on the way over"
