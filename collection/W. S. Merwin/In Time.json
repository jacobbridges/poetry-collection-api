    "The night the world was going to end",
    "when we heard those explosions not far away",
    "and the loudspeakers telling us",
    "about the vast fires on the backwater",
    "consuming undisclosed remnants",
    "and warning us over and over",
    "to stay indoors and make no signals",
    "you stood at the open window",
    "the light of one candle back in the room",
    "we put on high boots to be ready",
    "for wherever we might have to go",
    "and we got out the oysters and sat",
    "at the small table feeding them",
    "to each other first with the fork",
    "then from our mouths to each other",
    "until there were none and we stood up",
    "and started to dance without music",
    "slowly we danced around and around",
    "in circles and after a while we hummed",
    "when the world was about to end",
    "all those years all those nights ago"
