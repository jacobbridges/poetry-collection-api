    "I live up here",
    "And a little bit to the left",
    "And I go down only",

    "Every time",
    "Nothing has changed",
    "Oh down there down there",
    "Every time",
    "The glass knights lie by their gloves of blood",
    "In the pans of the scales the helmets",
    "Brim over with water",
    "It's perfectly fair",
    "The pavements are dealt out the dice",
