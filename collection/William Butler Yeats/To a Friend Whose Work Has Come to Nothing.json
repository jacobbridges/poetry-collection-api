    "Now all the truth is out,",
    "Be secret and take defeat",
    "From any brazen throat,",
    "For how can you compete,",
    "Being honor bred, with one",
    "Who were it proved he lies",
    "Were neither shamed in his own",
    "Nor in his neighbors' eyes;",
    "Bred to a harder thing",
    "Than Triumph, turn away",
    "And like a laughing string",
    "Whereon mad fingers play",
    "Amid a place of stone,",
    "Be secret and exult,",
    "Because of all things known",
    "That is most difficult."
