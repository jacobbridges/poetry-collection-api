    "with her would not agree.",
    "In a field by the river",
    "my love and I did stand,",
    "And on my leaning shoulder",
    "she laid her snow-white hand.",
    "She bid me take life easy,",
    "as the grass grows on the weirs;",
    "But I was young and foolish,",
    "and now am full of tears."
