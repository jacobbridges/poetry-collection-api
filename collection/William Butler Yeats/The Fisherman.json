    "Climbing up to a place",
    "Where stone is dark with froth,",
    "And the down turn of his wrist",
    "When the flies drop in the stream\u2014",
    "A man who does not exist,",
    "A man who is but a dream;",
    "And cried, \u201cBefore I am old",
    "I shall have written him one",
    "Poem maybe as cold",
    "And passionate as the dawn.\u201d"
