    "I",
    "That is no country for old men. The young",
    "In one another's arms, birds in the trees,",
    "\u2014Those dying generations\u2014at their song,",
    "The salmon-falls, the mackerel-crowded seas,",
    "Fish, flesh, or fowl, commend all summer long",
    "Whatever is begotten, born, and dies.",
    "Caught in that sensual music all neglect",
    "Monuments of unageing intellect.",
    "II",
    "An aged man is but a paltry thing,",
    "A tattered coat upon a stick, unless",
    "Soul clap its hands and sing, and louder sing",
    "For every tatter in its mortal dress,",
    "Nor is there singing school but studying",
    "Monuments of its own magnificence;",
    "And therefore I have sailed the seas and come",
    "To the holy city of Byzantium.",
    "III",
    "O sages standing in God's holy fire",
    "As in the gold mosaic of a wall,",
    "Come from the holy fire, perne in a gyre,",
    "And be the singing-masters of my soul.",
    "Consume my heart away; sick with desire",
    "And fastened to a dying animal",
    "It knows not what it is; and gather me",
    "Into the artifice of eternity.",
    "IV",
    "Once out of nature I shall never take",
    "My bodily form from any natural thing,",
    "But such a form as Grecian goldsmiths make",
    "Of hammered gold and gold enamelling",
    "To keep a drowsy Emperor awake;",
    "Or set upon a golden bough to sing",
    "To lords and ladies of Byzantium",
    "Of what is past, or passing, or to come."
