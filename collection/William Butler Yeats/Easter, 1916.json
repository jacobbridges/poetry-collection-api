    "I have met them at close of day",
    "Coming with vivid faces",
    "From counter or desk among grey",
    "Eighteenth-century houses.",
    "I have passed with a nod of the head",
    "Or polite meaningless words,",
    "Or have lingered awhile and said",
    "Polite meaningless words,",
    "And thought before I had done",
    "Of a mocking tale or a gibe",
    "To please a companion",
    "Around the fire at the club,",
    "Being certain that they and I",
    "But lived where motley is worn:",
    "All changed, changed utterly:",
    "A terrible beauty is born.",
    "That woman's days were spent",
    "In ignorant good-will,",
    "Her nights in argument",
    "Until her voice grew shrill.",
    "What voice more sweet than hers",
    "When, young and beautiful,",
    "She rode to harriers?",
    "This man had kept a school",
    "And rode our wing\u00e8d horse;",
    "This other his helper and friend",
    "Was coming into his force;",
    "He might have won fame in the end,",
    "So sensitive his nature seemed,",
    "So daring and sweet his thought.",
    "This other man I had dreamed",
    "A drunken, vainglorious lout.",
    "He had done most bitter wrong",
    "To some who are near my heart,",
    "Yet I number him in the song;",
    "He, too, has resigned his part",
    "In the casual comedy;",
    "He, too, has been changed in his turn,",
    "Transformed utterly:",
    "A terrible beauty is born.",
    "Hearts with one purpose alone",
    "Through summer and winter seem",
    "Enchanted to a stone",
    "To trouble the living stream.",
    "The horse that comes from the road,",
    "The rider, the birds that range",
    "From cloud to tumbling cloud,",
    "Minute by minute they change;",
    "A shadow of cloud on the stream",
    "Changes minute by minute;",
    "A horse-hoof slides on the brim,",
    "And a horse plashes within it;",
    "The long-legged moor-hens dive,",
    "And hens to moor-cocks call;",
    "Minute by minute they live:",
    "The stone's in the midst of all.",
    "Too long a sacrifice",
    "Can make a stone of the heart.",
    "O when may it suffice?",
    "That is Heaven's part, our part",
    "To murmur name upon name,",
    "As a mother names her child",
    "When sleep at last has come",
    "On limbs that had run wild.",
    "What is it but nightfall?",
    "No, no, not night but death;",
    "Was it needless death after all?",
    "For England may keep faith",
    "For all that is done and said.",
    "We know their dream; enough",
    "To know they dreamed and are dead;",
    "And what if excess of love",
    "Bewildered them till they died?",
    "I write it out in a verse\u2014",
    "MacDonagh and MacBride",
    "And Connolly and Pearse",
    "Now and in time to be,",
    "Wherever green is worn,",
    "Are changed, changed utterly:",
    "A terrible beauty is born."
