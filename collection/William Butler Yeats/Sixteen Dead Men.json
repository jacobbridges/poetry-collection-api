    "O but we talked at large before",

    "But who can talk of give and take,",
    "What should be and what not",
    "While those dead men are loitering there",
    "To stir the boiling pot?",
    "You say that we should still the land",
    "Till Germany\u2019s overcome;",
    "But who is there to argue that",
    "Now Pearse is deaf and dumb?",
    "And is their logic to outweigh",
    "MacDonagh\u2019s bony thumb?",
    "How could you dream they\u2019d listen",
    "That have an ear alone",
    "For those new comrades they have found,",
    "Lord Edward and Wolfe Tone,",
    "Or meddle with our give and take",
    "That converse bone to bone?"
