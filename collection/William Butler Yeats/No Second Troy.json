    "Why should I blame her that she filled my days",
    "With misery, or that she would of late",
    "Have taught to ignorant men most violent ways,",
    "Or hurled the little streets upon the great,",
    "Had they but courage equal to desire?",
    "What could have made her peaceful with a mind",
    "That nobleness made simple as a fire,",
    "With beauty like a tightened bow, a kind",
    "That is not natural in an age like this,",

    "Why, what could she have done, being what she is?",
    "Was there another Troy for her to burn?"
