    "These ghost soldiers live underground with the vast",
    "oversupply of castoff lanterns.",
    "If one were to take broadsword to one of these",
    "orange-bearded mammoth men of rough hew,",
    "he would laugh at the passing metal,",
    "make light of entrails.",
    "For years I have been here without a clear map.",
    "That hopes should dim as days go on above is",
    "natural I suppose, what do I know?",
    "I am dressed like one of them.",
    "The thick walls quake but stay soundproof.",
    "I fear my fists vestigial.",
    "These soldiers\u2019 own panic is taking up rugs",
    "finding filigrees of the former world beneath,",
    "e.g., a locket with their mongrel\u2019s mush.",
    "They will freeze, then feign noncom; smacking barrels of burgundy",
    "with pistol butts. I react comme squirrel:",
    "fleeing their reach to the chamber out of the impact area.",
    "One loved me until I asked if he worried about what must be",
    "happening without us. Well, his lips did narrow, hand abandoned my knee,",
    "blah, blah big mouth were his departing words.",
    "I will not say with shame that I came from nothing.",
    "Someone paved my first breakthrough at least,",
    "one time calling it love. And I will stand by that",
    "as it applies to my primary makeup."
