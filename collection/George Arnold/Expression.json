    "A hackneyed burden, to a hackneyed air,\u2014",
    "\u201cI love thee only,\u2014thou art wondrous fair!\u201d",
    "Alas! the poets have worn the theme threadbare!",
    "Can I not find some words less tame and old,",
    "To paint thy form and face of perfect mould,",
    "Thy dewy lips, thy hair of brown and gold?",
    "Can I not sing in somewhat fresher strain",
    "The love I lavish and receive again,\u2014",
    "The thrilling joy, so like to thrilling pain?",
    "Can I not, by some metaphor divine,",
    "Describe the life I quaff like nectared wine",
    "In being thine, and knowing thou art mine?",
    "Ah, no! this halting verse can naught express;",
    "No English words can half the truth confess,",
    "That have not all been rhymed to weariness!",
    "So let me cease my scribbling for to-day,",
    "And maiden, turn thy lovely face this way,\u2014",
    "Words will not do, but haply kisses may!"
