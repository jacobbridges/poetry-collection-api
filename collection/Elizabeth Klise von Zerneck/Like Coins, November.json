    "We drove past late fall fields as flat and cold",
    "as sheets of tin and, in the distance, trees",
    "were tossed like coins against the sky. Stunned gold",
    "and bronze, oaks, maples stood in twos and threes:",
    "some copper bright, a few dull brown and, now",
    "and then, the shock of one so steeled with frost",
    "it glittered like a dime. The autumn boughs",
    "and blackened branches wore a somber gloss",
    "that whispered tails to me, not heads. I read",
    "memorial columns in their trunks; their leaves",
    "spelled UNUM, cent; and yours, the only head . . .",
    "in penny profile, Lincoln-like (one sleeve,",
    "one eye) but even it was turning tails",
    "as russet leaves lay spent across the trails."
