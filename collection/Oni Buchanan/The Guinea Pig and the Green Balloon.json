    "I approached the luminous stranger who came to me",
    "from darkness in a gown of lettuce leaves, in a velvet",
    "cloak of green that appeared at first another piece of dark,",
    "but pulled apart into the glow-sphere that danced",
    "in swaying steps, the lucent majesty that slipped toward me",
    "from the reigning silence black above my cage.",
    "Oh extravagant\u2014and were my teeth too sharp to greet",
    "or sharp enough? I do not understand now what was meant",
    "to happen and what was a mistake\u2014but know the bursting,",
    "the sickening snap of ecstasy wrenched back to the body",
    "and the green gown flung in crippled circles traced",
    "like diagrams of wasting moons above my head\u2014or portals",
    "to another world, I thought, but as I thought, the shriek",
    "dissolved, the body crumpled from the air and landed",
    "on its side beneath the salt lick. All night I tended",
    "the wasted skin and careful, brought it water,",
    "alfalfa, made a bed of cedar chips and tried to gather",
    "molecules of breath that floated from the plant shelf.",
    "When I remembered morning, I began to cry, began to pray",
    "for night to stay until the green took shape again",
    "and if that shape were gone, I prayed for night",
    "to stay, to be held in the same forever-dark",
    "in which I first looked up and saw the gentle body,",
    "and saw the graceful swaying of the stranger coming",
    "as if for me\u2014now I do not know\u2014but then,",
    "as if for me, and all my loneliness gone."
