    "What is this tint that in the shrill cress",
    "Will never cease to trouble us and in the fields",
    "Gives prick and praise for Beauty?",
    "And said birds that feed on berries",
    "Are pervious\u2014and shook the snow from his thighs.",
    "I thought of nothing carefully, but of snow, and the birds.",
    "Then kissed the cup and sipped a little",
    "Though almost choked drank slowly",
    "Tickled with strange measure",
    "She faked a pretty anger",
    "I entertained the night with fantastic, empty pleasure",
    "We went as far as the ivie-bush",
    "And ivie-crowns upon our heads",
    "And carried her kiss untouched and entire",
    "Then all was fresh, inclined",
    "To wriggle and nussle and lascivious",
    "Ardent leaps. In the thickest of the wood",
    "Bid him kiss close and often",
    "And directed him to her fancie",
    "The ground had a sweeter scent, the boughs a blush",
    "One fruit, rare and rich, would outdo many together",
    "She was wild to climb the tree",
    "Nor would she be forbidden",
    "She seized the apple and put it in her bosom."
