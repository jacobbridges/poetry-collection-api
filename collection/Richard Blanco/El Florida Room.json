    "Not a study or a den, but",
    "as my mother called it, a pretty name",
    "for the room with the prettiest view",
    "of the lipstick-red hibiscus puckered up",
    "against the windows, the tepid breeze",
    "laden with the brown-sugar scent",
    "of loquats drifting in from the yard.",
    "Not a sunroom, but where the sun",
    "both rose and set, all day the shadows",
    "of banana trees fan-dancing across",
    "the floor, and if it rained, it rained",
    "the loudest, like marbles plunking",
    "across the roof under constant threat",
    "of coconuts ready to fall from the sky.",
    "Not a sitting room, but",
    ", where",
    "I sat alone for hours with butterflies",
    "frozen on the polyester curtains",
    "and faces of Lladr\u00f3 figurines: sad angels,",
    "clowns, and princesses with eyes glazed",
    "blue and gray, gazing from behind",
    "the glass doors of the wall cabinet.",
    "Not a TV room, but where I watched",
    "as a boy, clinging",
    "to my brother, safe from vampires",
    "in the same sofa where I fell in love",
    "with Clint Eastwood and my Abuelo",
    "watching westerns, or pitying women",
    "crying in telenovelas with my Abuela.",
    "Not a family room, but the room where",
    "my father twirled his hair while listening",
    "to eight-tracks of Elvis, read Nietzsche",
    "and Kant a few months before he died,",
    "where my mother learned to dance alone",
    "as she swept, and I learned",
    "pressed",
    "against my T\u00eda Julia\u2019s enormous breasts.",
    "At the edge of the city, in the company",
    "of crickets, beside the empty clothesline,",
    "telephone wires, and the moon, tonight",
    "my life is an old friend sitting with me",
    "not in the living room, but in the light",
    "of",
    ", as quiet and necessary",
    "as any star shining above it."
