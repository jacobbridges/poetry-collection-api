    "Over the growing shadows fell the dead weight of light.",
    "With a long bark mules metered the distance and turned back.",
    "Dust rose like columns of unpaid debt.",
    "Spit dried before it could reach the ground.",
    "Then the thin-barked orange trees disowned their thick-skinned fruit.",
    "Then mosquitoes spat out bad blood into the gutters and were gone.",
    "Fish was opened like a two-page book,",
    "its skeleton, caught aflame like an asp,",
    "inscribed with fire along the bone lines,",
    "then slapped on a stone face of a plate",
    "next to a Coca-Cola bottle as cold as hell.",
    "In the market fruit prices jumped up so high \u2014",
    "the seller women turned into hawks.",
    "With a gibbous peacock brushing by their feet,",
    "in the woods where each leaf hides a face,",
    "and each trunk a spine,",
    "and each tree a crime,",
    "where owls and angels,",
    "a man and three women were contesting an apple.",
    "The winner\u2019s body itself was an apple with skin chewed off.",
    "Inside her breasts milk circled like a growling animal",
    "locked behind two heavy nipples.",
    "It was both day and night.",
    "Her moon-white hand on the sun-gold fruit.",
    "In her hair more stones than in a graveyard.",
    "So",
    "I followed the woman as she ate",
    "hoping if not for a bite",
    "then at least",
    "a spit in my direction.",
    "But she left nothing of that apple.",
    "Not even the memory of eating it",
    "ever."
