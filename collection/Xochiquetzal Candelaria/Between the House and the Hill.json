    "This boy lying face down",
    "in my sleep pushes around jars of jelly,",
    "waking me the night he is found",
    "so I can drag him from the wet ground",
    "and clean his blackened belly,",
    "this boy lying face down",
    "who is somehow bound",
    "to me, this hunted herdsman, refugee",
    "waking me the night he is found.",
    "Am I to dress him in an open gown,",
    "bless the holes in his chest with tea",
    "leaves? This boy lying face down,",
    "permeating even the simplest sound,",
    "with the crack in the door he slowly",
    "cries, waking me the night he is found,",
    "lips parted to my blue-black ground,",
    "whispering red vetch inside me,",
    "this slender boy lying down,",
    "waking me the night he is found."
