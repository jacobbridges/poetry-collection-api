    "It seems I get by on more luck than sense,",
    "not the kind brought on by knuckle to wood,",
    "breath on dice, or pennies found in the mud.",
    "I shimmy and slip by on pure fool chance.",
    "At turns charmed and cursed, a girl knows romance",
    "as coffee, red wine, and books; solitude",
    "she counts as daylight virtue and muted",
    "evenings, the inventory of absence.",
    "But this is no sorry spinster story,",
    "just the way days string together a life.",
    "Sometimes I eat soup right out of the pan.",
    "Sometimes I don\u2019t care if I will marry.",
    "I dance in my kitchen on Friday nights,",
    "singing like only a lucky girl can."
