    "As he looked up from his glass, its quickly melting ice,",
    "into the bisected glowing demonic eyes of the goat,",
    "he sensed that something fundamental had shifted,",
    "or was done. As if, after a life of enchantment, he",
    "had awakened, like Bottom, wearing the ears of an ass,",
    "and the only light was a lanthorn, an ersatz moon.",
    "It was not that the calendar hadn\u2019t numbered the days",
    "with an orbital accuracy, its calculations",
    "exact, but like a man who wants to hang a hammock",
    "in his yard, to let its bright net cradle him, but only",
    "has one tree, so he",
    "wild and aware of it",
    "knew",
    "he had lost the order he required, and with it, rest",
    "his thoughts only a sagging bundle of loose ends,",
    "and the heart, a naked animal in search of a pelt,",
    "that once fell for every Large Meaning it could",
    "wrap itself in, as organs are packed in ice for transit",
    "from one ending to the next, an afterlife of parts",
    "and",
    "the whole? Exorbitant claim",
    "not less than all,",
    "and oddly spelled; its ear rhyme is its opposite,",
    "the great hole in the heart of things. The goat,",
    "he noticed, had a rank smell, feral. Unnerved,",
    "he looks away, watches the last of his ice",
    "as it melts, the way some godlike eye might see",
    "the mighty glaciers in a slow dissolve back into sea.",
    "He notes how incommensurate the simile, a last",
    "attempt to dignify his shaking gaze, and reaches",
    "for the bill; he\u2019s damned if the goat will pay."
