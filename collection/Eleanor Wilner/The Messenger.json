    "The messenger runs, not carrying the news",
    "of victory, or defeat; the messenger, unresting,",
    "has always been running, the wind before and behind him,",
    "across the turning back of earth, leaving",
    "his tracks across the plains, his ropes",
    "hanging from the ledges of mountains;",
    "for centuries, millennia, he has been running",
    "carrying whatever it is that cannot be",
    "put down: it is rolled in a tube",
    "made of hide, carefully, to keep it dry",
    "as he runs, through storms and monsoons,",
    "sometimes on foot, sometimes poling a boat",
    "through a flooded mangrove swamp, or",
    "setting stiff sails to cross from island to island",
    "running before the wind. In some ages, peasants",
    "have helped him\u2014bringing him small cakes",
    "of rice wrapped in the weeds of the sea and",
    "new sandals woven of hemp for his torn",
    "bleeding feet; sometimes in the heat of noon",
    "they would offer a drink of rosewater, sometimes",
    "a coat of fur against the winter snows;",
    "and sometimes at night, he would rest",
    "by a fire where voices wove with the music",
    "of gut-strings, or with mountain pipes whose",
    "sound was like wind through the bones",
    "of creation\u2014and he would be cheered",
    "by the company of others, the firelit glow",
    "of their faces like a bright raft afloat in the dark;",
    "at times, rumors spread of his death, scholars",
    "analyzed his obsession, dated his bones, his prayer bundle;",
    "but at dawn, he always arose, in the mists,",
    "in the blur of so many mornings, so many shoes",
    "worn into scraps and discarded, so many",
    "the cities that burned as he passed",
    "them, so many the skulls abandoned",
    "by armies, so many whose blood",
    "stained the threads of their prayer rugs,",
    "so many, so many, so many\u2014",
    "oh,",
    "and that green, sunlit hill that kept",
    "rising from the dark waters of flood, outlined bright",
    "against the sky, the odds, the evidence\u2014",
    "and he, the messenger,",
    "running through history, carries this small tube,",
    "its durable hide\u2014carries it, not like",
    "a torch, no, nothing so blazing;",
    "not like the brass lamp that summons",
    "a genie, no magic wishes;",
    "not like the candles that hope sets aflame",
    "and a breath can extinguish ...",
    "no.",
    "He carried it like",
    "what has no likeness,",
    "what is curled up inside and",
    "he swore he could feel it, though",
    "perhaps he had dreamed it, still",
    "at times, stopping under some tree",
    "or other, when the night was warm,",
    "so close the stars seemed to breathe in",
    "the branches, he would lie quiet,",
    "then it would seem",
    "that whatever it was in there",
    "would pulse softly with light, a code",
    "only the heart could break",
    "(but of course he couldn\u2019t say",
    "for he was only the messenger)\u2014",
    "and at sunrise, wearily, he would rise",
    "to his feet and trudge on, sometimes",
    "running, sometimes stumbling,",
    "carrying whatever it was that could not",
    "be put down, would not be cast aside\u2014",
    "and besides, he would chide himself,",
    "weren\u2019t they all as tired as he,",
    "and hadn\u2019t they helped him, time",
    "and again, on his way?"
