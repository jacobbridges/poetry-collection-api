    "The cave looked much like any other",
    "from a little distance but",
    "as we approached, came almost",
    "to its mouth, we saw its walls within",
    "that slanted up into a dome",
    "were beating like a wild black lung\u2014",
    "it was plastered and hung with",
    "the pulsing bodies of bats, the organ",
    "music of the body\u2019s deep",
    "interior, alive, the sacred cave",
    "with its ten thousand gleaming eyes",
    "near the clustered rocks",
    "where the sea beat with the leather",
    "wings of its own dark waves.",
    "Below the bat-hung, throbbing walls,",
    "an altar stood, glittering with guano,",
    "a stucco sculpture like a Gaudi",
    "church, berserk",
    "Baroque, stone translated into",
    "flux\u2014murk and mud and the floral",
    "extravagance of wet sand dripped",
    "from a giant hand, giving back",
    "blessing, excrement\u2014return",
    "for the first fruits offered to the gods.",
    "We stayed outside, superior",
    "with fear, like tourists",
    "peering through a door, whose hanging",
    "beads rattle in the air from",
    "one who disappeared into the dim",
    "interior; we thought of the caves",
    "of Marabar, of a writer who entered",
    "and never quite emerged\u2014",
    "the caves\u2019 echoing black",
    "emptiness a tunnel in the English",
    "soul where he is wandering still. So",
    "the bat cave on the Bali coast, not far",
    "from Denpasar, holds us off, and beckons ...",
    "Standing there now, at the mouth",
    "of the cave\u2014this time we enter, feel",
    "inside the flutter of those",
    "many hearts, the radiant heat of pumping",
    "veins, the stretch of wing on bone",
    "like a benediction, and the familiar",
    "faces of this many-headed god,",
    "benevolent as night is",
    "to the weary\u2014the way at dark",
    "the cave releases them all,",
    "how they must lift like the foam",
    "on a wave breaking, how many",
    "they are as they enter",
    "the starlit air, and scatter",
    "in wild wide arcs",
    "in search of fruit, the sweet bites",
    "of mosquito ...",
    "while the great domes of our",
    "own kind slide open, the eye",
    "that watches, tracks the skies,",
    "and the huge doors roll slowly back",
    "on the hangars, the planes",
    "push out their noses of steel,",
    "their wings a bright alloy",
    "of aluminum and death, they roar",
    "down the runways, tear into",
    "the night, their heavy bodies fueled",
    "from sucking at the hidden",
    "veins of earth; they leave a trail of fire",
    "behind them as they scar",
    "the air, filling the dreams",
    "of children, sleeping\u2014anywhere,",
    "Chicago, Baghdad\u2014with blood,",
    "as the bombs drop, as the world",
    "splits open, as the mothers",
    "reach for their own",
    "in the night of the falling",
    "sky, madness in",
    "method, nature gone",
    "into reverse ...",
    "here, nearly unperturbed,",
    "the bats from the sacred cave",
    "fill the night with their calls,",
    "high-pitched, tuned to the solid world",
    "as eyes to the spectrum of light, gnats",
    "to the glow of a lamp\u2014the bats",
    "circle, the clouds wheel,",
    "the earth turns",
    "pulling the dome of stars",
    "among the spinning trees, blurring",
    "the sweet globes of fruit, shaped",
    "exactly to desire\u2014dizzy, we swing",
    "back to the cave on our stiff dark",
    "wings, the sweet juice of papaya",
    "drying on our jaws, home",
    "to the cave, to attach ourselves",
    "back to the pulsing dome, until,",
    "hanging there, sated and sleepy,",
    "we can see what was once our world",
    "upside down as it is",
    "and wonder whose altars",
    "those are, white,",
    "encrusted with shit."
