    "If the nose of the pig in the market of Firenze",
    "has lost its matte patina, and shines, brassy,",
    "even in the half light; if the mosaic saint",
    "on the tiles of the Basilica floor is half gone,",
    "worn by the gravity of solid soles, the passing",
    "of piety; if the arms of Venus have reentered",
    "the rubble, taken by time, her perennial lover,",
    "mutilating even the memory of beauty;",
    "and if",
    "the mother, hiding with her child from",
    "the death squads of brutality,",
    "if she, trying to keep the child",
    "quiet, to keep them from being found out,",
    "holds her hand over his mouth, holds him",
    "against her, tighter and tighter, until he stops",
    "breathing;",
    "if the restorer\u2014trying to bring back",
    "to perfection the masterpiece scarred by its",
    "transit through time, wipes away",
    "by mistake, the mysterious smile. . .",
    "if what",
    "loves, and love is, takes away what it aims",
    "to preserve,",
    "then here is the place to fall",
    "silent, meaning well but in danger",
    "of marring what we would praise, unable",
    "to do more than wear down the marble",
    "steps to the altar, smother the fire",
    "we would keep from the wind\u2019s extinction,",
    "or if, afraid",
    "of our fear, we lift the lid from the embers, and send",
    "abroad, into the parched night, a flight of sparks,",
    "incendiary, dying to catch somewhere,",
    "hungry for fuel, the past, its dry provision",
    "tinder for brilliance and heat, prelude",
    "to cold, and to ash. . ."
