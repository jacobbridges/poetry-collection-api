    "Nights, by the light of whatever would burn:",
    "tallow, tinder and the silken rope",
    "of wick that burns slow, slow",
    "we wove the baskets from the long gold strands",
    "of wheat that were another silk: worm soul",
    "spun the one, yellow seed in the dark soil, the other.",
    "The fields lay fallow, swollen with frost,",
    "expectant winter. Mud clung to the edges",
    "of our gowns; we had hung back like shadows",
    "on the walls of trees and watched. In the little circles",
    "that our tapers threw, murdered men rose red",
    "in their clanging armor, muttered",
    "words that bled through the bars",
    "of iron masks:",
    "who sold us to the glory fields, lied.",
    "Trumpets without tongues, we wove lilies",
    "into the baskets. When they asked us",
    "what we meant by these, we\u2019d say \u201cmary, mary\u201d",
    "and be still. We lined the baskets on the sill",
    "in the barn, where it is always dusk",
    "and the cows smell sweet. Now the snow",
    "sifts through the trees, dismembered",
    "lace, the white dust of angels, angels.",
    "And the ringing of keys that hang",
    "in bunches at our waists, and the sound of silk",
    "whispering, whispering.",
    "There is nothing in the high windows",
    "but swirling snow,",
    "the glittering milk of winter.",
    "The halls grow chill. The candles flicker.",
    "Let them wait who will and think what they want.",
    "The lord has gone with the hunt, and the snow,",
    "the snow grows thicker. Well he will keep",
    "till spring thaw comes. Head, hand, and heart\u2014",
    "baskets of wicker, baskets of straw."
