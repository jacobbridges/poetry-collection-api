    "By the stream, where the ground is soft",
    "and gives, under the slightest pressure\u2014even",
    "the fly would leave its footprint here",
    "and the paw of the shrew the crescent",
    "of its claws like the strokes of a chisel",
    "in clay; where the lightest chill, lighter",
    "than the least rumor of winter, sets the reeds",
    "to a kind of speaking, and a single drop of rain",
    "leaves a crater to catch the first silver",
    "glint of sun when the clouds slide away",
    "from each other like two tired lovers,",
    "and the light returns, pale, though brightened",
    "by the last chapter of late autumn:",
    "copper, rusted oak, gold aspen, and the red",
    "pages of maple, the wind leafing through to the end",
    "the annals of beech, the slim volumes",
    "of birch, the elegant script of the ferns ...",
    "for the birds, it is all",
    "notations for a coda, for the otter",
    "an invitation to the river,",
    "and for the deer\u2014a dream",
    "in which to disappear, light-footed",
    "on the still open book of earth,",
    "adding the marks of their passage,",
    "adding it all in, waiting only",
    "for the first thick flurry of snowflakes",
    "for cover, soft cover that carries",
    "no title, no name."
