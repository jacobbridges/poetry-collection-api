    "Grampa, monster of malevolence,",
    "I\u2019m told was actually a rare old-fashioned gentleman of courtly benevolence.",
    "At night the thing to do was drive to Pevely Dairy",
    "And park and watch the fountain shooting up and changing colors.",
    "The child sat in the back, finishing his ice-cream soda,",
    "Sucking the straw in the empty glass as a noisy coda.",

    "It was fun. It was fine.",
    "The smell of rain about to fall,",
    "A sudden coolness in the air,",
    "Sweetness wider than the Mississippi at its muddy brownest.",

    "...brought to you by",
    "!",
    "I travel backwards in a time machine",
    "And step inside a boy who\u2019s three feet tall.",
    "How dare he have such curly hair!",

    "I thought I had gone to heaven and died."
