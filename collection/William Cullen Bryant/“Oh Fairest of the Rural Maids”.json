    "Oh fairest of the rural maids!",
    "Thy birth was in the forest shades;",
    "Green boughs, and glimpses of the sky,",
    "Were all that met thine infant eye.",
    "Thy sports, thy wanderings, when a child,",
    "Were even in the sylvan wild;",
    "And all the beauty of the place",
    "Is in thy heart and on thy face.",
    "The twilight of the trees and rocks",
    "Is in the light shade of thy locks;",
    "Thy step is as the wind, that weaves",
    "Its playful way among the leaves.",
    "Thine eyes are springs, in whose serene",
    "And silent waters heaven is seen;",
    "Their lashes are the herbs that look",
    "On their young figures in the brook.",
    "The forest depths, by foot unpressed,",
    "Are not more sinless than thy breast;",
    "The holy peace, that fills the air",
    "Of those calm solitudes, is there."
