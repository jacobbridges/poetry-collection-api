    "But what lovers we were, what lovers,",
    "even when it was all over\u2014",
    "the bull-black, deadweight wines that we swung",
    "towards each other rang and rang",
    "like bells of blood, our own great hearts.",
    "We slung the drunk boat out of port",
    "and watched our sober unreal life",
    "unmoor, a continent of grief;",
    "the candlelight strange on our faces",
    "like the tiny silent blazes",
    "and coruscations of its wars.",
    "We blew them out and took the stairs",
    "into the night for the night's work,",
    "stripped off in the timbered dark,",
    "gently hooked each other on",
    "like aqualungs, and thundered down",
    "to mine our lovely secret wreck.",
    "We surfaced later, breathless, back",
    "to back, and made our way alone",
    "up the mined beach of the dawn."
