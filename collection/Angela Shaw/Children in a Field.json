    "They don\u2019t wade in so much as they are taken.",
    "Deep in the day, in the deep of the field,",
    "every current in the grasses whispers",
    ", every yellow spreads its perfume",
    "like a rumor, impelling them further on.",
    "It is the way of girls. It is the sway",
    "of their dresses in the summer trance-",
    "light, their bare calves already far-gone",
    "in green. What songs will they follow?",
    "Whatever the wood warbles, whatever storm",
    "or harm the border promises, whatever",
    "calm. Let them go. Let them go traceless",
    "through the high grass and into the willow-",
    "blur, traceless across the lean blue glint",
    "of the river, to the long dark bodies",
    "of the conifers, and over the welcoming",
    "threshold of nightfall."
