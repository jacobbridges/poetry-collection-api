    "Therefore the man with heavy eyes",
    "Declines the gambit, shows fatigue,",
    "Leaves the room and reappears",
    "Outside the window, leaning in,",
    "Branches of wistaria",
    "Circumscribe a golden grin;",
    "The host with someone indistinct",
    "Converses at the door apart,",
    "The nightingales are singing near",
    "The Convent of the Sacred Heart,",
    "And sang within the bloody wood",
    "When Agamemnon cried aloud",
    "And let their liquid siftings fall",
    "To stain the stiff dishonoured shroud.",
