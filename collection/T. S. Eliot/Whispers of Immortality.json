    "Webster was much possessed by death",
    "And saw the skull beneath the skin;",
    "And breastless creatures under ground",
    "Leaned backward with a lipless grin.",
    "Daffodil bulbs instead of balls",
    "Stared from the sockets of the eyes!",
    "He knew that thought clings round dead limbs",
    "Tightening its lusts and luxuries.",
    "Donne, I suppose, was such another",
    "Who found no substitute for sense,",
    "To seize and clutch and penetrate;",
    "Expert beyond experience,",
    "He knew the anguish of the marrow",
    "The ague of the skeleton;",
    "No contact possible to flesh",
    "Allayed the fever of the bone.",
    "Grishkin is nice: her Russian eye",
    "Is underlined for emphasis;",
    "Uncorseted, her friendly bust",
    "Gives promise of pneumatic bliss.",
    "The couched Brazilian jaguar",
    "Compels the scampering marmoset",
    "With subtle effluence of cat;",
    "Grishkin has a maisonnette;",
    "The sleek Brazilian jaguar",
    "Does not in its arboreal gloom",
    "Distil so rank a feline smell",
    "As Grishkin in a drawing-room.",
    "And even the Abstract Entities",
    "Circumambulate her charm;",
    "But our lot crawls between dry ribs",
    "To keep our metaphysics warm.",
