    "The merest suggestion of mouth",
    "and I was ravenous\u2014I filled the house",
    "with chocolate, chestnuts, strudel,",
    "blood sausage; I bathed in butter.",
    "A glimpse of tongue and I was undone,",
    "simply a hint of heavy cream",
    "and the wax came off in a greasy slab,",
    "there were no cauldrons large enough.",
    "I imagined his body drawn in sections,",
    "flank, ribs, and tenderloin, I rubbed",
    "the blade to sparks, my stove walls",
    "sweated, windows dripping.",
    "Afterwards the house was a shell.",
    "My tongue: scorched white.",
    "I had to staple my stomach",
    "down to the size of a lichee nut.",
    "Thimbleful of broth, thimbleful",
    "of gruel, the merest suggestion",
    "floods my mouth with memory",
    "so rich I practically drown."
