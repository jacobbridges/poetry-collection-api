    "This was my gig: white lace apron,",
    "cut-out bra and crop. I crouched above him",
    "every Thursday in the marble bathroom,",
    "pissed on his bare chest as let him lick me dry.",
    "He wasn\u2019t the first to love the thought",
    "of the redness of a bottom, mark of a heel.",
    "So when my ex dropped three tabs of sunshine",
    "and decided I\u2019d screwed his best friend,",
    "I thought I knew what to expect. Hadn\u2019t",
    "the drag queen across the street, pistol-whipped,",
    "sat silent on her folded raincoat?",
    "anyone can do she said, and the bistro patrons",
    "hailed their cabs and stepped over her.",
    "And when he held me dangling over West End,",
    "window wide onto the avenue, I know the woman",
    "outside the building with her collar open, back to God,",
    "heard me get it as I prayed for one less smack against the sill."
