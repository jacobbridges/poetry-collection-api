    "At dawn wind out of the north, hailflecks, pebbly",
    "skates against windows. I lie thinking",
    "the drainspout\u2019s drip comes",
    "again in the basement",
    "faucet where I am crying,",
    "a child betrayed by death\u2019s",
    "new cardinal and the cat",
    "yawning on the porch",
    "where my grandmother found me.",
    "Risen now, I see the river full-bodied, its white",
    "wind-knotted hair swirling like hers.",
    "The polar hickory is naked",
    "as a saber recalled by a girl",
    "long gone in the gold",
    "sauce of apples.",
    "Two leaves that might be",
    "cardinals returned",
    "tumble in the hard light",
    "at the brick fence.",
    "Nothing moves in boxwood",
    "where gray soldiers lie.",
    "Among the last of them she walked, cupping apples,",
    "staining her white frock, who took",
    "a boy far back into the haze",
    "the Shenandoah hills held",
    "where family stallions",
    "might walk aimless ground",
    "littered with purpling flesh",
    "beyond the cull of seasons.",
    "Through a gate nailed",
    "with leather belts",
    "in my mind, I pass and enter",
    "the arthritic orchard",
    "tended by widows. What",
    "I gather wakes me to think",
    "how bright on the tongue was the taste kept",
    "concealed, sustained, of flesh",
    "abiding, months beneath",
    "the wintering house floors.",
    "To reach this I must go",
    "down storm-worn stones",
    "and pick my steps past",
    "the sealed boxes of family",
    "debris, nightgowns, flannels,",
    "ribbons, birthspoons, a pair",
    "of dulled skates, flowers",
    "pressed in a moldy Bible.",
    "Why is it we keep what we cannot bear",
    "to use, and can\u2019t escape, shoving",
    "ourselves into shrunken rooms",
    "edged with old foolishness",
    "unforgiven and unforgotten?",
    "I fumble to the center",
    "and pull a yellow light",
    "down the ancient string",
    "still dependably there",
    "and stand, in my head,",
    "as she did, playfully",
    "asking where they went.",
    "I know, I know, I say",
    "back there in the dust",
    "where I\u2019ve come again",
    "to look through tiny windows",
    "into skirts of boxwood, a morning",
    "that sends me alive among gray soldiers",
    "at the house roots. I see also blue",
    "preserving jars full of slick",
    "pulpy flesh she has put up",
    "in a juice thick as blood.",
    "Behind it all in dark eaves,",
    "baskets of apples, split",
    "pine boxes like generations",
    "steeping, undisturbed",
    "by the tick and groan",
    "of housepipes veining",
    "the overhead I leave. Oh",
    "let me see her light bring",
    "back those stallion-feeders,",
    "little red handfuls of joy! Look",
    "how long I\u2019ve slept, learning to walk",
    "straight into a dawn-silvered web",
    "where secret spiders spin",
    "ceaseless as the seasons.",
    "Above me ice takes each",
    "room, I can hear feet",
    "pacing fretful halls,",
    "yet here I lift my face",
    "and puff back all the silk",
    "in the world. I hold every",
    "core peeled on this slab.",
    "My fingers claw the meat",
    "of family stillness,",
    "parting all the way to seeds.",
    "Oh widows of the air,",
    "fill me with your",
    "cidery, useless lying,",
    "those bladed hours",
    "you fed me the dark",
    "rotting dreams of your love."
