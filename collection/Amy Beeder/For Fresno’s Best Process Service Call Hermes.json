    "True, my office is a gold Camino nineteen eighty-two",
    "& front-work\u2019s on a laptop, but there are older tricks:",
    "this knack I have to spy a sham address: figures",
    "pried off siding or the silhouette that\u2019s left",
    "when eight is changed to three; my talent to discern",
    "the perp who hides behind the car or ducks among",
    "the bins or sidles, slams the screen & tries",
    "for silence then behind his gutted door. Some",
    "will wave a gun or summon dogs. Once a rooster.",
    "Once an alderman who menaced with a mallet",
    "(croquet) when his trucking company was sued",
    "& there\u2019s still this lucent bruise on my right heel",
    "\u2014",
    "long story: swan shot, tree house, veteran. Though",
    "no one wants this dachshund\u2019s weight of paper",
    "compiled by some paralegal underpaid in Phoenix,",
    "I assure you I will always serve. I am the envoy",
    "(a ball cap hides my third eye). Put me in swift shoes",
    "or wings, at some cosmic door with only sky behind",
    "\u2014",
    "black-clad, the Prophet of Xerox, steadfast",
    "bearer of a clerk court\u2019s smeared truncated seal.",
    "I know these streets: the houses boarded up,",
    "the other heralds driving slow on fractured blacktop;",
    "the sidewalks\u2019 glass & fenders scattered; vacant quarter",
    "acres returning now to palm & pampas, trees of heaven.",
    "I am waiting at the crossroads, here at your broken gate",
    "where barbed acacias stoop to shade my trespass."
