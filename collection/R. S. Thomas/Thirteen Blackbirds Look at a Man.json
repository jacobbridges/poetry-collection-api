    "It is calm.",
    "It is as though",
    "we lived in a garden",
    "that had not yet arrived",
    "at the knowledge of",
    "good and evil.",
    "But there is a man in it.",

    "There will be",
    "rain falling vertically",
    "from an indifferent",
    "sky. There will stare out",
    "from behind its",
    "bars the face of the man",
    "who is not enjoying it.",
    "3",
    "Nothing higher",
    "than a blackberry",
    "bush. As the sun comes up",
    "fresh, what is the darkness",
    "stretching from horizon",
    "to horizon? It is the shadow",
    "here of the forked man.",
    "4",
    "We have eaten",
    "the blackberries and spat out",
    "the seeds, but they lie",
    "glittering like the eyes of a man.",
    "5",
    "After we have stopped",
    "singing, the garden is disturbed",
    "by echoes; it is",
    "the man whistling, expecting",
    "everything to come to him.",
    "6",
    "We wipe our beaks",
    "on the branches",
    "wasting the dawn\u2019s",
    "jewellery to get rid",
    "of the taste of a man.",
    "7",
    "Neverthless,",
    "which is not the case",
    "with a man, our",
    "bills give us no trouble.",

    "9",
    "In the cool",
    "of the day the garden",

    "to blackbirds. Yet",
    "we know also that somewhere",
    "there is a man in hiding.",
    "10",
    "To us there are",
    "eggs and there are",
    "blackbirds. But there is the man,",
    "too, trying without feathers",
    "to incubate a solution.",
    "11",
    "We spread our",
    "wings, reticulating",
    "our air-space. A man stands",
    "under us and worries",
    "at his ability to do the same.",

    "When night comes",
    "like a visitor",
    "from outer space",
    "we stop our ears",
    "lest we should hear tell",
    "of the man in the moon.",
    "13",
    "Summer is",
    "at an end. The migrants",
    "depart. When they return",
    "in spring to the garden,",
    "will there be a man among them?"
