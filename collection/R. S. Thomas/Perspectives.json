    "Beasts rearing from green slime\u2014",
    "an illiterate country, unable to read",
    "its own name. Stones moved into position",
    "on the hills\u2019 sides; snakes laid their eggs",
    "in their cold shadow. The earth suffered",
    "the sky\u2019s shrapnel, bled yellow",
    "into the enraged sea. At night heavily",
    "over the heaving forests the moon",
    "sagged. The ancestors of the tigers",
    "brightened their claws. Such sounds",
    "as there were came from the strong",
    "torn by the stronger. The dawn tilted",
    "an unpolished mirror for the runt mind",
    "to look at itself in without recognition.",
    "I shall not be here,",
    "and the way things are going",
    "now won\u2019t want to be.",
    "Wheels go no faster",
    "than what pulls them. That land",
    "visible over the sea",
    "in clear weather, they say",
    "we will get there some time",
    "soon and take possession",
    "of it. What then? More acres",
    "to cultivate and no markets",
    "for the crops.",
    "The young",
    "are not what they were,",
    "smirking at the auspices",
    "of the entrails. Some think",
    "there will be a revival.",
    "I don\u2019t believe it. This",
    "plucked music has come",
    "to stay. The natural breathing",
    "of the pipes was to",
    "a different god. Imagine",
    "depending on the intestines",
    "of a polecat for accompaniment",
    "to one\u2019s worship! I have",
    "attended at the sacrifice",
    "of the language that is the liturgy",
    "the priests like, and felt",
    "the draught that was God",
    "leaving. I think some day",
    "there will be nothing left",
    "but to go back to the place",
    "I came from and wrap",
    "myself in the memory",
    "of how I was young",
    "once and under the covenant",
    "of that God not given to folly.",
    "They were bearded",
    "like the sea they came",
    "from; rang stone bells",
    "for their stone hearers.",
    "Their cells fitted them",
    "like a coffin.",
    "Out of them their prayers",
    "seeped, delicate",
    "flowers where weeds",
    "grew. Their dry bread",
    "broke like a bone.",
    "Wine in the cup",
    "was a blood-stained mirror",
    "for sinners to look",
    "into with one eye",
    "closed, and see themselves forgiven.",
    "I was my lord\u2019s bard,",
    "telling again sweetly",
    "what had been done bloodily.",
    "We lived in a valley;",
    "he had no lady.",
    "Fame was our horizon.",
    "In the spring of the year",
    "the wind brought the news",
    "of a woman\u2019s beauty.",
    "Her eyes were still stones",
    "in her smooth-running hair.",
    "Her voice was the birds\u2019 envy.",
    "We made a brave foray;",
    "the engagement was furious.",
    "We came back alone.",
    "Sing me, my lord said,",
    "the things nearer home:",
    "my falcons, my horse.",
    "I did so, he listened.",
    "My harp was of fire;",
    "the notes bounced like sparks",
    "off his spirit\u2019s anvil.",
    "To-morrow, he promised,",
    "we will ride forth again.",
    "And the brittle gardens",
    "of Dinorwig, deep",
    "in the fallen petals of",
    "their slate flowers: such the autumn",
    "of a people! Whose spring",
    "is it sleeps in a glass",
    "bulb, ready to astonish us",
    "with its brilliance? Bring",
    "on the dancing girls",
    "of the future, the swaying",
    "pylons with their metal",
    "hair bickering towards England."
