    "I want you to know how it was,",
    "whether the Cross grinds into dust",
    "under men\u2019s wheels or shines brightly",
    "as a monument to a new era.",
    "There was a church and one man",
    "served it, and few worshipped",
    "there in the raw light on the hill",
    "in winter, moving among the stones",
    "fallen about them like the ruins",
    "of a culture they were too weak",
    "to replace, too poor themselves",
    "to do anything but wait",
    "for the ending of a life",
    "they had not asked for.",
    "The priest would come",
    "and pull on the hoarse bell nobody",
    "heard, and enter that place",
    "of darkness, sour with the mould",
    "of the years. And the spider would run",
    "from the chalice, and the wine lie",
    "there for a time, cold and unwanted",
    "by all but he, while the candles",
    "guttered as the wind picked",
    "at the roof. And he would see",
    "over that bare meal his face",
    "staring at him from the cracked glass",
    "of the window, with the lips moving",
    "like those of an inhabitant of",
    "a world beyond this.",
    "And so back",
    "to the damp vestry to the book",
    "where he would scratch his name and the date",
    "he could hardly remember, Sunday",
    "by Sunday, while the place sank",
    "to its knees and the earth turned",
    "from season to season like the wheel",
    "of a great foundry to produce",
    "you, friend, who will know what happened."
