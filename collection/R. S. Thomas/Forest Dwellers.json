    "Men who have hardly uncurled",
    "from their posture in the",
    "womb. Naked. Heads bowed, not",
    "in prayer, but in contemplation",
    "of the earth they came from,",
    "that suckled them on the brown",
    "milk that builds bone not brain.",
    "Who called them forth to walk",
    "in the green light, their thoughts",
    "on darkness? Their women,",
    "who are not Madonnas, have babes",
    "at the breast with the wise,",
    "time-ridden faces of the Christ",
    "child in a painting by a Florentine",
    "master. The warriors prepare poison",
    "with love\u2019s care for the Sebastians",
    "of their arrows. They have no",
    "God, but follow the contradictions",
    "of a ritual that says",
    "life must die that life",
    "may go on. They wear flowers in their hair."
