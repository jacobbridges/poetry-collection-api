    "My garden is the wild",
    "Sea of the grass. Her garden",
    "Shelters between walls.",
    "The tide could break in;",
    "I should be sorry for this.",
    "There is peace there of a kind,",
    "Though not the deep peace",
    "Of wild places. Her care",
    "For green life has enabled",
    "The weak things to grow.",
    "Despite my first love,",
    "I take sometimes her hand,",
    "Following straight paths",
    "Between flowers, the nostril",
    "Clogged with their thick scent.",
    "The old softness of lawns",
    "Persuading the slow foot",
    "Leads to defection; the silence",
    "Holds with its gloved hand",
    "The wild hawk of the mind.",
    "But not for long, windows,",
    "Opening in the trees",
    "Call the mind back",
    "To its true eyrie; I stoop",
    "Here only in play."
