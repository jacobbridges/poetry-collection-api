    "Evans? Yes, many a time",
    "I came down his bare flight",
    "Of stairs into the gaunt kitchen",
    "With its wood fire, where crickets sang",
    "Accompaniment to the black kettle\u2019s",
    "Whine, and so into the cold",
    "Dark to smother in the thick tide",
    "Of night that drifted about the walls",
    "Of his stark farm on the hill ridge.",
    "It was not the dark filling my eyes",
    "And mouth apalled me; not even the drip",
    "Of rain like blood from the one tree",
    "Weather-tortured. It was the dark",
    "Silting the veins of that sick man",
    "I left stranded upon the vast",
    "And lonely shore of his bleak bed."
