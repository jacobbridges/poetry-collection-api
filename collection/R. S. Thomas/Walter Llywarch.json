    "I am, as you know, Walter Llywarch,",
    "Born in Wales of approved parents,",
    "Well goitred, round in the bum,",
    "Sure prey of the slow virus",
    "Bred in quarries of grey rain.",
    "Born in autumn at the right time",
    "For hearing stories from the cracked lips",
    "Of old folk dreaming of summer,",
    "I piled them on to the bare hearth",
    "Of my own fancy to make a blaze",
    "To warm myself, but achieved only",
    "The smoke\u2019s acid that brings the smart",
    "Of false tears into the eyes.",
    "Months of fog, months of drizzle;",
    "Thought wrapped in the grey cocoon",
    "Of race, of place, awaiting the sun\u2019s",
    "Coming, but when the sun came,",
    "Touching the hills with a hot hand,",
    "Wings were spread only to fly",
    "Round and round in a cramped cage",
    "Or beat in vain at the sky\u2019s window.",
    "School in the week, on Sunday chapel:",
    "Tales of a land fairer than this",
    "Were not so tall, for others had proved it",
    "Without the grave\u2019s passport, they sent",
    "The fruit home for ourselves to taste.",
    "Walter Llywarch\u2014the words were a name",
    "On a lost letter that never came",
    "For one who waited in the long queue",
    "Of life that wound through a Welsh valley.",
    "I took instead, as others had done",
    "Before, a wife from the back pews",
    "In chapel, rather to share the rain",
    "Of winter evenings, than to intrude",
    "On her pale body; and yet we lay",
    "For warmth together and laughed to hear",
    "Each new child\u2019s cry of despair."
