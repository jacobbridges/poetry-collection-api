    "All my life",
    "I was face to face",
    "with her, at meal-times,",
    "by the fire, even",
    "in the ultimate intimacies",
    "of the bed. You could have asked,",
    "then, for information",
    "about her? There was a room",
    "apart she kept herself in,",
    "teasing me by leading me",
    "to its glass door, only",
    "to confront me with",
    "my reflection. I learned from her",
    "even so. Walking her shore",
    "I found things cast up",
    "from her depths that spoke",
    "to me of another order,",
    "worshipper as I was",
    "of untamed nature. She fetched",
    "her treasures from art\u2019s",
    "storehouse: pieces of old",
    "lace, delicate as frost;",
    "china from a forgotten",
    "period; a purse more valuable",
    "than anything it could contain.",
    "Coming in from the fields",
    "with my offering of flowers",
    "I found her garden",
    "had forestalled me in providing",
    "civilities for my desk.",

    "I would say, \u2018you who were",
    "its messenger in the delivery",
    "of our child.\u2019 Her eyes had a",
    "fine shame, remembering her privacy",
    "being invaded from further off than",
    "she expected. \u2018Do you think",
    "death is the end?\u2019 frivolously",
    "I would ask her. I recall",
    "now the swiftness of its arrival",
    "wrenching her lip down, and how",
    "the upper remained firm,",
    "reticent as the bud that is",
    "the precursor of the flower."
