    "That there are things that can never be the same about",
    "my face, the houses, or the sand, that I was born under the",
    "sign of the sheep, that like Abraham Lincoln I am serious",
    "but also lacking in courage,",
    "That from this yard I have been composing a great speech,",
    "that I write about myself, that it\u2019s good to be a poet, that I look",
    "like the drawing of a house that was pencilled by a child,",
    "that curiously, I miss him and my mind is not upon the Pleaides,",
    "that I love the ocean and its foam against the sky,",
    "That I am sneezing like a lion in this garden that he knows",
    "the lilies of his Nile, distant image, breakfast, a flock of birds",
    "and sparrows from the sky,",
    "That I am not the husband of Cassiopeia, that I am not",
    "the southern fish, that I am not the last poet of civilization,",
    "that if I want to go out for a walk and then to find myself",
    "beneath a bank of trees, weary, that this is the life that I had,",
    "That curiously I miss the sound of the rain pounding",
    "on the roof and also all of Oakland, that I miss the sounds of",
    "sparrows dropping from the sky, that there are sparks behind",
    "my eyes, on the radio, and the distant sound of sand blasters,",
    "and breakfast, and every second of it, geometric, smoke",
    "from the chimney of the trees where I was small,",
    "That in January, I met him in a bar, we went",
    "home together, there was a lemon tree in the back yard,",
    "and a coffee house where we stood outside and kissed,",
    "That I have never been there, curiously, and that it never was",
    "the same, the whole of the island, or the paintings of the stars,",
    "fatherly, tied to sparrows as they drop down from the sky,",
    "O rattling frame where I am, I am where there are still",
    "these assignments in the night, to remember the texture",
    "of the leaves on the locust trees in August, under the",
    "moonlight, rounded, through a window in the hills,",
    "That if I stay beneath the pole star in this harmony of",
    "crickets that will sing, the bird sound on the screen,",
    "the wide eyes of the owl form of him still in the dark,",
    "blue, green, with shards of the Pacific,",
    "That I do not know the dreams from which I have come,",
    "sent into the world without the blessing of a kiss, behind the",
    "willow trees, beside the darkened pansies on the deck beside",
    "the ships, rocking, I have written this, across the back of the",
    "sky, wearing a small and yellow shirt, near the reptile house,",
    "mammalian, no bigger than the herd,",
    "That I wrote the history of the war waged between the",
    "Peloponnesians and the south, that I like to run through",
    "shopping malls, that I\u2019ve also learned to draw, having been",
    "driven here, like the rain is driven into things, into the",
    "ground, beside the broken barns, by the railroad tracks,",
    "beside the sea, I, Thucydides, having written this, having",
    "grown up near the ocean.",
