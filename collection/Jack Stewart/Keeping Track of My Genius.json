    "I sometimes find him in the attic,",
    "lying on his side, contemplating",
    "the insulation. Or just staring at",
    "the beams, trying to get the measure",
    "of force and distribution. He",
    "turns up a lot in the garage.",
    "I know he loves me. But if I look",
    "away for an instant, he's off,",
    "and I worry that he won't come back",
    "(or when he does he'll have no taste,",
    "gone in for some fad I'll have to bear,",
    "and every move he makes a test).",
    "But usually he's charming,",
    "following me to the cafe",
    "and lying on the awning so carefully",
    "as not to make it sag, only",
    "casting a slight shadow on my table.",
    "Of course I act as though I",
    "haven't seen a thing. He only wants,",
    "I think, to do what can't be done.",
    "Why just yesterday, for instance,",
    "I found him going through the public trash,",
    "figuring how to fill a bottle",
    "some angry drunk had smashed."
