    "to crave what the light does crave",
    "to shelter, to flee",
    "to gain desire of every splayed leaf",
    "to calm cattle, to heat the mare",
    "to coax dead flies back from slumber",
    "to turn the gaze of each opened bud",
    "to ripe the fruit to rot the fruit",
    "and drive down under the earth",
    "to lord gentle dust",
    "to lend a glancing grace to llamas",
    "to gather dampness from fields",
    "and divide birds",
    "and divide the ewes from slaughter",
    "and raise the corn and bend the wheat",
    "and drive tractors to ruin",
    "burnish the fox, brother the hawk",
    "shed the snake, bloom the weed",
    "and drive all wind diurnal",
    "to blanch the fire and clot the cloud",
    "to husk, to harvest,",
    "sheave and chaff",
    "to choose the bird",
    "and voice the bird",
    "to sing us, veery, into darkness"
