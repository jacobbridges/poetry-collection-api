    "It's not exile, homes and families behind",
    "us, where we meet. It happens anywhere,",
    "now: a stateless",
    "state of no name, quietly seceding",
    "from the crumbling empires round us,",
    "without stamps or Eurovision entries.",
    "No-one does it with a rough guide in a week.",
    "You inhabit it",
    "or nothing. Like this: in a pavement cafe",
    "you blink and you seem to surprise them,",
    "the crowd, all its separate faces at once,",
    "coming out of solution like crystals,",
    "like a rush of starlings",
    "or the breeze that lifts the canvas awning",
    "now and dents your cappuccino froth",
    "with a crisp little sound. And that's it:",
    "between breaths, just between you and me",
    "as if; yes,",
    "QED. You are received. This is",
    "the freedom of the city, and the key",
    "to the kingdom, and its borders ripple",
    "outwards like a frill of breaking wave",
    "onto flat sand,",
    "a wavering line already fading leaving",
    "spume-flecks high and dry,",
    "a prickling on your palm; you're five",
    "years old, looking up at the whole sea,",
    "unsure:",
    "will you laugh or cry?"
