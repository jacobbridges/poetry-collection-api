    "would clash, if they would clang like the clutch",
    "of pale monkeys clanging the thin branches of the treetrops,",

    "I don't mind. Eventually you turn us back to a place",
    "not on any map, but I know I can trace it back with my finger",
    "if we ever need it again. We made it one year",
    "without a compass and we\u2019re not about to start now."
