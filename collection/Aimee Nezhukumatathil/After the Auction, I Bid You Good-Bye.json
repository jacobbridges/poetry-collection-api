    "You elbow me with your corduroy jacket",
    "when a box chock-full of antique marbles comes up.",
    "I can\u2019t hear your whispers above the auctioneer\u2019s racket.",
    "The clipped speech of the auctioneer cracked",
    "me up when you impersonated him in bed. Like a wild, thick mop",
    "I soak up every copper smell from your corduroy jacket.",
    "In two days, I will drive you to the airport, packed",
    "with other couples pressed tightly at the top",
    "of the escalator. Lines sear my cheek from your corduroy jacket",
    "when we hug\u2014then a quick kiss good-bye tacked",
    "on at the end. I\u2019ll finger the rim on the paper coffee cup",
    "you leave in my car. When I hear your name I can\u2019t forget",
    "how your long torso pressed against my bare back,",
    "bluish in this early light. Your fingers shot into me, popped",
    "my spine into a wicked arch. There is no lack",
    "of how it haunts me still\u2014what I bid\u2014lost, sacked",
    "and wrapped for other girls. I should have looked up",
    "to see who else was bidding, but I studied the folds in your jacket.",
    "My limit is spent, loud and certain as the auctioneer\u2019s racket."
