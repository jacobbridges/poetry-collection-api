    "Some girls on the other side of this planet",
    "will never know the loveliness",
    "of walking in a crepe silk sari. Instead,",
    "they will spend their days on their backs",
    "for a parade of men who could be their uncles",
    "in another life. These girls memorize",
    "each slight wobble of fan blade as it cuts",
    "through the stale tea air and auto-rickshaw",
    "exhaust, thick as egg curry.",
    "Men shove greasy rupees at the door",
    "for one hour in a room",
    "with a twelve-year-old. One hour \u2014 One hour \u2014",
    "One hour. And if she cries afterward,",
    "her older sister will cover it up. Will rim",
    "the waterline of her eyes with kohl pencil",
    "until it looks like two silk moths",
    "have stopped to rest on her exquisite face."
