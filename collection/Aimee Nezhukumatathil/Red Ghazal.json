    "I\u2019ve noticed after a few sips of tea, the tip of her tongue, thin and red",
    "with heat, quickens when she describes her cuts and bruises\u2014deep violets and red.",
    "The little girl I baby-sit, hair orange and wild, sits splayed and upside down",
    "on a couch, insists her giant book of dinosaurs is the only one she\u2019ll ever read.",
    "The night before I left him, I could not sleep, my eyes fixed on the freckles",
    "of his shoulder, the glow of the clock, my chest heavy with dread.",
    "Scientists say they\u2019ll force a rabbit to a bird, a jellyfish with a snake, even",
    "though the pairs clearly do not mix. Some things are not meant to be bred.",
    "I almost forgot the weight of a man sitting beside me in bed sheets crumpled",
    "around our waists, both of us with magazines, laughing at the thing he just read.",
    "He was so charming\u2014pointed out planets, ghost galaxies, an ellipsis",
    "of ants on the wall. And when he kissed me goodnight, my neck reddened.",
    "I\u2019m terrible at cards. Friends huddle in for Euchre, Hearts\u2014beg me to play",
    "with them. When it\u2019s obvious I can clearly win with a black card, I select a red.",
    "I throw away my half-finished letters to him in my tiny pink wastebasket, but",
    "my aim is no good. The floor is scattered with fire hazards, declarations unread."
