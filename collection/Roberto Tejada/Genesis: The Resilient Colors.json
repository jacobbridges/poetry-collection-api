    "And surfaced a flame in the dark elsewhere",
    "of one remembered form: just one,",
    "suppose it the flesh of unspecified man",
    "a mouth down deeper between my legs",
    "his heavy beard in the beginning",
    "against these wet thighs our bodies scribbled",
    "in signs to draw the grey curtain of steam back",
    "by which we found ourselves surrounded",
    "sound of water off the tile (or on this sheet",
    "of paper stammering) by which we came to nestle",
    "a will from which the colors rose resilient",
    "sparks of orange over the waves of trickled",
    "hair on chest and forearm light",
    "green to trace the conduits formed by",
    "vein of biceps and prick the pink",
    "ridges of his brown nipples in brackets raised",
    "this tongue in blue translucent embers",
    "to emanate where a moon of fingers along",
    "the dark red notch of earth is a field",
    "over which armies raged with catapults of burning",
    "stones until all was left there smoldering below."
