    "I can hear him,",
    "now, even in darkness,",
    "a trickster under the moon,",
    "bristling his feathers,",
    "sounding as merry",
    "as a man whistling in a straw hat,",
    "or a squeaky gate",
    "to the playground, left ajar",
    "or the jingling of a star,",
    "having wandered too far",
    "from the pasture."
