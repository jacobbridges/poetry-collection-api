    "Late in the cold night wakened, and heard wind,",
    "And lay with eyes closed and silent, knowing",
    "These words how bodiless they are, this darkness",
    "Empty under my roof and the panes rattling",
    "Roughed by wind. And so lay and imagined",
    "Somewhere far off black seas heavy-shouldered",
    "Plunging on sand and the ebb off-streaming and",
    "Thunder forever. So lying bethought me, friend,",
    "What traffic ghouls have, or this be legend,",
    "In low inland hollows of the earth, under",
    "Shade of moon, the night moaning, and bitter frost;",
    "And feared the riches of my bones, long given",
    "Into this earth, should tumble to their hands.",
    "No girl or ghost beside me, and I lonely,",
    "Remembering gardens, lilac scent, or twilight",
    "Descending late in summer on that town,",
    "I lay and found my years departed from me,",
    "And feared the cold bed and the wind, absurdly",
    "Alone with silence and the trick of tears."
