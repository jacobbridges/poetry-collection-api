    "The adolescent night, breath of the town,",
    "Porchswings and whispers, maple leaves unseen",
    "Deploying moonlight quieter than a man dead",
    "After the locust\u2019s song. These homes were mine",
    "And are not now forever, these on the steps",
    "Children I think removed to many places,",
    "Lost among hushed years, and so strangely known.",
    "This business is well ended. If in the dark",
    "The firefly made his gleam and sank therefrom,",
    "Yet someone\u2019s hand would have him, the wet grass",
    "Bed him no more. From corners of the lawn",
    "The dusk-white dresses flutter and are past.",
    "Before our bed time there were things to say,",
    "Remembering tree-bark, crickets, and the first star\u2026",
    "After, and as the sullenness of time",
    "Went on from summer, here in a land alien",
    "Made I my perfect fears and flower of thought:",
    "Sleep being no longer swift in the arms of pain,",
    "Revisitations are convenient with a cough,",
    "And there is something I would say again",
    "If I had not forever, if there were time."
