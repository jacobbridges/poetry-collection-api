    "This bald year, frozen now in February.",
    "This cold day winging over the ugly",
    "Imperfect horizon line,",
    "So often a teeth line of ten buildings.",
    "A red flag flapping",
    "In the wind. An orange curtain is noon.",
    "It all hurts her eyes. This curtain is so bright.",
    "Here is what is noticeably true: sight.",
    "The face that looks back from the side",
    "Of the butter knife.",
    "A torn-bread awkwardness.",
    "The mind makes its daily pilgrimage",
    "Through riff-raff moments. Then,",
    "Back into the caprice case to dream",
    "In a circle, a pony goes round.",
    "The circle's association: There's a center",
    "To almost everything but never",
    "Any certainty. Nothing is",
    "More malleable than a moment. We were",
    "Only yesterday breathing in a sea.",
    "Some summer sun",
    "Asked us over and over we went. The sand was hot.",
    "We were only yesterday tender hearted",
    "Waiting. To be something.",
    "A spring. And then someone says, Sit down,",
    "We have a heart for you to forget. A mind to suffer",
    "With. So, experience. So, the circus tent.",
    "You, over there, you be the girl",
    "In red sequins on the front of a card selling love.",
    "You, over there, you, in black satin.",
    "You be the Maiden's Mister Death."
