    "September is work to the center",
    "Of arguments and controversies.",
    "Prejudgments and incomprehensions.",
    "What will I love if not that",
    "That was enigma?",
    "The years of infancy, Memory says,",
    "And there we are, with the demon",
    "Of the art of living",
    "Traced on the glass of some window.",
    "In the beauty of the night of May,",
    "Clear of moon, to the lume of a candle",
    "There was a design like the profile",
    "Of a landscape almost abandoned. Gone",
    "But not gone yet. It's fascinating,",
    "These mysterious uncovered feelings.",
    "Enigma of an afternoon of autumn, the picture",
    "Of which is a composition",
    "Of the eye of my mind. Every hour",
    "That I watch this picture",
    "I see again still that moment.",
    "Nevertheless the moment is an enigma",
    "For me, in how much is inexplicable.",
    "The physical things hide in the architecture",
    "Of the event. The enigma of a mock-up,",
    "Of a shadow, the spectral and eternal aspect",
    "Of the moment. Praises to you for being",
    "One great box of surprise,",
    "Your head the scene of a wonderful theater",
    "Of the most tender gray of the fog",
    "That joins the sky to the earth.",
    "A tangling of truth and memory,",
    "Mythology and iconography,",
    "I watch with the eye",
    "Of the mind the city that accommodates",
    "That one beautiful day that is now infinite.",
    "It deepens. It begins. The cyclical method.",
    "Memory is deeply not alive; it's a mock-up",
    "And this renders it hateful. Yet, it is not a fiction,",
    "Is a truth, indeed a sad and monstrous truth.",
    "I was assigned to you, together we were",
    "A beautiful and melancholic picture.",
    "This last picture is the realization",
    "Of the overwhelming moment",
    "In which the acute eye perceives you as a now",
    "That is over. A now that is fixed",
    "In the swept past."
