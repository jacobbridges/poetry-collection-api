    "The story is written, the slip of a girl is loosed",
    "And her life folds over. Against the cold, the waiting",
    "For the what will happen. The next. Wonderful",
    "Awful. The blonde in a chemical bath.",
    "The story keeps on being written",
    "As a woman who waits for never to happen",
    "As an empty wall waits for light to form a bridge",
    "And under it, a mass of open eyes,",
    "Waiting for the awful eventual. Now?",
    "And yes is what is said. Then here it is, the box",
    "We live in where the crazy face of the day looks back",
    "At the closed eye of the night looking in.",
    "A boy of four comes in as an example",
    "Of where the door of life is left open for a moment.",
    "Time tumbles hour after hour until it's morning again.",
    "Some glass is for looking through, some is for seeing back.",
    "Every outline is a cage one way or another."
