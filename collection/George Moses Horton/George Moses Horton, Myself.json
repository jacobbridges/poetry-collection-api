    "I feel myself in need",
    "Of the inspiring strains of ancient lore,",
    "My heart to lift, my empty mind to feed,",
    "And all the world explore.",
    "I know that I am old",
    "And never can recover what is past,",
    "But for the future may some light unfold",
    "And soar from ages blast.",
    "I feel resolved to try,",
    "My wish to prove, my calling to pursue,",
    "Or mount up from the earth into the sky,",
    "To show what Heaven can do.",
    "My genius from a boy,",
    "Has fluttered like a bird within my heart;",
    "But could not thus confined her powers employ,",
    "Impatient to depart.",
    "She like a restless bird,",
    "Would spread her wing, her power to be unfurl\u2019d,",
    "And let her songs be loudly heard,",
    "And dart from world to world."
