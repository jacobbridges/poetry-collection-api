    "Next to my own skin, her pearls. My mistress",
    "bids me wear them, warm them, until evening",
    "when I'll brush her hair. At six, I place them",
    "round her cool, white throat. All day I think of her,",
    "resting in the Yellow Room, contemplating silk",
    "or taffeta, which gown tonight? She fans herself",
    "whilst I work willingly, my slow heat entering",
    "each pearl. Slack on my neck, her rope.",
    "She's beautiful. I dream about her",
    "in my attic bed; picture her dancing",
    "with tall men, puzzled by my faint, persistent scent",
    "beneath her French perfume, her milky stones.",
    "I dust her shoulders with a rabbit's foot,",
    "watch the soft blush seep through her skin",
    "like an indolent sigh. In her looking-glass",
    "my red lips part as though I want to speak.",
    "Full moon. Her carriage brings her home. I see",
    "her every movement in my head.... Undressing,",
    "taking off her jewels, her slim hand reaching",
    "for the case, slipping naked into bed, the way",
    "she always does.... And I lie here awake,",
    "knowing the pearls are cooling even now",
    "in the room where my mistress sleeps. All night",
    "I feel their absence and I burn."
