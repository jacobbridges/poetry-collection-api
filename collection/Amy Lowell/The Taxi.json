    "When I go away from you",
    "The world beats dead",
    "Like a slackened drum.",

    "And shout into the ridges of the wind.",
    "Streets coming fast,",
    "One after the other,",
    "Wedge you away from me,",
    "And the lamps of the city prick my eyes",
    "So that I can no longer see your face.",
    "Why should I leave you,",
    "To wound myself upon the sharp edges of the night?"
