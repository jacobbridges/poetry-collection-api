    "I want no horns to rouse me up to-night,",
    "And trumpets make too clamorous a ring",
    "To fit my mood, it is so weary white",
    "I have no wish for doing any thing.",
    "A music coaxed from humming strings would please;",
    "Not plucked, but drawn in creeping cadences",
    "Across a sunset wall where some Marquise",
    "Picks a pale rose amid strange silences.",
    "Ghostly and vaporous her gown sweeps by",
    "The twilight dusking wall, I hear her feet",
    "Delaying on the gravel, and a sigh,",
    "Briefly permitted, touches the air like sleet",
    "And it is dark, I hear her feet no more.",
    "A red moon leers beyond the lily-tank.",
    "A drunken moon ogling a sycamore,",
    "Running long fingers down its shining flank.",
    "A lurching moon, as nimble as a clown,",
    "Cuddling the flowers and trees which burn like glass.",
    "Red, kissing lips, I feel you on my gown\u2014",
    "Kiss me, red lips, and then pass\u2014pass.",
    "Music, you are pitiless to-night.",
    "And I so old, so cold, so languorously white."
