    "Gushing from the mouths of stone men",
    "To spread at ease under the sky",
    "In granite-lipped basins,",
    "Where iris dabble their feet",
    "And rustle to a passing wind,",
    "The water fills the garden with its rushing,",
    "In the midst of the quiet of close-clipped lawns.",
    "Damp smell the ferns in tunnels of stone,",
    "Where trickle and plash the fountains,",
    "Marble fountains, yellowed with much water.",
    "Splashing down moss-tarnished steps",
    "It falls, the water;",
    "And the air is throbbing with it;",
    "With its gurgling and running;",
    "With its leaping, and deep, cool murmur.",
    "And I wished for night and you.",
    "I wanted to see you in the swimming-pool,",
    "White and shining in the silver-flecked water.",
    "While the moon rode over the garden,",
    "High in the arch of night,",
    "And the scent of the lilacs was heavy with stillness.",
    "Night and the water, and you in your whiteness, bathing!"
