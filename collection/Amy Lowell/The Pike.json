    "In the brown water,",
    "Thick and silver-sheened in the sunshine,",
    "Liquid and cool in the shade of the reeds,",
    "A pike dozed.",
    "Lost among the shadows of stems",
    "He lay unnoticed.",
    "Suddenly he flicked his tail,",
    "And a green-and-copper brightness",
    "Ran under the water.",
    "Out from under the reeds",
    "Came the olive-green light,",
    "And orange flashed up",
    "Through the sun-thickened water.",
    "So the fish passed across the pool,",
    "Green and copper,",
    "A darkness and a gleam,",
    "And the blurred reflections of the willows on the opposite bank",
    "Received it."
