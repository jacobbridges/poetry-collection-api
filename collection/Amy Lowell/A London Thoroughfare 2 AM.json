    "They have watered the street,",
    "It shines in the glare of lamps,",
    "Cold, white lamps,",
    "And lies",
    "Like a slow-moving river,",
    "Barred with silver and black.",
    "Cabs go down it,",
    "One,",
    "And then another.",
    "Between them I hear the shuffling of feet.",
    "Tramps doze on the window-ledges,",
    "Night-walkers pass along the sidewalks.",
    "The city is squalid and sinister,",
    "With the silver-barred street in the midst,",
    "Slow-moving,",
    "A river leading nowhere.",
    "Opposite my window,",
    "The moon cuts,",
    "Clear and round,",
    "Through the plum-coloured night.",
    "She cannot light the city;",
    "It is too bright.",
    "It has white lamps,",
    "And glitters coldly.",
    "I stand in the window and watch the moon.",
    "She is thin and lustreless,",
    "But I love her.",
    "I know the moon,",
    "And this is an alien city."
