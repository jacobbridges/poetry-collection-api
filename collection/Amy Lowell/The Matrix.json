    "Goaded and harassed in the factory",
    "That tears our life up into bits of days",
    "Ticked off upon a clock which never stays,",
    "Shredding our portion of Eternity,",
    "We break away at last, and steal the key",
    "Which hides a world empty of hours; ways",
    "Of space unroll, and Heaven overlays",
    "The leafy, sun-lit earth of Fantasy.",
    "Beyond the ilex shadow glares the sun,",
    "Scorching against the blue flame of the sky.",
    "Brown lily-pads lie heavy and supine",
    "Within a granite basin, under one",
    "The bronze-gold glimmer of a carp; and I",
    "Reach out my hand and pluck a nectarine."
