    "Pale, with the blue of high zeniths, shimmered over with silver, brocaded",
    "In smooth, running patterns, a soft stuff, with dark knotted fringes, it lies there,",
    "Warm from a woman\u2019s soft shoulders, and my fingers close on it, caressing.",
    "Where is she, the woman who wore it? The scent of her lingers and drugs me.",
    "A languor, fire-shotted, runs through me, and I crush the scarf down on my face,",
    "And gulp in the warmth and the blueness, and my eyes swim in cool-tinted heavens.",
    "Around me are columns of marble, and a diapered, sun-flickered pavement.",
    "Rose-leaves blow and patter against it. Below the stone steps a lute tinkles.",
    "A jar of green jade throws its shadow half over the floor. A big-bellied",
    "Frog hops through the sunlight, and plops in the gold-bubbled water of a basin,",
    "Sunk in the black and white marble. The west wind has lifted a scarf",
    "On the seat close beside me; the blue of it is a violent outrage of colour.",
    "She draws it more closely about her, and it ripples beneath her slight stirring.",
    "Her kisses are sharp buds of fire; and I burn back against her, a jewel",
    "Hard and white, a stalked, flaming flower; till I break to a handful of cinders,",
    "And open my eyes to the scarf, shining blue in the afternoon sunshine.",
    "How loud clocks can tick when a room is empty, and one is alone!"
