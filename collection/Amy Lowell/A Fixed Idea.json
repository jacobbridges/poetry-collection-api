    "What torture lurks within a single thought",
    "When grown too constant; and however kind,",
    "However welcome still, the weary mind",
    "Aches with its presence. Dull remembrance taught",
    "Remembers on unceasingly; unsought",
    "The old delight is with us but to find",
    "That all recurring joy is pain refined,",
    "Become a habit, and we struggle, caught.",
    "You lie upon my heart as on a nest,",
    "Folded in peace, for you can never know",
    "How crushed I am with having you at rest",
    "Heavy upon my life. I love you so",
    "You bind my freedom from its rightful quest.",
    "In mercy lift your drooping wings and go."
