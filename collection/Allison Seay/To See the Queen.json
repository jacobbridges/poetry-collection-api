    "Since I was the one who had been ill, it was me she came to see.",
    "Everyone wanted a glimpse of her.",
    "The people emerged from their houses toward mine",
    "and with such caution.",
    "They made a visor of their hands.",
    "It was as if they were to be accounted for,",
    "wading the long uphill, little moving triangles",
    "all I could distinguish at first.",
    "But the queen came to see only me and I saw her.",
    "And my life for a while was dismissed",
    "and so repaired."
