    "Knots like two dozen fists",
    "swayed with want from the boy\u2019s",
    "kaffiyeh, that black and white scarf",
    "with its useless hands clopping",
    "against the wind in protest",
    "against this boy and his somebody",
    "lost, against their own swaying",
    "in a dance the lost body has lost.",
    "A boy. A somebody lost. A body bodied",
    "in the lights of inauguration night",
    "when every light in the city flared",
    "with hope. Always losing, always",
    "a boy left with a dozen weights,",
    "small circles on strings pulling",
    "his head down to the ground.",
    "Downcast. Drop your bucket here",
    "and make the city yours and all",
    "that jive keeps him from running.",
    "Escaping the pavement, where",
    "bodies finally fall to rest.",
    "The kaffiyeh keeps him from",
    "bucking against the wind,",
    "hurtling himself to the Grey-",
    "hound or Amtrak or",
    "-95",
    "with a book bag and hitched finger.",
    "His head shrouded in the black",
    "and white, the knots keeping",
    "his eyes down as he traverses",
    "neighborhoods with names like 3rd",
    "World, with names like a nation",
    "falling. And the coffin-voiced",
    "boy is who god tells us he will",
    "save, and so those swinging knots",
    "must be a kind of redemption,",
    "a way to see the bullets that bury",
    "you, constantly, as if death is",
    "the disguise hiding your wings."
