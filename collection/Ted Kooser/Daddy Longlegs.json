    "Here, on fine long legs springy as steel,",
    "a life rides, sealed in a small brown pill",
    "that skims along over the basement floor",
    "wrapped up in a simple obsession.",
    "Eight legs reach out like the master ribs",
    "of a web in which some thought is caught",
    "dead center in its own small world,",
    "a thought so far from the touch of things",
    "that we can only guess at it. If mine,",
    "it would be the secret dream",
    "of walking alone across the floor of my life",
    "with an easy grace, and with love enough",
    "to live on at the center of myself."
