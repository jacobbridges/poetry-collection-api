    "He was a big man, says the size of his shoes",
    "on a pile of broken dishes by the house;",
    "a tall man too, says the length of the bed",
    "in an upstairs room; and a good, God-fearing man,",
    "says the Bible with a broken back",
    "on the floor below the window, dusty with sun;",
    "but not a man for farming, say the fields",
    "cluttered with boulders and the leaky barn.",
    "A woman lived with him, says the bedroom wall",
    "papered with lilacs and the kitchen shelves",
    "covered with oilcloth, and they had a child,",
    "says the sandbox made from a tractor tire.",
    "Money was scarce, say the jars of plum preserves",
    "and canned tomatoes sealed in the cellar hole.",
    "And the winters cold, say the rags in the window frames.",
    "It was lonely here, says the narrow country road.",
    "Something went wrong, says the empty house",
    "in the weed-choked yard. Stones in the fields",
    "say he was not a farmer; the still-sealed jars",
    "in the cellar say she left in a nervous haste.",
    "And the child? Its toys are strewn in the yard",
    "like branches after a storm\u2014a rubber cow,",
    "a rusty tractor with a broken plow,",
    "a doll in overalls. Something went wrong, they say."
