    "On a parking lot staircase",
    "I met two fine-looking men",
    "descending, both in slacks",
    "and dress shirts, neckties",
    "much alike, one of the men",
    "in his sixties, the other",
    "a good twenty years older,",
    "unsteady on his polished shoes,",
    "a son and his father, I knew",
    "from their looks, the son with his",
    "right hand on the handrail,",
    "the father, left hand on the left,",
    "and in the middle they were",
    "holding hands, and when I neared,",
    "they opened the simple gate",
    "of their interwoven fingers",
    "to let me pass, then reached out",
    "for each other and continued on."
