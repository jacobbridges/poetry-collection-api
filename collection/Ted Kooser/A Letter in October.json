    "Dawn comes later and later now,",
    "and I, who only a month ago",
    "could sit with coffee every morning",
    "watching the light walk down the hill",
    "to the edge of the pond and place",
    "a doe there, shyly drinking,",
    "then see the light step out upon",
    "the water, sowing reflections",
    "to either side\u2014a garden",
    "of trees that grew as if by magic\u2014",
    "now see no more than my face,",
    "mirrored by darkness, pale and odd,",
    "startled by time. While I slept,",
    "night in its thick winter jacket",
    "bridled the doe with a twist",
    "of wet leaves and led her away,",
    "then brought its black horse with harness",
    "that creaked like a cricket, and turned",
    "the water garden under. I woke,",
    "and at the waiting window found",
    "the curtains open to my open face;",
    "beyond me, darkness. And I,",
    "who only wished to keep looking out,",
    "must now keep looking in."
