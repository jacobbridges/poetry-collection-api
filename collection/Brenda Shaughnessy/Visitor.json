    "I am dreaming of a house just like this one",
    "but larger and opener to the trees, nighter",
    "than day and higher than noon, and you,",
    "visiting, knocking to get in, hoping for icy",
    "milk or hot tea or whatever it is you like.",
    "For each night is a long drink in a short glass.",
    "A drink of blacksound water, such a rush",
    "and fall of lonesome no form can contain it.",
    "And if it isn\u2019t night yet, though I seem to",
    "recall that it is, then it is not for everyone.",
    "Did you receive my invitation? It is not",
    "for everyone. Please come to my house",
    "lit by leaf light. It\u2019s like a book with bright",
    "pages filled with flocks and glens and groves",
    "and overlooked by Pan, that seductive satyr",
    "in whom the fish is also cooked. A book that",
    "took too long to read but minutes to unread\u2014",
    "that is\u2014to forget. Strange are the pages",
    "thus. Nothing but the hope of company.",
    "I made too much pie in expectation. I was",
    "hoping to sit with you in a tree house in a",
    "nightgown in a real way. Did you receive",
    "my invitation? Written in haste, before",
    "leaf blinked out, before the idea fully formed.",
    "An idea like a storm cloud that does not spill",
    "or arrive but moves silently in a direction.",
    "Like a dark book in a long life with a vague",
    "hope in a wood house with an open door."
