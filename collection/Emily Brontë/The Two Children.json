    "Heavy hangs the raindrop",
    "From the burdened spray;",
    "Heavy broods the damp mist",
    "On uplands far away;",
    "Heavy looms the dull sky,",
    "Heavy rolls the sea\u2014",
    "And heavy beats the young heart",
    "Beneath that lonely tree.",
    "Never has a blue streak",
    "Cleft the clouds since morn\u2014",
    "Never has his grim Fate",
    "Smiled since he was born.",
    "Frowning on the infant,",
    "Shadowing childhood\u2019s joy,",
    "Guardian angel knows not",
    "That melancholy boy.",
    "Day is passing swiftly",
    "Its sad and sombre prime;",
    "Youth is fast invading",
    "Sterner manhood\u2019s time.",
    "All the flowers are praying",
    "For sun before they close,",
    "And he prays too, unknowing,",
    "That sunless human rose!",
    "Blossoms, that the west wind",
    "Has never wooed to blow,",
    "Scentless are your petals,",
    "Your dew as cold as snow.",
    "Soul, where kindred kindness",
    "No early promise woke,",
    "Barren is your beauty",
    "As weed upon the rock.",
    "Wither, Brothers, wither,",
    "You were vainly given\u2014",
    "Earth reserves no blessing",
    "For the unblessed of Heaven!",
    "Child of Delight! with sunbright hair,",
    "And seablue, seadeep eyes;",
    "Spirit of Bliss, what brings thee here,",
    "Beneath these sullen skies?",
    "Thou shouldst live in eternal spring,",
    "Where endless day is never dim;",
    "Why, seraph, has thy erring wing",
    "Borne thee down to weep with him?",
    "\u201cAh, not from heaven am I descended,",
    "And I do not come to mingle tears;",
    "But sweet is day, though with shadows blended;",
    "And, though clouded, sweet are youthful years.",
    "\u201cI, the image of light and gladness,",
    "Saw and pitied that mournful boy,",
    "And I swore to take his gloomy sadness,",
    "And give to him my beamy joy.",
    "\u201cHeavy and dark the night is closing;",
    "Heavy and dark may its biding be:",
    "Better for all from grief reposing,",
    "And better for all who watch like me.",
    "\u201cGuardian angel, he lacks no longer;",
    "Evil fortune he need not fear:",
    "Fate is strong, but Love is stronger;",
    "And more unsleeping than angel\u2019s care.\u201d"
