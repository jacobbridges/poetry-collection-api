    "O thy bright eyes must answer now,",
    "When Reason, with a scornful brow,",
    "Is mocking at my overthrow;",
    "O thy sweet tongue must plead for me",
    "And tell why I have chosen thee!",
    "Stern Reason is to judgment come",
    "Arrayed in all her forms of gloom:",
    "Wilt thou my advocate be dumb?",
    "No, radiant angel, speak and say",
    "Why I did cast the world away;",
    "Why I have persevered to shun",
    "The common paths that others run;",
    "And on a strange road journeyed on",
    "Heedless alike of Wealth and Power\u2014",
    "Of Glory's wreath and Pleasure's flower.",
    "These once indeed seemed Beings divine,",
    "And they perchance heard vows of mine",
    "And saw my offerings on their shrine\u2014",
    "But, careless gifts are seldom prized,",
    "And mine were worthily despised;",
    "So with a ready heart I swore",
    "To seek their altar-stone no more,",
    "And gave my spirit to adore",
    "Thee, ever present, phantom thing\u2014",
    "My slave, my comrade, and my King!",
    "A slave because I rule thee still;",
    "Incline thee to my changeful will",
    "And make thy influence good or ill\u2014",
    "A comrade, for by day and night",
    "Thou art my intimate delight\u2014",
    "My Darling Pain that wounds and sears",
    "And wrings a blessing out from tears",
    "By deadening me to real cares;",
    "And yet, a king\u2014though prudence well",
    "Have taught thy subject to rebel.",
    "And am I wrong to worship where",
    "Faith cannot doubt nor Hope despair,",
    "Since my own soul can grant my prayer?",
    "Speak, God of Visions, plead for me",
    "And tell why I have chosen thee!"
