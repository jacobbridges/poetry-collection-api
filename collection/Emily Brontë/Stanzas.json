    "There's nothing lovely here;",
    "And doubly will the dark world grieve me,",

    "Must always end in gloom;",
    "And, follow out the happiest story\u2014",
    "It closes with a tomb!",
    "And I am weary of the anguish",
    "Increasing winters bear;",
    "Weary to watch the spirit languish",
    "Through years of dead despair.",
    "So, if a tear, when thou art dying,",
    "Should haply fall from me,",
    "It is but that my soul is sighing,",
    "To go and rest with thee."
