    "\u2018whose words we gathered as pleasant flowers",
    "and thought on his wit and how neatly he described things\u2019",
    "speaks",
    "to us, hatching marrow,",
    "broody all night over the bones of a deadman.",
    "My tongue is a curve in the ear. Vision is lies.",

    "scratched on black by God knows who,",
    "by God, by God knows who.",
    "In the dark in fetters",
    "on bended elbows I supported my weak back",
    "hulloing to muffled walls blank again",
    "unresonant. It was gone, is silent, is always silent.",
    "My soundbox lacks sonority. All but inaudible",
    "I stammer to my ear:",
    "Naked speech! Naked beggar both blind and cold!",
    "Wrap it for my sake in Paisley shawls and bright soft fabric,",
    "wrap it in curves and cover it with sleek lank hair.",
    "What trumpets? What bright hands? Fetters, it was the Emperor",
    "with magic in darkness, I unforewained.",
    "The golden hands are not in Averrhoes,",
    "eyes lie and this swine\u2019s fare bread and water",
    "makes my head wuzz. Have pity, have pity on me!",
    "To the right was darkness and to the left hardness",
    "below hardness darkness above",
    "at the feet darkness at the head partial hardness",
    "with equal intervals without",
    "to the left moaning and beyond a scurry.",
    "In those days rode the good Lorraine",
    "whom English burned at Rouen,",
    "the day\u2019s bones whitening in centuries\u2019 dust.",
    "Then he saw his ghosts glitter with golden hands,",
    "the Emperor sliding up and up from his tomb",
    "alongside Charles. These things are not obliterate.",

    "sots and ascetics, fair and foul,",
    "young girls with little tender tits,",
    "that",
    "is written over all.",
    "Worn hides that scarcely clothe the soul",
    "they are so rotten, old and thin,",
    "or firm and soft and warm and full\u2014",
    "fellmonger Death gets every skin.",

    "all that is fat and scant of breath,",
    "Elisha\u2019s baldness, Helen\u2019s hair,",
    "is Death\u2019s collateral:",
    "Three score and ten years after sight",

    "like Tyro and Antiope",
    "drift among ghosts in Hell,",
    "know nothing, are nothing, save a fume",
    "driving across a mind",
    "preoccupied with this: our doom",
    "is, to be sifted by the wind,",
    "heaped up, smoothed down like silly sands.",
    "We are less permanent than thought.",
    "The Emperor with the Golden Hands",
    "is still a word, a tint, a tone,",
    "insubstantial-glorious,",
    "when we ourselves are dead and gone",
    "and the green grass growing over us.",
    "II",
    "Let his days be few and let",
    "his bishoprick pass to another,",
    "for he fed me on carrion and on a dry crust,",
    "mouldy bread that his dogs had vomited,",
    "I lying on my back in the dark place, in the grave,",
    "fettered to a post in the damp cellarage.",
    "Whereinall we differ not. But they have swept the floor,",
    "there are no dancers, no somersaulters now,",
    "only bricks and bleak black cement and bricks,",
    "only the military tread and the snap of the locks.",
    "Mine was a threeplank bed whereon",
    "I lay and cursed the weary sun.",
    "They took away the prison clothes",
    "and on the frosty nights I froze.",
    "I had a Bible where I read",
    "that Jesus came to raise the dead\u2014",
    "I kept myself from going mad",
    "by singing an old bawdy ballad",
    "and birds sang on my windowsill",
    "and tortured me till I was ill,",
    "but Archipiada came to me",
    "and comforted my cold body",
    "and Circe excellent utterer of her mind",
    "lay with me in that dungeon for a year",
    "making a silk purse from an old sow\u2019s ear",
    "till Ronsard put a thimble on her tongue.",
    "Whereinall we differ not. But they have named all the stars,",
    "trodden down the scrub of the desert, run the white moon to a schedule,",
    "Joshua\u2019s serf whose beauty drove men mad.",
    "They have melted the snows from Erebus, weighed the clouds,",
    "hunted down the white bear, hunted the whale the seal the kangaroo,",
    "they have set private enquiry agents onto Archipiada:",
    "What is your name? Your maiden name?",
    "Go in there to be searched. I suspect it is not your true name.",
    "Distinguishing marks if any? (O anthropometrics!)",
    "Now the thumbprints for filing.",
    "Colour of hair? of eyes? of hands? O Bertillon!",
    "How many golden prints on the smudgy page?",
    "Homer? Adest. Dante? Adest.",
    "Adsunt omnes, omnes et",
    "Villon.",
    "Villon?",
    "Blacked by the sun, washed by the rain,",
    "hither and thither scurrying as the wind varies.",
    "III",
    "Under the olive trees",
    "walking alone",
    "on the green terraces",
    "very seldom",
    "over the sea seldom",
    "where it ravelled and spun",
    "blue tapestries white and green",
    "gravecloths of men",
    "Romans and modern men",
    "and the men of the sea",
    "who have neither nation nor time",
    "on the mountains seldom",
    "the white mountains beyond",
    "or the brown mountains between",
    "and their drifting echoes",
    "in the clouds and over the sea",
    "in shrines on their ridges",
    "the goddess of the country",
    "silverplated in silk and embroidery",
    "with offerings of pictures",
    "little ships and arms",
    "below me the ports",
    "with naked breasts",
    "shipless spoiled sacked",
    "because of the beauty of Helen",
    "precision clarifying vagueness;",
    "boundary to a wilderness",
    "of detail; chisel voice",
    "smoothing the flanks of noise;",
    "catalytic making whisper and whisper",
    "run together like two drops of quicksilver;",
    "factor that resolves",
    "unnoted harmonies;",
    "name of the nameless;",
    "stuff that clings",
    "to frigid limbs",
    "more marble hard",
    "than girls imagined by Mantegna ...",
    "The sea has no renewal, no forgetting,",
    "no variety of death,",
    "is silent with the silence of a single note.",
    "How can I sing with my love in my bosom?",
    "Unclean, immature and unseasonable salmon."
