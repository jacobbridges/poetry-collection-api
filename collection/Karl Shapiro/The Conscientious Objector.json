    "The gates clanged and they walked you into jail",
    "More tense than felons but relieved to find",
    "The hostile world shut out, the flags that dripped",
    "From every mother\u2019s windowpane, obscene",
    "The bloodlust sweating from the public heart,",
    "The dog authority slavering at your throat.",
    "A sense of quiet, of pulling down the blind",
    "Possessed you. Punishment you felt was clean.",
    "The decks, the catwalks, and the narrow light",
    "Composed a ship. This was a mutinous crew",
    "Troubling the captains for plain decencies,",
    "A Mayflower brim with pilgrims headed out",
    "To establish new theocracies to west,",
    "A Noah\u2019s ark coasting the topmost seas",
    "Ten miles above the sodomites and fish.",
    "These inmates loved the only living doves.",
    "Like all men hunted from the world you made",
    "A good community, voyaging the storm",
    "To no safe Plymouth or green Ararat;",
    "Trouble or calm, the men with Bibles prayed,",
    "The gaunt politicals construed our hate.",
    "The opposite of all armies, you were best",
    "Opposing uniformity and yourselves;",
    "Prison and personality were your fate.",
    "You suffered not so physically but knew",
    "Maltreatment, hunger, ennui of the mind.",
    "Well might the soldier kissing the hot beach",
    "Erupting in his face damn all your kind.",
    "Yet you who saved neither yourselves nor us",
    "Are equally with those who shed the blood",
    "The heroes of our cause. Your conscience is",
    "What we come back to in the armistice."
