    "As a sloop with a sweep of immaculate wing on her delicate spine",
    "And a keel as steel as a root that holds in the sea as she leans,",
    "Leaning and laughing, my warm-hearted beauty, you ride, you ride,",
    "You tack on the curves with parabola speed and a kiss of goodbye,",
    "Like a thoroughbred sloop, my new high-spirited spirit, my kiss.",
    "As my foot suggests that you leap in the air with your hips of a girl,",
    "My finger that praises your wheel and announces your voices of song,",
    "Flouncing your skirts, you blueness of joy, you flirt of politeness,",
    "You leap, you intelligence, essence of wheelness with silvery nose,",
    "And your platinum clocks of excitement stir like the hairs of a fern.",
    "But how alien you are from the booming belts of your birth and the smoke",
    "Where you turned on the stinging lathes of Detroit and Lansing at night",
    "And shrieked at the torch in your secret parts and the amorous tests,",
    "But now with your eyes that enter the future of roads you forget;",
    "You are all instinct with your phosphorous glow and your streaking hair.",
    "And now when we stop it is not as the bird from the shell that I leave",
    "Or the leathery pilot who steps from his bird with a sneer of delight,",
    "And not as the ignorant beast do you squat and watch me depart,",
    "But with exquisite breathing you smile, with satisfaction of love,",
    "And I touch you again as you tick in the silence and settle in sleep."
