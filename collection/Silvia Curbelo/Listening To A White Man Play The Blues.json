    "All night my wife looks down",
    "the neck of my guitar",
    "passing the bottle back and forth",
    "like a story she's been telling for years.",
    "So many baskets of hard bread.",
    "You take the shovel to the ground.",
    "The land stares back at you.",
    "The corn drifts towards the sky.",
    "You don't know what dirt is",
    "until you bury your first daughter."
