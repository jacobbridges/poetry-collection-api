    "Some dreams are like glass",

    "A girl weeps in a garden.",
    "A woman turns her head and that is all.",
    "We wake up a hundred times and",
    "don't know where we are. Asleep",
    "at the wheel. Saved by",
    "the luck of angels.",
    "Everyone touching his lips",
    "to something larger, the watermark",
    "of some great sorrow. Everyone",
    "giving himself away. The way",
    "the rose gives up the stem and",
    "floats completely, without history.",
    "In the end every road leads",
    "to water. What is left of a garden",
    "is the dream, an alphabet of longing.",
    "The shadow of the girl. Perfume."
