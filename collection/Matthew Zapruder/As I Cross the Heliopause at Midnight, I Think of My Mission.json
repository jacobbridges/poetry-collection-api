    "Drunker than Voyager I",
    "but not as Voyager 2 I rode my blue",
    "bike back through the darkness",
    "to my lonely geode cave of light",
    "awaiting nothing under the punctured",
    "dome. I had achieved escape",
    "velocity drinking clear liquid starlight",
    "at the Thunderbird with a fingerless",
    "Russian hedge fund inspector and one",
    "who called himself The Champ. All",
    "night I felt fine crystals cutting",
    "my lips like rising up through",
    "a hailstorm. And the great vacuum",
    "cleaner that cannot be filled moved",
    "through my chest, gathering",
    "conversation dust and discharging",
    "it through my borehole. During",
    "one of many silences The Champ",
    "took off his face and thus were many",
    "gears to much metallic laughter",
    "revealed. Long ago I forgot",
    "the word which used to mean in truth",
    "but now expresses disbelief. So",
    "quickly did my future come. You who",
    "are floating past me on your inward way,",
    "please inform those glowing faces",
    "who first gave me this shove I have",
    "managed to rotate my brilliant",
    "golden array despite their instructions."
