    "Oh this Diet Coke is really good,",
    "though come to think of it it tastes",
    "like nothing plus the idea of chocolate,",
    "or an acquaintance of chocolate",
    "speaking fondly of certain times",
    "it and chocolate had spoken of nothing,",
    "or nothing remembering a field",
    "in which it once ate the most wondrous",
    "sandwich of ham and rustic chambered cheese",
    "yet still wished for a piece of chocolate",
    "before the lone walk back through",
    "the corn then the darkening forest",
    "to the disappointing village and its super",
    "creepy bed and breakfast. With secret despair",
    "I returned to the city. Something",
    "seemed to be waiting for me.",
    "Maybe the \u201cchosen guide\u201d Wordsworth",
    "wrote he would even were it \u201cnothing",
    "better than a wandering cloud\u201d",
    "have followed which of course to me",
    "and everyone sounds amazing.",
    "All I follow is my own desire,",
    "sometimes to feel, sometimes to be",
    "at least a little more than intermittently",
    "at ease with being loved. I am never",
    "at ease. Not with hours I can read or walk",
    "and look at the brightly colored",
    "houses filled with lives, not with night",
    "when I lie on my back and listen,",
    "not with the hallway, definitely",
    "not with baseball, definitely",
    "not with time. Poor Coleridge, son",
    "of a Vicar and a lake, he could not feel",
    "the energy. No present joy, no cheerful",
    "confidence, just love of friends and the wind",
    "taking his arrow away. Come to the edge",
    "the edge beckoned softly. Take",
    "this cup full of darkness and stay as long",
    "as you want and maybe a little longer."
