    "Today in El Paso all the planes are asleep on the runway. The world",
    "is in a delay. All the political consultants drinking whiskey keep",
    "their heads down, lifting them only to look at the beautiful scarred",
    "waitress who wears typewriter keys as a necklace. They jingle",
    "when she brings them drinks. Outside the giant plate glass windows",
    "the planes are completely covered in snow, it piles up on the wings.",
    "I feel like a mountain of cell phone chargers. Each of the various",
    "faiths of our various fathers keeps us only partly protected. I don\u2019t",
    "want to talk on the phone to an angel. At night before I go to sleep",
    "I am already dreaming. Of coffee, of ancient generals, of the faces",
    "of statues each of which has the eternal expression of one of my feelings.",
    "I examine my feelings without feeling anything. I ride my blue bike",
    "on the edge of the desert. I am president of this glass of water."
