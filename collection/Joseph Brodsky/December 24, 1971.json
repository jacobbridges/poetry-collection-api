    "When it\u2019s Christmas we\u2019re all of us magi.",
    "At the grocers\u2019 all slipping and pushing.",
    "Where a tin of halvah, coffee-flavored,",
    "is the cause of a human assault-wave",
    "by a crowd heavy-laden with parcels:",
    "each one his own king, his own camel.",
    "Nylon bags, carrier bags, paper cones,",
    "caps and neckties all twisted up sideways.",
    "Reek of vodka and resin and cod,",
    "orange mandarins, cinnamon, apples.",
    "Floods of faces, no sign of a pathway",
    "toward Bethlehem, shut off by blizzard.",
    "And the bearers of moderate gifts",
    "leap on buses and jam all the doorways,",
    "disappear into courtyards that gape,",
    "though they know that there\u2019s nothing inside there:",
    "not a beast, not a crib, nor yet her,",
    "round whose head gleams a nimbus of gold.",
    "Emptiness. But the mere thought of that",
    "brings forth lights as if out of nowhere.",
    "Herod reigns but the stronger he is,",
    "the more sure, the more certain the wonder.",
    "In the constancy of this relation",
    "is the basic mechanics of Christmas.",
    "That\u2019s what they celebrate everywhere,",
    "for its coming push tables together.",
    "No demand for a star for a while,",
    "but a sort of good will touched with grace",
    "can be seen in all men from afar,",
    "and the shepherds have kindled their fires.",
    "Snow is falling: not smoking but sounding",
    "chimney pots on the roof, every face like a stain.",
    "Herod drinks. Every wife hides her child.",
    "He who comes is a mystery: features",
    "are not known beforehand, men\u2019s hearts may",
    "not be quick to distinguish the stranger.",
    "But when drafts through the doorway disperse",
    "the thick mist of the hours of darkness",
    "and a shape in a shawl stands revealed,",
    "both a newborn and Spirit that\u2019s Holy",
    "in your self you discover; you stare",
    "skyward, and it\u2019s right there:",
    "a star."
