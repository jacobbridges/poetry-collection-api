    "Since the stern art of poetry calls for words, I, morose,",
    "deaf, and balding ambassador of a more or less",
    "insignificant nation that\u2019s stuck in this super",
    "power, wishing to spare my old brain,",
    "hand myself my own topcoat and head for the main",
    "street: to purchase the evening paper.",
    "Wind disperses the foliage. The dimness of old bulbs in these",
    "sorry quarters, whose motto\u2019s \u201cThe mirror will please,\u201d",
    "gives a sense of abundance supported by puddles.",
    "Even thieves here steal apples by scratching the amalgam first.",
    "Yet the feeling one gets, from one\u2019s own sweet reflection\u2014this feeling I\u2019ve",
    "lost.",
    "That\u2019s what really puzzles.",
    "Everything in these parts is geared for winter: long dreams,",
    "prison walls, overcoats, bridal dresses of whiteness that seems",
    "snowlike. Drinks. Kinds of soap matching dirt in dark corners.",
    "Sparrow vests, second hand of the watch round your wrist,",
    "puritanical mores, underwear. And, tucked in the violinists\u2019",
    "palms, old redwood hand warmers.",
    "This whole realm is just static. Imagining the output of lead",
    "and cast iron, and shaking your stupefied head,",
    "you recall bayonets, Cossack whips of old power.",
    "Yet the eagles land like good lodestones on the scraps.",
    "Even wicker chairs here are built mostly with bolts and with nuts,",
    "one is bound to discover.",
    "Only fish in the sea seem to know freedom\u2019s price.",
    "Still, their muteness compels us to sit and devise",
    "cashier booths of our own. And space rises like some bill of fare.",
    "Time\u2019s invented by death. In its search for the objects, it deals",
    "with raw vegetables first That\u2019s why cocks are so keen on the bells",
    "chiming deafly somewhere.",
    "To exist in the Era of Deeds and to stay elevated, alert",
    "ain\u2019t so easy, alas. Having raised a long skirt,",
    "you will find not new wonders but what you expected.",
    "And it\u2019s not that they play Lobachevsky\u2019s ideas by ear,",
    "but the widened horizons should narrow somewhere, and here\u2014",
    "here\u2019s the end of perspective.",
    "Either old Europe\u2019s map has been swiped by the gents in plain clothes,",
    "or the famous five-sixths of remaining landmass has just lost",
    "its poor infamous colleague, or a fairy casts spells over shabby",
    "me, who knows\u2014but I cannot escape from this place;",
    "I pour wine for myself (service here\u2019s a disgrace),",
    "sip, and rub my old tabby.",
    "Thus the brain earned a slug, as a spot where an error occurred",
    "earns a good pointing finger. Or should I hit waterways, sort",
    "of like Christ? Anyway, in these laudable quarters,",
    "eyes dumbfounded by ice and by booze",
    "will reproach you alike for whatever you choose:",
    "traceless rails, traceless waters.",
    "Now let\u2019s see what they say in the papers about lawsuits.",
    "\u201cThe condemned has been dealt with.\u201d Having read this, a denizen puts",
    "on his metal-rimmed glasses that help to relate it",
    "to a man lying flat, his face down, by the wall;",
    "though he isn\u2019t asleep. Since dreams spurn a skull",
    "that has been perforated.",
    "The keen-sightedness of our era takes root in the times",
    "which were short, in their blindness, of drawing clear lines",
    "twixt those fallen from cradles and fallen from saddles.",
    "Though there are plenty of saucers, there is no one to turn tables with",
    "to subject you, poor Rurik, to a sensible quiz;",
    "that\u2019s what really saddens.",
    "The keen-sightedness of our days is the sort that befits the dead end",
    "whose concrete begs for spittle and not for a witty comment.",
    "Wake up a dinosaur, not a prince, to recite you the moral!",
    "Birds have feathers for penning last words, though it\u2019s better to ask.",
    "All the innocent head has in store for itself is an ax",
    "plus the evergreen laurel.",
