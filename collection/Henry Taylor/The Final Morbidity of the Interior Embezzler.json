    "I've made a little sluice-gate in the flow",
    "of cash across the spreadsheet on my screen.",
    "Amid torrential chaos and foreseen",
    "disasters it maintains its small and slow",
    "on-off diversions, so my work can show",
    "the delicacy of difference between",
    "the beans I count and one uncounted bean,",
    "and where the latter might invisibly go.",
    "The hollowed shoe-tree, the hermetic jar",
    "are gadgetry I might revert to yet.",
    "There is the money of the thing, the far",
    "secure retirement years, the deep-hedged bet,",
    "but I love working where the unknowns are,",
    "and writing down what I need to forget."
