    "The clouds as I see them, rising",
    "urgently, roseate in the",
    "mounting of somber power",
    "surging in evening haste over",
    "roofs and hermetic",
    "grim walls\u2014",
    "Last night",
    "as if death had lit a pale light",
    "in your flesh, your flesh",
    "was cold to my touch, or not cold",
    "but cool, cooling, as if the last traces",
    "of warmth were still fading in you.",
    "My thigh burned in cold fear where",
    "yours touched it.",
    "But I forced to mind my vision of a sky",
    "close and enclosed, unlike the space in which these clouds move\u2014",
    "a sky of gray mist it appeared\u2014",
    "and how looking intently at it we saw",
    "its gray was not gray but a milky white",
    "in which radiant traces of opal greens,",
    "fiery blues, gleamed, faded, gleamed again,",
    "and how only then, seeing the color in the gray,",
    "a field sprang into sight, extending",
    "between where we stood and the horizon,",
    "a field of freshest deep spiring grass",
    "starred with dandelions,",
    "green and gold",
    "gold and green alternating in closewoven",
    "chords, madrigal field.",
    "Is death\u2019s chill that visited our bed",
    "other than what it seemed, is it",
    "a gray to be watched keenly?",
    "Wiping my glasses and leaning westward,",
    "clearing my mind of the day\u2019s mist and leaning",
    "into myself to see",
    "the colors of truth",
    "I watch the clouds as I see them",
    "in pomp advancing, pursuing",
    "the fallen sun."
