    "All others talked as if",
    "talk were a dance.",
    "Clodhopper I, with clumsy feet",
    "would break the gliding ring.",
    "Early I learned to",
    "hunch myself",
    "close by the door:",
    "then when the talk began",
    "I\u2019d wipe my",
    "mouth and wend",
    "unnoticed back to the barn",
    "to be with the warm beasts,",
    "dumb among body sounds",
    "of the simple ones.",
    "I\u2019d see by a twist",
    "of lit rush the motes",
    "of gold moving",
    "from shadow to shadow",
    "slow in the wake",
    "of deep untroubled sighs.",
    "The cows",
    "munched or stirred or were still. I",
    "was at home and lonely,",
    "both in good measure. Until",
    "the sudden angel affrighted me\u2014light effacing",
    "my feeble beam,",
    "a forest of torches, feathers of flame, sparks upflying:",
    "but the cows as before",
    "were calm, and nothing was burning,",
    "nothing but I, as that hand of fire",
    "touched my lips and scorched my tongue",
    "and pulled my voice",
    "into the ring of the dance."
