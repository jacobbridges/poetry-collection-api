    "I like to find",
    "what's not found",
    "at once, but lies",
    "within something of another nature,",
    "in repose, distinct.",
    "Gull feathers of glass, hidden",
    "in white pulp: the bones of squid",
    "which I pull out and lay",
    "blade by blade on the draining board\u2014",
    "tapered as if for swiftness, to pierce",
    "the heart, but fragile, substance",
    "belying design. Or a fruit,",
    ",",
    "cased in rough brown peel, the flesh",
    "rose-amber, and the seed:",
    "the seed a stone of wood, carved and",
    "polished, walnut-colored, formed",
    "like a brazilnut, but large,",
    "large enough to fill",
    "the hungry palm of a hand.",
    "I like the juicy stem of grass that grows",
    "within the coarser leaf folded round,",
    "and the butteryellow glow",
    "in the narrow flute from which the morning-glory",
    "opens blue and cool on a hot morning."
