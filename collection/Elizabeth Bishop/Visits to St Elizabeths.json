    "This is the house of Bedlam.",
    "This is the man",
    "that lies in the house of Bedlam.",
    "This is the time",
    "of the tragic man",
    "that lies in the house of Bedlam.",
    "This is a wristwatch",
    "telling the time",
    "of the talkative man",
    "that lies in the house of Bedlam.",
    "This is a sailor",
    "wearing the watch",
    "that tells the time",
    "of the honored man",
    "that lies in the house of Bedlam.",
    "This is the roadstead all of board",
    "reached by the sailor",
    "wearing the watch",
    "that tells the time",
    "of the old, brave man",
    "that lies in the house of Bedlam.",
    "These are the years and the walls of the ward,",
    "the winds and clouds of the sea of board",
    "sailed by the sailor",
    "wearing the watch",
    "that tells the time",
    "of the cranky man",
    "that lies in the house of Bedlam.",
    "This is a Jew in a newspaper hat",
    "that dances weeping down the ward",
    "over the creaking sea of board",
    "beyond the sailor",
    "winding his watch",
    "that tells the time",
    "of the cruel man",
    "that lies in the house of Bedlam.",
    "This is a world of books gone flat.",
    "This is a Jew in a newspaper hat",
    "that dances weeping down the ward",
    "over the creaking sea of board",
    "of the batty sailor",
    "that winds his watch",
    "that tells the time",
    "of the busy man",
    "that lies in the house of Bedlam.",
    "This is a boy that pats the floor",
    "to see if the world is there, is flat,",
    "for the widowed Jew in the newspaper hat",
    "that dances weeping down the ward",
    "waltzing the length of a weaving board",
    "by the silent sailor",
    "that hears his watch",
    "that ticks the time",
    "of the tedious man",
    "that lies in the house of Bedlam.",
    "These are the years and the walls and the door",
    "that shut on a boy that pats the floor",
    "to feel if the world is there and flat.",
    "This is a Jew in a newspaper hat",
    "that dances joyfully down the ward",
    "into the parting seas of board",
    "past the staring sailor",
    "that shakes his watch",
    "that tells the time",
    "of the poet, the man",
    "that lies in the house of Bedlam.",
    "This is the soldier home from the war.",
    "These are the years and the walls and the door",
    "that shut on a boy that pats the floor",
    "to see if the world is round or flat.",
    "This is a Jew in a newspaper hat",
    "that dances carefully down the ward,",
    "walking the plank of a coffin board",
    "with the crazy sailor",
    "that shows his watch",
    "that tells the time",
    "of the wretched man",
    "that lies in the house of Bedlam."
