    "At four o\u2019clock",
    "in the gun-metal blue dark",
    "we hear the first crow of the first cock",
    "just below",
    "the gun-metal blue window",
    "and immediately there is an echo",
    "off in the distance,",
    "then one from the backyard fence,",
    "then one, with horrible insistence,",
    "grates like a wet match",
    "from the broccoli patch,",
    "flares, and all over town begins to catch.",
    "Cries galore",
    "come from the water-closet door,",
    "from the dropping-plastered henhouse floor,",
    "where in the blue blur",
    "their rustling wives admire,",
    "the roosters brace their cruel feet and glare",
    "with stupid eyes",
    "while from their beaks there rise",
    "the uncontrolled, traditional cries.",
    "Deep from protruding chests",
    "in green-gold medals dressed,",
    "planned to command and terrorize the rest,",
    "the many wives",
    "who lead hens\u2019 lives",
    "of being courted and despised;",
    "deep from raw throats",
    "a senseless order floats",
    "all over town. A rooster gloats",
    "over our beds",
    "from rusty iron sheds",
    "and fences made from old bedsteads,",
    "over our churches",
    "where the tin rooster perches,",
    "over our little wooden northern houses,",
    "making sallies",
    "from all the muddy alleys,",
    "marking out maps like Rand McNally\u2019s:",
    "glass-headed pins,",
    "oil-golds and copper greens,",
    "anthracite blues, alizarins,",
    "each one an active",
    "displacement in perspective;",
    "each screaming, \u201cThis is where I live!\u201d",
    "Each screaming",
    "\u201cGet up! Stop dreaming!\u201d",
    "Roosters, what are you projecting?",
    "You, whom the Greeks elected",
    "to shoot at on a post, who struggled",
    "when sacrificed, you whom they labeled",
    "\u201cVery combative ...\u201d",
    "what right have you to give",
    "commands and tell us how to live,",
    "cry \u201cHere!\u201d and \u201cHere!\u201d",
    "and wake us here where are",
    "unwanted love, conceit and war?",
    "The crown of red",
    "set on your little head",
    "is charged with all your fighting blood.",
    "Yes, that excrescence",
    "makes a most virile presence,",
    "plus all that vulgar beauty of iridescence.",
    "Now in mid-air",
    "by twos they fight each other.",
    "Down comes a first flame-feather,",
    "and one is flying,",
    "with raging heroism defying",
    "even the sensation of dying.",
    "And one has fallen,",
    "but still above the town",
    "his torn-out, bloodied feathers drift down;",
    "and what he sung",
    "no matter. He is flung",
    "on the gray ash-heap, lies in dung",
    "with his dead wives",
    "with open, bloody eyes,",
    "while those metallic feathers oxidize.",
    "St. Peter\u2019s sin",
    "was worse than that of Magdalen",
    "whose sin was of the flesh alone;",
    "of spirit, Peter\u2019s,",
    "falling, beneath the flares,",
    "among the \u201cservants and officers.\u201d",
    "Old holy sculpture",
    "could set it all together",
    "in one small scene, past and future:",
    "Christ stands amazed,",
    "Peter, two fingers raised",
    "to surprised lips, both as if dazed.",
    "But in between",
    "a little cock is seen",
    "carved on a dim column in the travertine,",
    "explained by",
    "underneath it.",
    "There is inescapable hope, the pivot;",
    "yes, and there Peter\u2019s tears",
    "run down our chanticleer\u2019s",
    "sides and gem his spurs.",
    "Tear-encrusted thick",
    "as a medieval relic",
    "he waits. Poor Peter, heart-sick,",
    "still cannot guess",
    "those cock-a-doodles yet might bless,",
    "his dreadful rooster come to mean forgiveness,",
    "a new weathervane",
    "on basilica and barn,",
    "and that outside the Lateran",
    "there would always be",
    "a bronze cock on a porphyry",
    "pillar so the people and the Pope might see",
    "that even the Prince",
    "of the Apostles long since",
    "had been forgiven, and to convince",
    "all the assembly",
    "that \u201cDeny deny deny\u201d",
    "is not all the roosters cry.",
    "In the morning",
    "a low light is floating",
    "in the backyard, and gilding",
    "from underneath",
    "the broccoli, leaf by leaf;",
    "how could the night have come to grief?",
    "gilding the tiny",
    "floating swallow\u2019s belly",
    "and lines of pink cloud in the sky,",
    "the day\u2019s preamble",
    "like wandering lines in marble.",
    "The cocks are now almost inaudible.",
    "The sun climbs in,",
    "following \u201cto see the end,\u201d",
    "faithful as enemy, or friend."
