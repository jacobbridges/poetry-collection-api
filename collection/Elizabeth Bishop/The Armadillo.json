    "This is the time of year",
    "when almost every night",
    "the frail, illegal fire balloons appear.",
    "Climbing the mountain height,",
    "rising toward a saint",
    "still honored in these parts,",
    "the paper chambers flush and fill with light",
    "that comes and goes, like hearts.",
    "Once up against the sky it's hard",
    "to tell them from the stars\u2014",
    "planets, that is\u2014the tinted ones:",
    "Venus going down, or Mars,",
    "or the pale green one. With a wind,",
    "they flare and falter, wobble and toss;",
    "but if it's still they steer between",
    "the kite sticks of the Southern Cross,",
    "receding, dwindling, solemnly",
    "and steadily forsaking us,",
    "or, in the downdraft from a peak,",
    "suddenly turning dangerous.",
    "Last night another big one fell.",
    "It splattered like an egg of fire",
    "against the cliff behind the house.",
    "The flame ran down. We saw the pair",
    "of owls who nest there flying up",
    "and up, their whirling black-and-white",
    "stained bright pink underneath, until",
    "they shrieked up out of sight.",
    "The ancient owls' nest must have burned.",
    "Hastily, all alone,",
    "a glistening armadillo left the scene,",
    "rose-flecked, head down, tail down,",
    "and then a baby rabbit jumped out,",
    "-eared, to our surprise.",
    "So soft!\u2014a handful of intangible ash",
    "with fixed, ignited eyes."
