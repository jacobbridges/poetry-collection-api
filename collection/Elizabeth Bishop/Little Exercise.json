    "Think of the storm roaming the sky uneasily",
    "like a dog looking for a place to sleep in,",
    "listen to it growling.",
    "Think how they must look now, the mangrove keys",
    "lying out there unresponsive to the lightning",
    "in dark, coarse-fibred families,",
    "where occasionally a heron may undo his head,",
    "shake up his feathers, make an uncertain comment",
    "when the surrounding water shines.",
    "Think of the boulevard and the little palm trees",
    "all stuck in rows, suddenly revealed",
    "as fistfuls of limp fish-skeletons.",
    "It is raining there. The boulevard",
    "and its broken sidewalks with weeds in every crack",
    "are relieved to be wet, the sea to be freshened.",
    "Now the storm goes away again in a series",
    "of small, badly lit battle-scenes,",
    "each in \"Another part of the field.\"",
    "Think of someone sleeping in the bottom of a row-boat",
    "tied to a mangrove root or the pile of a bridge;",
    "think of him as uninjured, barely disturbed."
