    "A new volcano has erupted,",
    "the papers say, and last week I was reading",
    "where some ship saw an island being born:",
    "at first a breath of steam, ten miles away;",
    "and then a black fleck\u2014basalt, probably\u2014",
    "rose in the mate\u2019s binoculars",
    "and caught on the horizon like a fly.",
    "They named it. But my poor old island\u2019s still",
    "un-rediscovered, un-renamable.",
    "None of the books has ever got it right.",
    "Well, I had fifty-two",
    "miserable, small volcanoes I could climb",
    "with a few slithery strides\u2014",
    "volcanoes dead as ash heaps.",
    "I used to sit on the edge of the highest one",
    "and count the others standing up,",
    "naked and leaden, with their heads blown off.",
    "I\u2019d think that if they were the size",
    "I thought volcanoes should be, then I had",
    "become a giant;",
    "and if I had become a giant,",
    "I couldn\u2019t bear to think what size",
    "the goats and turtles were,",
    "or the gulls, or the overlapping rollers",
    "\u2014a glittering hexagon of rollers",
    "closing and closing in, but never quite,",
    "glittering and glittering, though the sky",
    "was mostly overcast.",
    "My island seemed to be",
    "a sort of cloud-dump. All the hemisphere\u2019s",
    "left-over clouds arrived and hung",
    "above the craters\u2014their parched throats",
    "were hot to touch.",
    "Was that why it rained so much?",
    "And why sometimes the whole place hissed?",
    "The turtles lumbered by, high-domed,",
    "hissing like teakettles.",
    "(And I\u2019d have given years, or taken a few,",
    "for any sort of kettle, of course.)",
    "The folds of lava, running out to sea,",
    "would hiss. I\u2019d turn. And then they\u2019d prove",
    "to be more turtles.",
    "The beaches were all lava, variegated,",
    "black, red, and white, and gray;",
    "the marbled colors made a fine display.",
    "And I had waterspouts. Oh,",
    "half a dozen at a time, far out,",
    "they\u2019d come and go, advancing and retreating,",
    "their heads in cloud, their feet in moving patches",
    "of scuffed-up white.",
    "Glass chimneys, flexible, attenuated,",
    "sacerdotal beings of glass ... I watched",
    "the water spiral up in them like smoke.",
    "Beautiful, yes, but not much company.",
    "I often gave way to self-pity.",
    "\u201cDo I deserve this? I suppose I must.",
    "I wouldn\u2019t be here otherwise. Was there",
    "a moment when I actually chose this?",
    "I don\u2019t remember, but there could have been.\u201d",
    "What\u2019s wrong about self-pity, anyway?",
    "With my legs dangling down familiarly",
    "over a crater\u2019s edge, I told myself",
    "\u201cPity should begin at home.\u201d So the more",
    "pity I felt, the more I felt at home.",
    "The sun set in the sea; the same odd sun",
    "rose from the sea,",
    "and there was one of it and one of me.",
    "The island had one kind of everything:",
    "one tree snail, a bright violet-blue",
    "with a thin shell, crept over everything,",
    "over the one variety of tree,",
    "a sooty, scrub affair.",
    "Snail shells lay under these in drifts",
    "and, at a distance,",
    "you\u2019d swear that they were beds of irises.",
    "There was one kind of berry, a dark red.",
    "I tried it, one by one, and hours apart.",
    "Sub-acid, and not bad, no ill effects;",
    "and so I made home-brew. I\u2019d drink",
    "the awful, fizzy, stinging stuff",
    "that went straight to my head",
    "and play my home-made flute",
    "(I think it had the weirdest scale on earth)",
    "and, dizzy, whoop and dance among the goats.",
    "Home-made, home-made! But aren\u2019t we all?",
    "I felt a deep affection for",
    "the smallest of my island industries.",
    "No, not exactly, since the smallest was",
    "a miserable philosophy.",
    "Because I didn\u2019t know enough.",
    "Why didn\u2019t I know enough of something?",
    "Greek drama or astronomy? The books",
    "I\u2019d read were full of blanks;",
    "the poems\u2014well, I tried",
    "reciting to my iris-beds,",
    "\u201cThey flash upon that inward eye,",
    "which is the bliss ...\u201d The bliss of what?",
    "One of the first things that I did",
    "when I got back was look it up.",
    "The island smelled of goat and guano.",
    "The goats were white, so were the gulls,",
    "and both too tame, or else they thought",
    "I was a goat, too, or a gull.",
    "and",
    "baa ... shriek ...",
    "I still can\u2019t shake",
    "them from my ears; they\u2019re hurting now.",
    "The questioning shrieks, the equivocal replies",
    "over a ground of hissing rain",
    "and hissing, ambulating turtles",
    "got on my nerves.",
    "When all the gulls flew up at once, they sounded",
    "like a big tree in a strong wind, its leaves.",
    "I\u2019d shut my eyes and think about a tree,",
    "an oak, say, with real shade, somewhere.",
    "I\u2019d heard of cattle getting island-sick.",
    "I thought the goats were.",
    "One billy-goat would stand on the volcano",
    "I\u2019d christened",
    "or",
    "(I\u2019d time enough to play with names),",
    "and bleat and bleat, and sniff the air.",
    "I\u2019d grab his beard and look at him.",
    "His pupils, horizontal, narrowed up",
    "and expressed nothing, or a little malice.",
    "I got so tired of the very colors!",
    "One day I dyed a baby goat bright red",
    "with my red berries, just to see",
    "something a little different.",
    "And then his mother wouldn\u2019t recognize him.",
    "Dreams were the worst. Of course I dreamed of food",
    "and love, but they were pleasant rather",
    "than otherwise. But then I\u2019d dream of things",
    "like slitting a baby\u2019s throat, mistaking it",
    "for a baby goat. I\u2019d have",
    "nightmares of other islands",
    "stretching away from mine, infinities",
    "of islands, islands spawning islands,",
    "like frogs\u2019 eggs turning into polliwogs",
    "of islands, knowing that I had to live",
    "on each and every one, eventually,",
    "for ages, registering their flora,",
    "their fauna, their geography.",
    "Just when I thought I couldn\u2019t stand it",
    "another minute longer, Friday came.",
    "(Accounts of that have everything all wrong.)",
    "Friday was nice.",
    "Friday was nice, and we were friends.",
    "If only he had been a woman!",
    "I wanted to propagate my kind,",
    "and so did he, I think, poor boy.",
    "He\u2019d pet the baby goats sometimes,",
    "and race with them, or carry one around.",
    "\u2014Pretty to watch; he had a pretty body.",
    "And then one day they came and took us off.",
    "Now I live here, another island,",
    "that doesn\u2019t seem like one, but who decides?",
    "My blood was full of them; my brain",
    "bred islands. But that archipelago",
    "has petered out. I\u2019m old.",
    "I\u2019m bored, too, drinking my real tea,",
    "surrounded by uninteresting lumber.",
    "The knife there on the shelf\u2014",
    "it reeked of meaning, like a crucifix.",
    "It lived. How many years did I",
    "beg it, implore it, not to break?",
    "I knew each nick and scratch by heart,",
    "the bluish blade, the broken tip,",
    "the lines of wood-grain on the handle ...",
    "Now it won\u2019t look at me at all.",
    "The living soul has dribbled away.",
    "My eyes rest on it and pass on.",
    "The local museum\u2019s asked me to",
    "leave everything to them:",
    "the flute, the knife, the shrivelled shoes,",
    "my shedding goatskin trousers",
    "(moths have got in the fur),",
    "the parasol that took me such a time",
    "remembering the way the ribs should go.",
    "It still will work but, folded up,",
    "looks like a plucked and skinny fowl.",
    "How can anyone want such things?",
    "\u2014And Friday, my dear Friday, died of measles",
    "seventeen years ago come March."
