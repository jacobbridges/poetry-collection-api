    "I kept a letter from my hometown in Lithuania, from one",
    "who still holds a dominion somewhere with her youthful charm.",
    "In it she placed her sorrow and her affection:",
    "A blade of grass from Ponar.",
    "This blade of grass with a flickering puff of dying cloud",
    "ignited, letter by letter, the faces of the letters.",
    "And over letter-faces in murmuring smolder:",
    "The blade of grass from Ponar.",
    "This blade of grass is now my world, my miniature home,",
    "where children play the fiddle in a line on fire.",
    "They play the fiddle and legendary is their conductor:",
    "The blade of grass from Ponar.",
    "I will not separate from my hometown\u2019s blade of grass.",
    "My good, longed-for earth will make room for both.",
    "And then I will bring a gift to the Lord:",
    "The blade of grass from Ponar."
