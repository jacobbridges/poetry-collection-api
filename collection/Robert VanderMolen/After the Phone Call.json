    "She looked nearly the same",
    "But when I hugged her",
    "There was substantially more",
    "To her\u2014no doubt as with me.",
    "She fibbed as I did at the edge",
    "Of curb under the streetlight",
    "As spiders dropped like tiny",
    "Parachutes\u2014they were difficult",
    "To see. On the periphery",
    "Of good luck, I thought,",
    "Revisiting her quirky habits",
    "And expressions, what I eventually",
    "Found so bothersome. Except",
    "When I glanced at my watch",
    "I discovered I was trembling",
    "Like a small-time embezzler.",
    "I see, she said, you must have",
    "An appointment. The driveways",
    "And hedges funneling back",
    "Into darkness, into someone else's",
    "Childhood, where speech was",
    "An obstacle. Wild turkeys",
    "Approaching across the lawn.",
    "Oh no, I said, I'm just so pleased",
    "To see you. But that didn't",
    "Make sense either. She cocked",
    "Her head, a woman with grown",
    "Twins and three conniving husbands.",
    "Even my toes felt damp. I remember,",
    "She said, when you'd lay your head",
    "On my lap, I'd stroke your hair\u2014",
    "I didn't recall. Though I thought",
    "That would be a good idea now.",
    "But I'm married, I said. I own",
    "My own business. It would have",
    "Been helpful if I'd planned",
    "Some banter. I'm a high school",
    "Principal, she told me,",
    "I don't put up with horseshit",
    "From anyone. I brushed the arm",
    "Of her jacket\u2014she merely stared.",
    "A door slammed. A grown idiot",
    "Drooled in an attic somewhere down",
    "The lane. I had another image",
    "As well, one that held an odor",
    "Of patchouli oil. As she stepped",
    "Forward without caution, placed a hand",
    "On my neck. Take me, she insisted,",
    "To those rivets of flame following",
    "Wire\u2014because this is it,",
    "You'll never have another",
    "Hour. I immediately felt",
    "Calmer..."
