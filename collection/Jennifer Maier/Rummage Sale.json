    "Forgive me, Aunt Phyllis, for rejecting the cut",
    "glass dishes\u2014the odd set you gathered piece",
    "by piece from thirteen boxes of Lux laundry soap.",
    "Pardon me, eggbeater, for preferring the whisk;",
    "and you, small ship in a bottle, for the diminutive",
    "size of your ocean. Please don\u2019t tell my mother,",
    "hideous lamp, that the light you provided",
    "was never enough. Domestic deities, do not be angry",
    "that my counters are not white with flour;",
    "no one is sorrier than I, iron skillet, for the heavy",
    "longing for lightness directing my mortal hand.",
    "And my apologies, to you, above all,",
    "forsaken dresses, that sway from a rod between",
    "ladders behind me, clicking your plastic tongues",
    "at the girl you once made beautiful,",
    "and the woman, with a hard heart and",
    "softening body, who stands in the driveway",
    "making change."
