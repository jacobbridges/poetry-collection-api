    "I cradled my newborn daughter",
    "and felt the heartbeat",
    "pull me out of shock.",
    "She didn\u2019t know",
    "what her hands were:",
    "she folded them. I asked her",
    "was there a place",
    "where there was no world.",
    "She didn\u2019t know",
    "what a voice was: her lips",
    "were the shape of a nipple.",
    "In the park the child says:",
    "watch me. It will not count",
    "unless you see. And she shows me",
    "the cartwheel, the skip, the tumble,",
    "the tricks performed at leisure in midair,",
    "each unknown until it is finished.",
    "At home she orders:",
    "see me eat. I watch her",
    "curl on herself, sleep;",
    "as I try to leave the dark room",
    "her dreaming voice commands me: watch.",
    "Always we passed the seesaw",
    "on the way to the swings",
    "but tonight I remember",
    "the principle of the lever,",
    "I sit the child at one end,",
    "I sit near the center,",
    "the fulcrum, at once she has power",
    "to lift me off the earth",
    "and keep me suspended",
    "by her tiny weight, she laughing,",
    "I stunned at the power of the formula."
