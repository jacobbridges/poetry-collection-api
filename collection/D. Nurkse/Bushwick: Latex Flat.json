    "Sadness of just-painted rooms.",
    "We clean our tools",
    "meticulously, as if currying horses:",
    "the little nervous sash brush",
    "to be combed and primped,",
    "the fat old four-inchers",
    "that lap up space",
    "to be wrapped and groomed,",
    "the ceiling rollers,",
    "the little pencils",
    "that cover nailheads",
    "with oak gloss,",
    "to be counted and packed:",
    "camped on our dropsheets",
    "we stare across gleaming floors",
    "at the door and beyond it",
    "the old city full of old rumors",
    "of conspiracies, gunshots, market crashes:",
    "with a little mallet",
    "we tap our lids closed,",
    "holding our breath, holding our lives",
    "in suspension for a moment:",
    "an extra drop will ruin everything."
