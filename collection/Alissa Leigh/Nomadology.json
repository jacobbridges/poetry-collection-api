    "In the beginning, a word,",
    ";",
    "then a plan and then the reasons,",
    "which I do not remember exactly.",
    "I remember clearly only the clothes",
    "we were given for the journey",
    "and the last, silent meal we ate.",
    "We left the place as lightly as we",
    "had come, so many years before.",
    "From a sunlit state of innocence",
    "where white sheets were hung",
    "to dry like clouds over paradise;",
    "from eucalyptus-scented earth,",
    "a red house with a yard swung",
    "between dreaming hills, pillaged",
    "by raccoons, framed with lilies",
    "like trumpets of the archangels,",
    "we moved: into history, a river",
    "slowed by many bends, a village",
    "of peacocks with a hundred eyes;",
    "a low house among fields, with",
    "an iron stove, a winter shrine;",
    "a fireplace blackened by time,",
    "the fragile bones of a sparrow",
    "frozen in the shape of its flight.",
    "When father played his trombone",
    "in the attic, schoolchildren tittered",
    "in the street. In the late afternoon,",
    "the cows assembled at the gate,",
    "witless, waiting for a farmer's son.",
    "Home, the children conjugated",
    "verbs, found variables and drew",
    "diagrams of the human heart.",
    "Evenings, the round kitchen table,",
    "lit by a low Dutch lamp, summoned",
    "poets, players, horsethieves, to glasses",
    "of",
    ". An incense of gossip rose",
    "slowly, blackening the walls. Outside,",
    "horses pawed the darkness, breathing",
    "delicate feathers of ice. We courted",
    "the favors of spiders, mice and moles.",
    "Our words grew small and porous as",
    "fossiled bones, our gestures groaned",
    "with the cold. The will-less world of",
    "water, wood and stone taught us when",
    "to yield. When it came time to move",
    "along again, we were four strangers",
    "waving at each other, in slow motion,",
    "across a deafening expanse of ocean."
