    "He was trying to teach me to economize with my language.",
    "he said, instead of",
    "and I thought, sad stuff; plays. Okay: born, rented room,",
    "to Dad & Mom business & bar, how could you not? Or thought,",
    "I cannot be your Lithuania nor her other Armenia,",
    "emptied into river if not skein-tangled senseless. He won\u2019t say her name",
    "and not a word of the thitherings. Only that she was lost. Don\u2019t speak",
    "the heavy hinges, the crushed-bud breaking of taste",
    "from language. That sort of excess has no place in the new economy.",
    "Strindberg gray, say, when one thinks only January, January, January.",
    "Of the Occurrence as recurrent. A single gunshot",
    "in Dempster\u2019s cistern, the echo chambers of sleep. The gray lot",
    "of days in low-light hospitals, Strindberg.",
    "I\u2019ll call him gray, his sitting heavy. And her so Strindberg with veil and rose,",
    "her poised in shadow at the door. Funereal nails sunk",
    "into knees would be dripping were they not so goddamn gray.",
    "Excess was for days when my mother sat turning grape leaves",
    "with three sets of pockets: Turkish, English, & Armenian, plus lemon to dry it all out.",
    "By ten, they\u2019d sewn up two; said one is more than enough.",
    "\u201cEnglish, only, Sanossian.",
    "You will speak what we speak.\u201d",
    "I don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to lose",
    "a language. Instead,",
    "Strindberg gray, I say, when I want to bring his lost girl back. Strindberg gray,",
    "though I cannot take from him January, July, or the months of coping between.",
    "When my mother leafs through me in her memory banks, bits of face are missing;",
    "sometimes I\u2019m limbless or smear. Gray even scentless, and still all Strindberg.",
    "I tell him, I raise her: be darlings and come scream with me",
    "from all the pockets sewn over. Maybe by late summer we\u2019ll be humming:",
    "Tennessee yellow; Tennessee, Tennessee."
