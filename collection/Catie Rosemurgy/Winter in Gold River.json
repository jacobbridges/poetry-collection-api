    "Pretty girl. The weather has knocked her down again",
    "and given her to the lake to wear as a skin.",
    "Why am I always being the weather?",
    "There were days in the winter",
    "when her smile was so lovely I felt",
    "the breathing of my own goodness,",
    "though it remained fetal and separate.",
    "I was a scavenger who survives",
    "with a sling and stones, but whose god",
    "nonetheless invents the first small bright bird.",
    "And it was like flight to bring food to her lips",
    "with a skeletal hand. But now she will always",
    "be naked and sad. She will be what happens",
    "to lake water that is loved and is also",
    "shallow enough. The thickening, the slowing,",
    "the black blood of it, the chest opened",
    "to reveal the inevitable heart attack.",
    "God, the silence of the chamber",
    "we watch from. What happens to water",
    "that isn\u2019t loved? It undergoes processes.",
    "It freezes beside traffic.",
    "But the reaching out to all sides at once,",
    "the wet closing of what was open?",
    "That is a beautiful woman.",
    "So of course I stand and stare, never able",
    "to pinpoint the exact moment I killed her."
