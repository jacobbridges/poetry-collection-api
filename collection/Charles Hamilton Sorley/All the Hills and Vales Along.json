    "All the hills and vales along",
    "Earth is bursting into song,",
    "And the singers are the chaps",
    "Who are going to die perhaps.",
    "O sing, marching men,",
    "Till the valleys ring again.",
    "Give your gladness to earth's keeping,",
    "So be glad, when you are sleeping.",
    "Cast away regret and rue,",
    "Think what you are marching to.",
    "Little live, great pass.",
    "Jesus Christ and Barabbas",
    "Were found the same day.",
    "This died, that went his way.",
    "So sing with joyful breath,",
    "For why, you are going to death.",
    "Teeming earth will surely store",
    "All the gladness that you pour.",
    "Earth that never doubts nor fears,",
    "Earth that knows of death, not tears,",
    "Earth that bore with joyful ease",
    "Hemlock for Socrates,",
    "Earth that blossomed and was glad",
    "\u2018Neath the cross that Christ had,",
    "Shall rejoice and blossom too",
    "When the bullet reaches you.",
    "Wherefore, men marching",
    "On the road to death, sing!",
    "Pour your gladness on earth's head,",
    "So be merry, so be dead.",
    "From the hills and valleys earth",
    "Shouts back the sound of mirth,",
    "Tramp of feet and lilt of song",
    "Ringing all the road along.",
    "All the music of their going,",
    "Ringing swinging glad song-throwing,",
    "Earth will echo still, when foot",
    "Lies numb and voice mute.",
    "On, marching men, on",
    "To the gates of death with song.",
    "Sow your gladness for earth's reaping,",
    "So you may be glad, though sleeping.",
    "Strew your gladness on earth's bed,",
    "So be merry, so be dead."
