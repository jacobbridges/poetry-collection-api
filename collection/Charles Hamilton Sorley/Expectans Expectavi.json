    "From morn to midnight, all day through,",
    "I laugh and play as others do,",
    "I sin and chatter, just the same",
    "As others with a different name.",
    "And all year long upon the stage",
    "I dance and tumble and do rage",
    "So vehemently, I scarcely see",
    "The inner and eternal me.",
    "I have a temple I do not",
    "Visit, a heart I have forgot,",
    "A self that I have never met,",
    "A secret shrine\u2014and yet, and yet",
    "This sanctuary of my soul",
    "Unwitting I keep white and whole,",
    "Unlatched and lit, if Thou should'st care",
    "To enter or to tarry there.",
    "With parted lips and outstretched hands",
    "And listening ears Thy servant stands,",
    "Call Thou early, call Thou late,",
    "To Thy great service dedicate."
