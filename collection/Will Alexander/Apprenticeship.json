    "Here I am",
    "posing in a mirror of scratch paper sonnets",
    "sonnets as rare",
    "as a live Aegean rhino",
    "absorbing the cracklings of my craft",
    "its riverine volcanoes",
    "its spectacular lightning peninsulas",
    "emitting plentiful creosote phantoms",
    "from an ironic blizzard of unsettled pleromas",
    "scouring through years of unrecognized pablums",
    "of constant arch-rivalry with extinction",
    "bringing up skulls of intensive discourse",
    "by the claws in one\u2019s mind",
    "which seem to burn with systemic reduction",
    "one then suffers poetic scorching by debris",
    "by inaugural timber which flashes",
    "by friction which flares up & harries",
    "by unrecognized moltens collapsing in glass",
    "of initial intuitive neglect",
    "as if one\u2019s fangs",
    "were fatally stifled by incipience",
    "by verbal range war didactics",
    "by territorial driftwood",
    "by sudden undemonstrative detractions",
    "awed",
    "by the diverse infernos of Trakl & Dante",
    "one\u2019s youngish body stands",
    "devoured by reverential print trails",
    "momentarily cancelled",
    "by the loss of blasphemous nerves & upheaval",
    "stung",
    "by demeaning neutralities",
    "ravaged",
    "by a blank Sumatran solar psychosis",
    "by a tasteless collision of rums in transition",
    "by a conspiracy of obscured fertility by hubris",
    "as one sucks in doubt from a wave of tumbling blister trees",
    "there exists irradiations flecked with a gambled synecdoche",
    "with indeterminate earthenware splinters",
    "taking up",
    "from aboriginal density",
    "a forge of Sumerian verbal signs",
    "cooked with a tendency",
    "towards starfish hypnosis",
    "towards psychic confrontational drainage",
    "conducting one\u2019s frictions in a torrential furnace of osmosis & ire",
    "yes",
    "apprenticeship",
    "means poetry scrawled in unremitting leper\u2019s mosaic",
    "cringed in smoky interior cubicles",
    "releasing various deleriums",
    "as if pointed under a blackened Oedipal star",
    "with its dark incapable tints",
    "with its musical ruse of unspoken belladonna",
    "poetics",
    "an imaginal flash of Russian chamber lilies",
    "stretching under a blue marsupial sun",
    "like kaleidoscopic tumbleweed",
    "fugaciously transfixed",
    "upon an anomalous totem of glints",
    "upon rainy Buenos Aires transfusions",
    "above the urinal coppers of a flaming polar star rise",
    "of course",
    "kinetic",
    "like magical malachite rivers",
    "flowing from moons",
    "blowing through the 3/4 summits of motionless anginas",
    "I\u2019ve looked",
    "for only the tonalities that scorch",
    "which bring to my lips wave after wave",
    "of sensitivity by virulence",
    "yes",
    "a merciless bitterness",
    "brewed by a blue-black tornado of verbs",
    "in a surge of flashing scorpion chatter",
    "in a dessicated storm of inferential parallels & voltage",
    "like a scattered igneous wind",
    "co-terminus with the bleeding hiatus & the resumption of breath",
    "resolved by flash point edicts",
    "by consumptive stellar limes",
    "by curvature in tense proto-Bretonian fatigue",
    "mixing magnets",
    "juggling centripetal anti-podes & infinities",
    "cracking the smoke of pure rupestral magentas",
    "yes",
    "hatcheries",
    "floating through acetylene corruption of practiced mental restraint",
    "to splendiferous vistas mingled with inspirational roulette",
    "its mysteriums",
    "always leaping like a grainy rash of scorching tarantellas",
    "or leaking moon spun alloestrophas*",
    "as if speaking",
    "in irregular glossological green Dutch",
    "a frenetic seminar on febricity",
    "a reitteration of hendecasyllabic agitation & stinging",
    "a ferocious vacillation",
    "explosive as random \u201caggregational\u201d nodes",
    "mimed by a black consonantal dissection",
    "its maximal priority",
    "forked at \u201chypotactic inclusion\u201d",
    "with isochronous internal procedure",
    "with ratios",
    "with phonic penetralia by distortion",
    "primed by anomalous \u201cnuclear accent\u201d",
    "by a cadence composing syllables & compounds",
    "yes",
    "poetics",
    "its force",
    "jettisoned by \u201chypotaxis\u201d",
    "by ... paratactic co-ordination",
    "& fire"
