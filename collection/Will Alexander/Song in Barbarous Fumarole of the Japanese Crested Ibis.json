    "\u201cTo claim as arcane vapour",
    "ruination by intrigue",
    "by kindled leprosy morays",
    "so that I take up in my glottis",
    "these moral hallucinogens which actively dim",

    "with bird interrogation",
    "with a haunted crystallography of deception",
    "mentally cross-fertilized with defective aural lobotomies",
    "so that I momentarily sing",
    "with a cosmic catch in my wings",
    "floating above",
    "a black waterfall of rye",
    "dazzled by partial torments",
    "by seeming in-seminal scatterings",
    "by snow in smoking germinal mazes",
    "it could be said that my blood has been scorched",
    "by intensive Venusian plasma",
    "by updrafts of wheat",
    "by molecules that slaughter",
    "my throat continuously parched",
    "by wild in-secular genetics",

    "carving androgynous shapes with my voice",
    "me",
    "an ominous fluttering angel",
    "kept aloft by diagrams",
    "of smouldering electrical truth",
    "as a tempestuous solar charisma",
    "I can never speak in terms of oceanic remorse",

    "by prisms of seasoned parallel tornadoes",
    "though shattered by various Saxon devices",
    "I am the flame throughout the soaring absolute",
    "I denigrate",
    "I take on sanguine territorial opposition",
    "with a force",
    "enriched",
    "with untoward fertility",
    "with a dominate tendency to waver",
    "with excessive a-regional metrics",
    "with inhaled phantasmics",
    "spilled on fortuitous migrational soils",
    "there is ermine",
    "there is discourse by nugget",
    "there is scarification by increase",
    "each of my echoes spinning through pictographic parabolas",
    "graphic",
    "with indecisive incest",
    "which abstractly reduces",
    "which plummets",
    "into the frothing systemic of bees",
    "a crepuscular arachnoidal utterance by sun bells",
    "by pestilential archive",
    "by vivid tourmaline exposure",
    "there is expressed interstice",
    "flotational temperature by prophet",
    "by sun exposed Greek",

    "singing in capsized tarantula tree",
    "melodramatic by despair",
    "cogitation by a sense of entrapment",
    "split along the cusp of a-tonal meridians",
    "each guttural burst",
    "struggling at great odds",
    "at hieroglyphical knife point",
    "dazed with magnetic electrical fuchsia",
    "each of my wingbeats as death",
    "as co-existent termination",
    "as spoiled rudiment by colour",
    "so I splice my lamentations",
    "& open the diachronic",
    "to spawned confusional rotations",
    "amidst the equator of sundogs",
    "heated by corrupted memorial sparks",
    "my beak aligned with cryptographic cunning",
    "with tantric scratches inside my steaming ink well treaties",

    "from a barbarous daily wine",
    "here I am",
    "winged",
    "with oracular sun-dust flowers",
    "my eyes scattered into translated demon",
    "like a blue demonic spy",
