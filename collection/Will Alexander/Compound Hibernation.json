    "Those who glance about me",
    "who cease to see inside the Sun",
    "who cease to imagine its destabilized pre-quanta",
    "cannot know me",
    "cannot know my ethos as pumice",
    "as mingled apparition or flare",
    "my perception through the prior sun that I ingest",
    "like a blackened pre-existence",
    "or collected hawks through assignation",
    "the Sun",
    "with its dualisms",
    "with its pre-biotic photons which waver",
    "perhaps",
    "9 suns before the Sun existed",
    "before the oceans seemed formed",
    "there were molecular drafts",
    "akashic precursors",
    "floating proto-ammonia",
    "I think of carbon",
    "& wisps",
    "& floodings",
    "of feral combat shelter",
    "where blank geometry accrues",
    "before separable biology was born",
    "before the contradictory ballast of de-existent protozoa",
    "being scorching photon by abstentia",
    "like a pre-atomic sigil",
    "destabilized as blizzard",
    "a pre-cognitive rotation",
    "a strange galvanics of the cosmos",
    "& because of this galvanics",
    "one reeks of invisible tremor",
    "walking around in league with daunting helium affliction",
    "thus",
    "the mirrors in my skin like haunted salamander fluid",
    "like cells bereft with cooling centigrade rotation",
    "therefore",
    "I know the abyss as volatile lunar transposition",
    "as sub-liminal mantis as climbing",
    "as splintering",
    "therefore I am not",
    "an oily or blasphemous yogin",
    "collapsing in default by sudden anger or water",
    "yet I am compound",
    "struggling with scattered mental a-rhythmia",
    "with partial psychic aphasia",
    "intensive",
    "illusive",
    "aloof by interior compounding"
