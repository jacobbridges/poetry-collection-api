    "To unlock predisposives in carbon",
    "to cancel sleep as pyretical drachma",
    "not as transaxial summa",
    "or intense aboriginal invasive",
    "but as promenade",
    "as forgery by craft",
    "as soiled apparitional anagram",
    "yes",
    "as a dark stochastic wheat drained of its magic as drift",
    "being boundary",
    "being hellish invention as grasp",
    "I am thinking of aroused electrical blockage",
    "of human monsoon killing as treaty",
    "as breach",
    "as strangled impulse by identity",
    "I mean",
    "the psychic root which is stained by dialectical illness",
    "by the thought contained in black ozonal mirrors",
    "where general slaughter is reflected",
    "where the mind impels its wits by bleak molecular isolation",
    "by stunted mangrove withdrawal",
    "by absence from the life of euphoric solar trees",
    "such prone negation",
    "imploded from the realms of a suicide foundry",
    "of broken wisdom as diamond",
    "it is an eon of fallen snow in a well",
    "an injudicious barrier gone awry",
    "the ingrained Eurocentric example",
    "of the hatred of the darker integument",
    "with its combative belligerence against the core",
    "of volational mystery",
    "so what concerns me",
    "is a yoga which implodes the sun",
    "which compounds its runics",
    "the body then electric",
    "like a stunning sapphire serpent",
    "with the arc of its cells",
    "alive as interior alter species",
    "as an eye of analogical waters",
    "no longer of ennui",
    "of the praxis of perfidious helium atrocity",
    "extended by the vapour of betrayal",
    "by the dazed imperceptives in the molecules",
    "here",
    "in such preternatural enclave",
    "I swim in the murmur of sun dogs",
    "of kindled potentate spasms",
    "like interior distillation",
    "from Moorish pre-Copernica",
    "as if",
    "at the height of Kemetic day",
    "there existed the dauntless sphinxian geometries",
    "those pre-existent personas of lightning",
    "no longer of the form of gravity as bastion",
    "of lingering ammonia in the genes",
    "but of absent chemical flaw",
    "the body becoming",
    "the magic flight of a transmuted corium",
    "of the bell of a bloodless liminal amber"
