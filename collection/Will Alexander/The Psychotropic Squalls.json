    "To peer into the obverse",
    "into smoking cane field erratums",
    "as if haunted with the steamy colitis of whirling iridium",
    "cancellations",
    "as in the saliva of newts",
    "one sees the intestinal raging of deltas",
    "of blackened sea giraffes osmotically split into simultaneous alums",
    "above a judgemental sea glistening with Richters",
    "like a weakened neutron egg",
    "its fissioning petrol mirages like spirals of irregular hunting geese",
    "flying through flames of ulcerated smoke & gargantua",
    "hissing a blank imperial greenness",
    "rising above dense jetties of cobras",
    "the shocking demise of the sea",
    "the unlivingness of its winds",
    "scorched by irradiations of shaking brine incisions",
    "the burning gulfs of sun with a glint of explosive Mandean utopias*",
    "shocks against Old Testament linear prophetics",
    "of Jeremiah",
    "or Ezekiel",
    "or the bony frozen finger shaking stunted alchemical missives",
    "from a moon burned Judea",
    "no more than a mechanically burning moat focused on smoky",
    "spellbinder\u2019s disruptives",
    "where the motion of the soul is delayed",
    "reduced to flattened agnostic secular smoke",
    "to a terrestrial rage which eliminates its sensuous heavenly fires",
    "its stunning unreplicated angers",
    "its sudden selenium spirals",
    "its fire which staggers across the pseudo-faultlines of pre-replicated judgement",
    "its flirtation with spirits of enriched Draconian plankton",
    "so that the soul with its amber of flashing microbe drachmas",
    "with its wounded tourmaline divisibilities",
    "flaming within a light of smeared tornado weathers",
    "within a shower of black fish scales & spleen",
    "is entombed",
    "within a blank thirstless psycho-motion",
    "falling from a furnace of stars",
    "which both flares up and freezes",
    "which inculcates a flawed microbial botany",
    "as in hypnotic grammatical emulsions",
    "within a hollowed elliptical opening where we witness old",
    "Egyptian surgeries",
    "where the dead magically rise up from mazes",
    "& stare in a language of scorching totemic anomaly",
    "spawned in heretical miniature",
    "their phantoms",
    "seeping from quadrilateral sutures",
    "from brief",
    "violent",
    "renunciatory squalls",
    "uprooted",
    "armed with the weaponry of ghouls",
    "& broken birch tree lizards",
    "seasoned by the light of psychotropic angles",
    "blazing in the middle of a green Venusian interior God",
    "singing",
    "as if",
    "in the fumaroles of anguish",
    "with an inclement bleeding",
    "with a littered corona",
    "of unstable altimeter reverses"
