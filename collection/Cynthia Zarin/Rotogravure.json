    "There was another life we knew each other",
    "We were poor and hungry we lived in a palace",
    "Cats supped in our place aloft we ate air",
    "Trees were our nursemaids the moss sang to us",
    "The door was heavy the reed gate was smashed",
    "We drove through smoke we rode in carriages",
    "We were far from the shore the ocean was near",
    "The sky was jute the wet earth gray ash",
    "We spoke in English in Russian we argued",
    "The moon wore a mask the sun mirrored its moods",
    "In the desert the thirsty went down to the water",
    "Hummingbirds swarmed lions roared in quarries",
    "Silence is an envelope noise is paper",
    "This is a story poems come after stories"
