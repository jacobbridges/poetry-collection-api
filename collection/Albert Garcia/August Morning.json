    "It\u2019s ripe, the melon",
    "by our sink. Yellow,",
    "bee-bitten, soft, it perfumes",
    "the house too sweetly.",
    "At five I wake, the air",
    "mournful in its quiet.",
    "My wife\u2019s eyes swim calmly",
    "under their lids, her mouth and jaw",
    "relaxed, different.",
    "What is happening in the silence",
    "of this house? Curtains",
    "hang heavily from their rods.",
    "Ficus leaves tremble",
    "at my footsteps. Yet",
    "the colors outside are perfect--",
    "orange geranium, blue lobelia.",
    "I wander from room to room",
    "like a man in a museum:",
    "wife, children, books, flowers,",
    "melon. Such still air. Soon",
    "the mid-morning breeze will float in",
    "like tepid water, then hot.",
    "How do I start this day,",
    "I who am unsure",
    "of how my life has happened",
    "or how to proceed",
    "amid this warm and steady sweetness?"
