    "One granite ridge",
    "A tree, would be enough",
    "Or even a rock, a small creek,",
    "A bark shred in a pool.",
    "Hill beyond hill, folded and twisted",
    "Tough trees crammed",
    "In thin stone fractures",
    "A huge moon on it all, is too much.",
    "The mind wanders. A million",
    "Summers, night air still and the rocks",
    "Warm. Sky over endless mountains.",
    "All the junk that goes with being human",
    "Drops away, hard rock wavers",
    "Even the heavy present seems to fail",
    "This bubble of a heart.",
    "Words and books",
    "Like a small creek off a high ledge",
    "Gone in the dry air.",
    "A clear, attentive mind",
    "Has no meaning but that",
    "Which sees is truly seen.",
    "No one loves rock, yet we are here.",
    "Night chills. A flick",
    "In the moonlight",
    "Slips into Juniper shadow:",
    "Back there unseen",
    "Cold proud eyes",
    "Of Cougar or Coyote",
    "Watch me rise and go."
