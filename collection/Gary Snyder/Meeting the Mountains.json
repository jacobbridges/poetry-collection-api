    "He crawls to the edge of the foaming creek",
    "He backs up the slab ledge",
    "He puts a finger in the water",
    "He turns to a trapped pool",
    "Puts both hands in the water",
    "Puts one foot in the pool",
    "Drops pebbles in the pool",
    "He slaps the water surface with both hands",
    "He cries out, rises up and stands",
    "Facing toward the torrent and the mountain",
    "Raises up both hands and shouts three times!"
