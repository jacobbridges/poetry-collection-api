    "Perspective never withers from their eyes;",
    "They keep that docile edict of the Spring",
    "That blends March with August Antarctic skies:",
    "These are but cows that see no other thing",
    "Than grass and snow, and their own inner being",
    "Through the rich halo that they do not trouble",
    "Even to cast upon the seasons fleeting",
    "Though they should thin and die on last year\u2019s stubble.",
    "And they are awkward, ponderous and uncoy . . .",
    "While we who press the cider mill, regarding them\u2014",
    "We, who with pledges taste the bright annoy",
    "Of friendship\u2019s acid wine, retarding phlegm,",
    "Shifting reprisals (\u2019til who shall tell us when",
    "The jest is too sharp to be kindly?) boast",
    "Much of our store of faith in other men",
    "Who would, ourselves, stalk down the merriest ghost.",
    "Above them old Mizzentop, palatial white",
    "Hostelry\u2014floor by floor to cinquefoil dormer",
    "Portholes the ceilings stack their stoic height.",
    "Long tiers of windows staring out toward former",
    "Faces\u2014loose panes crown the hill and gleam",
    "At sunset with a silent, cobwebbed patience . . .",
    "See them, like eyes that still uphold some dream",
    "Through mapled vistas, cancelled reservations!",
    "High from the central cupola, they say",
    "One\u2019s glance could cross the borders of three states;",
    "But I have seen death\u2019s stare in slow survey",
    "From four horizons that no one relates . . .",
    "Weekenders avid of their turf-won scores,",
    "Here three hours from the semaphores, the Czars",
    "Of golf, by twos and threes in plaid plusfours",
    "Alight with sticks abristle and cigars.",
    "This was the Promised Land, and still it is",
    "To the persuasive suburban land agent",
    "In bootleg roadhouses where the gin fizz",
    "Bubbles in time to Hollywood\u2019s new love-nest pageant.",
    "Fresh from the radio in the old Meeting House",
    "(Now the New Avalon Hotel) volcanoes roar",
    "A welcome to highsteppers that no mouse",
    "Who saw the Friends there ever heard before.",
    "What cunning neighbors history has in fine!",
    "The woodlouse mortgages the ancient deal",
    "Table that Powitzky buys for only nine-",
    "Ty-five at Adams\u2019 auction,\u2014eats the seal,",
    "The spinster polish of antiquity . . .",
    "Who holds the lease on time and on disgrace?",
    "What eats the pattern with ubiquity?",
    "Where are my kinsmen and the patriarch race?",
    "The resigned factions of the dead preside.",
    "Dead rangers bled their comfort on the snow;",
    "But I must ask slain Iroquois to guide",
    "Me farther than scalped Yankees knew to go:",
    "Shoulder the curse of sundered parentage,",
    "Wait for the postman driving from Birch Hill",
    "With birthright by blackmail, the arrant page",
    "That unfolds a new destiny to fill . . . .",
    "So, must we from the hawk\u2019s far stemming view,",
    "Must we descend as worm\u2019s eye to construe",
    "Our love of all we touch, and take it to the Gate",
    "As humbly as a guest who knows himself too late,",
    "His news already told? Yes, while the heart is wrung,",
    "Arise\u2014yes, take this sheaf of dust upon your tongue!",
    "In one last angelus lift throbbing throat\u2014",
    "Listen, transmuting silence with that stilly note",
    "Of pain that Emily, that Isadora knew!",
    "While high from dim elm-chancels hung with dew,",
    "That triple-noted clause of moonlight\u2014",
    "Yes, whip-poor-will, unhusks the heart of fright,",
    "Breaks us and saves, yes, breaks the heart, yet yields",
    "That patience that is armour and that shields",
    "Love from despair\u2014when love forsees the end\u2014",
    "Leaf after autumnal leaf",
    "break off,",
    "descend\u2014",
    "descend\u2014"
