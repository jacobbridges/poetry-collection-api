    "The seagull\u2019s wings shall dip and pivot him,",
    "Shedding white rings of tumult, building high",
    "Over the chained bay waters Liberty\u2014",
    "Then, with inviolate curve, forsake our eyes",
    "As apparitional as sails that cross",
    "Some page of figures to be filed away;",
    "\u2014Till elevators drop us from our day ...",
    "I think of cinemas, panoramic sleights",
    "With multitudes bent toward some flashing scene",
    "Never disclosed, but hastened to again,",
    "Foretold to other eyes on the same screen;",
    "And Thee, across the harbor, silver paced",
    "As though the sun took step of thee yet left",
    "Some motion ever unspent in thy stride,\u2014",
    "Implicitly thy freedom staying thee!",
    "Out of some subway scuttle, cell or loft",
    "A bedlamite speeds to thy parapets,",
    "Tilting there momently, shrill shirt ballooning,",
    "A jest falls from the speechless caravan.",
    "Down Wall, from girder into street noon leaks,",
    "A rip-tooth of the sky\u2019s acetylene;",
    "All afternoon the cloud flown derricks turn ...",
    "Thy cables breathe the North Atlantic still.",
    "And obscure as that heaven of the Jews,",
    "Thy guerdon ... Accolade thou dost bestow",
    "Of anonymity time cannot raise:",
    "Vibrant reprieve and pardon thou dost show.",
    "O harp and altar, of the fury fused,",
    "(How could mere toil align thy choiring strings!",
    "Terrific threshold of the prophet\u2019s pledge,",
    "Prayer of pariah, and the lover\u2019s cry,",
    "Again the traffic lights that skim thy swift",
    "Unfractioned idiom, immaculate sigh of stars,",
    "Beading thy path\u2014condense eternity:",
    "And we have seen night lifted in thine arms.",
    "Under thy shadow by the piers I waited",
    "Only in darkness is thy shadow clear.",
    "The City\u2019s fiery parcels all undone,",
    "Already snow submerges an iron year ...",
    "O Sleepless as the river under thee,",
    "Vaulting the sea, the prairies\u2019 dreaming sod,",
    "Unto us lowliest sometime sweep, descend",
    "And of the curveship lend a myth to God."
