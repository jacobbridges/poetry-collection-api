    "In the beginning we could hear their swords cutting jewels",
    "From the protected orchard while our children heard fine teeth",
    "Dragging along empty granary floors. Between us and them",
    "Stands the great wound, swallowing all tears, all voices.",
    "Transfixed or transformed by this pain? We never know because",
    "Who can slip through the gate without throwing a shadow",
    "Toward both the past and present? Fire, flood, famine\u2014",
    "All we've wished upon them a thousand times, still they inch",
    "Back and taunt us with their persistence. We track them down",
    "To a quick end. More come. And the old memories grow new.",
    "The future seems already written with a pen of iron. The book",
    "Unreadable, immense. The enemy has become our masterpiece."
