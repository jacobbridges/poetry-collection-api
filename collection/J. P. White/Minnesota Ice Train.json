    "Some men who are at least fifty-five",
    "wake up in the night to touch their sex",
    "like patting the family dog on the head.",
    "Others rise to pace the square of their den",
    "as if called to guard duty. Still others",
    "peer back at me from their bedroom windows",
    "as if on lookout for some lost shipment",
    "to arrive from Bitterroot, Montana.",
    "I uncurl in bed listening for the 3 AM train",
    "to whip through Wayzata, hugging the lake",
    "so close I imagine it could skip the hot rails",
    "and skid across the ancestral ice toward me,",
    "an ice train come to ferry me home or away",
    "from my encircling command or back to some",
    "earlier time when I too was more fiercely",
    "racing the night, my body clamorous thumping,",
    "the windows rattling, the length of me",
    "moon-drenched, snow falling, sparks raking",
    "my wheels, one more town flown through."
