    "My book is largely growing;",
    "Its leaves are multiplied;",
    "Its pages are much longer,",
    "And nearly twice as wide.",
    "At first I thought the reader",
    "Had not the time to spare,",
    "To hail my little volume",
    "As it floated in the air.",
    "I thought perhaps while floating",
    "Away through empty space,",
    "Perchance would there discover",
    "Some long forgotten race.",
    "I knew not it would mingle",
    "Among the great and wise,",
    "Or that it would be subject",
    "Unto the critic\u2019s eyes.",
    "I thought it was inferior,",
    "And of the minor class,",
    "I knew not how the ladies",
    "Would read it as they pass.",
    "But now I find it\u2019s useful,",
    "And laden every page,",
    "For truly it must mingle",
    "With those of every age.",
    "Therefore I should have measured;",
    "Should not have thought it vain",
    "To make its little mysteries",
    "Unto the reader plain.",
    "But surely there\u2019s no secret",
    "Where thought is not sublime,",
    "That I have thus destroyed",
    "By keeping up my rhyme.",
    "But if I should in future",
    "Find this to be the case,",
    "I\u2019d take my silver pencil",
    "And all these lines erase.",
    "I\u2019d rather use a license,",
    "Or grammar\u2019s laws dispense,",
    "Than for to let my metre",
    "Or rhythm govern sense.",
    "The read will remember",
    "My chances are but slim,",
    "Or else this little volume",
    "Would be in better trim.",
    "Remember, too, in Dixie",
    "That I was born a slave.",
    "And all my early genius",
    "Was locked within the grave.",
    "Remember my condition\u2014",
    "A mark within my eyes\u2014",
    "And all my inspirations",
    "Are showered from the skies.",
    "I cannot read of authors,",
    "Nor those of noble fame,",
    "For I\u2019m just a learning",
    "The author, Milton\u2019s, name.",
    "I cannot borrow subjects,",
    "Nor rob them of their style,",
    "My book amid their volumes,",
    "Like me, is but a child.",
    "Therefore, I bless this volume,",
    "And send with it my heart,",
    "That it may to the critic",
    "My better thoughts impart.",
    "Go forth, then, little volume,",
    "Much good from thee may spring,",
    "If thou continueth pleading",
    "The merits of thy King.",
    "And others yet may follow,",
    "All changed within their scale,",
    "But thou, upon thy mission,",
    "I am sure can never fail."
