    "Aristotle was a little man with",
    "eyes like a lizard, and he found a streak",
    "down the midst of things, a smooth place for his feet",
    "much more important than the carved handles",
    "on the coffins of the great.",
    "He said you should put your hand out",
    "at the time and place of need:",
    "strength matters little, he said,",
    "nor even speed.",
    "His pupil, a king's son, died",
    "at an early age. That Aristotle spoke of him",
    "it is impossible to find\u2014the youth was",
    "notorious, a conqueror, a kid with a gang,",
    "but even this Aristotle didn't ever say.",
    "Around the farthest forest and along",
    "all the bed of the sea, Aristotle studied",
    "immediate, local ways. Many of which",
    "were wrong. So he studied poetry.",
    "There, in pity and fear, he found Man.",
    "Many thinkers today, who stand low and grin,",
    "have little use for anger or power, its palace",
    "or its prison\u2014",
    "but quite a bit for that little man",
    "with eyes like a lizard."
