    "When we first moved here, pulled",
    "the trees in around us, curled",
    "our backs to the wind, no one",
    "had ever hit the moon\u2014no one.",
    "Now our trees are safer than the stars,",
    "and only other people's neglect",
    "is our precious and abiding shell,",
    "pierced by meteors, radar, and the telephone.",
    "From our snug place we shout",
    "religiously for attention, in order to hide:",
    "only silence or evasion will bring",
    "dangerous notice, the hovering hawk",
    "of the state, or the sudden quiet stare",
    "and fatal estimate of an alerted neighbor.",
    "This message we smuggle out in",
    "its plain cover, to be opened",
    "quietly: Friends everywhere\u2014",
    "we are alive! Those moon rockets",
    "have missed millions of secret",
    "places! Best wishes.",
    "Burn this."
