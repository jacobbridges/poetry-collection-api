    "My Soul, there is a country",
    "Afar beyond the stars,",
    "Where stands a winged sentry",
    "All skillful in the wars;",
    "There, above noise and danger",
    "Sweet Peace sits, crown\u2019d with smiles,",
    "And One born in a manger",
    "Commands the beauteous files.",
    "He is thy gracious friend",
    "And (O my Soul awake!)",
    "Did in pure love descend,",
    "To die here for thy sake.",
    "If thou canst get but thither,",
    "There grows the flow\u2019r of peace,",
    "The rose that cannot wither,",
    "Thy fortress, and thy ease.",
    "Leave then thy foolish ranges,",
    "For none can thee secure,",
    "But One, who never changes,",
    "Thy God, thy life, thy cure."
