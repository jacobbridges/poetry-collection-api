    "A ward, and still in bonds, one day",
    "I stole abroad;",
    "It was high spring, and all the way",
    "Primrosed and hung with shade;",
    "Yet was it frost within,",
    "And surly winds",
    "Blasted my infant buds, and sin",
    "Like clouds eclipsed my mind.",
    "Stormed thus, I straight perceived my spring",
    "Mere stage and show,",
    "My walk a monstrous, mountained thing,",
    "Roughcast with rocks and snow;",
    "And as a pilgrim\u2019s eye,",
    "Far from relief,",
    "Measures the melancholy sky,",
    "Then drops and rains for grief,",
    "So sighed I upwards still; at last",
    "\u2019Twixt steps and falls",
    "I reached the pinnacle, where placed",
    "I found a pair of scales;",
    "I took them up and laid",
    "In th\u2019 one, late pains;",
    "The other smoke and pleasures weighed,",
    "But proved the heavier grains.",
    "With that some cried, \u201cAway!\u201d Straight I",
    "Obeyed, and led",
    "Full east, a fair, fresh field could spy;",
    "Some called it Jacob\u2019s bed,",
    "A virgin soil which no",
    "Rude feet ere trod,",
    "Where, since he stepped there, only go",
    "Prophets and friends of God.",
    "Here I reposed; but scarce well set,",
    "A grove descried",
    "Of stately height, whose branches met",
    "And mixed on every side;",
    "I entered, and once in,",
    "Amazed to see \u2019t,",
    "Found all was changed, and a new spring",
    "Did all my senses greet.",
    "The unthrift sun shot vital gold,",
    "A thousand pieces,",
    "And heaven its azure did unfold,",
    "Checkered with snowy fleeces;",
    "The air was all in spice,",
    "And every bush",
    "A garland wore; thus fed my eyes,",
    "But all the ear lay hush.",
    "Only a little fountain lent",
    "Some use for ears,",
    "And on the dumb shades language spent",
    "The music of her tears;",
    "I drew her near, and found",
    "The cistern full",
    "Of divers stones, some bright and round,",
    "Others ill-shaped and dull.",
    "The first, pray mark, as quick as light",
    "Danced through the flood,",
    "But the last, more heavy than the night,",
    "Nailed to the center stood;",
    "I wondered much, but tired",
    "At last with thought,",
    "My restless eye that still desired",
    "As strange an object brought.",
    "It was a bank of flowers, where I descried",
    "Though \u2019twas midday,",
    "Some fast asleep, others broad-eyed",
    "And taking in the ray;",
    "Here, musing long, I heard",
    "A rushing wind",
    "Which still increased, but whence it stirred",
    "No where I could not find.",
    "I turned me round, and to each shade",
    "Dispatched an eye",
    "To see if any leaf had made",
    "Least motion or reply,",
    "But while I listening sought",
    "My mind to ease",
    "By knowing where \u2019twas, or where not,",
    "It whispered, \u201cWhere I please.\u201d",
    "\u201cLord,\u201d then said I, \u201con me one breath,",
    "And let me die before my death!\u201d",
    "Arise O North, and come thou South-wind and blow upon my garden, that",
    "the spices thereof may flow out."
