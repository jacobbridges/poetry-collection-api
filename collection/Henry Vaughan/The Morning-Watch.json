    "O joys! infinite sweetness! with what flow\u2019rs",
    "And shoots of glory my soul breaks and buds!",
    "All the long hours",
    "Of night, and rest,",
    "Through the still shrouds",
    "Of sleep, and clouds,",
    "This dew fell on my breast;",
    "Oh, how it bloods",
    "And spirits all my earth! Hark! In what rings",
    "And hymning circulations the quick world",
    "Awakes and sings;",
    "The rising winds",
    "And falling springs,",
    "Birds, beasts, all things",
    "Adore him in their kinds.",
    "Thus all is hurl\u2019d",
    "In sacred hymns and order, the great chime",
    "And symphony of nature. Prayer is",
    "The world in tune,",
    "A spirit voice,",
    "And vocal joys",
    "Whose echo is heav\u2019n\u2019s bliss.",
    "O let me climb",
    "When I lie down! The pious soul by night",
    "Is like a clouded star whose beams, though said",
    "To shed their light",
    "Under some cloud,",
    "Yet are above,",
    "And shine and move",
    "Beyond that misty shroud.",
    "So in my bed,",
    "That curtain\u2019d grave, though sleep, like ashes, hide",
    "My lamp and life, both shall in thee abide."
