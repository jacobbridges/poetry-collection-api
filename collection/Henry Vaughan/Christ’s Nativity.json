    "Awake, glad heart! get up and sing!",
    "It is the birth-day of thy King.",
    "Awake! awake!",
    "The Sun doth shake",
    "Light from his locks, and all the way",
    "Breathing perfumes, doth spice the day.",
    "Awake, awake! hark how th\u2019 wood rings;",
    "Winds whisper, and the busy springs",
    "A concert make;",
    "Awake! awake!",
    "Man is their high-priest, and should rise",
    "To offer up the sacrifice.",
    "I would I were some bird, or star,",
    "Flutt\u2019ring in woods, or lifted far",
    "Above this inn",
    "And road of sin!",
    "Then either star or bird should be",
    "Shining or singing still to thee.",
    "I would I had in my best part",
    "Fit rooms for thee! or that my heart",
    "Were so clean as",
    "Thy manger was!",
    "But I am all filth, and obscene;",
    "Yet, if thou wilt, thou canst make clean.",
    "Sweet Jesu! will then. Let no more",
    "This leper haunt and soil thy door!",
    "Cure him, ease him,",
    "O release him!",
    "And let once more, by mystic birth,",
    "The Lord of life be born in earth."
