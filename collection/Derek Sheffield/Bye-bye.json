    "The animal of winter is dying,",
    "its white body everywhere",
    "in collapse and stabbed at",
    "by straws of light, a leaving",
    "to believe in as the air",
    "slowly fills with darkness",
    "and water drains from the tub",
    "where my daughter, watching it",
    "lower around her, feeling it",
    "go, says about the only thing",
    "she can as if it were a long-",
    "kept breath going with her",
    "blessing of dribble and fleck.",
    "Down it swirls a living drill",
    "vanishing toward a land",
    "where tomorrow already",
    "fixes its bright eye on a man",
    "muttering his way into a crowd,",
    "saying about the only thing",
    "he can before his body",
    "goes",
    ". And tomorrow,",
    "I will count more dark shapes",
    "tumbling from the sky, birds",
    "returning to scarcity, offering",
    "in their seesawing songs",
    "a kind of liquidity."
