    "Apprentice morning come easily now,",
    "silver with fog and the breakdowns",
    "of neighbors: shouts from up hill",
    "where the land curls under vines and under the porches",
    "of oaks, where even now",
    "wintergreen and inkberry shiver forth",
    "streamers of new growth, and the green frogs",
    "suck at the dew and sing their bent songs.",
    "It is easy",
    "to hear my own voice in the liquid",
    "contraltos of rage, the vents",
    "and accusations that feed fires",
    "up the hill. It is all human enough,",
    "the yelling, capacious",
    "and frank, the doors slamming, cries",
    "of betrayal. I too have betrayed,",
    "lost my place among the condensations",
    "of commitment, dallied.",
    "I go among friends",
    "who say with neither fear nor fury in their voices",
    "that they too don\u2019t know what\u2019s next, that from the studied",
    "impactment of their lives",
    "they have sallied small lines",
    "of proposition, made a few calls. Slight affairs",
    "shiver and fail; we go for a walk",
    "by the rotunda, where, on the perishable lawn,",
    "a band plays Dixieland\u2014speaking,",
    "not earnestly, but with steady intent,",
    "of the play of choices, the simple chance",
    "of another future somewhere else, perhaps a house",
    "in the hills above L.A., part-time work",
    "for the screen, a few avocado trees. For a while",
    "it is as if the hazy play of evening light,",
    "the splashes of music, the unbundled oaks",
    "surrounding the Square, are enough",
    "in themselves to sustain, as if mood",
    "is itself sustenance, that our struggle to conceive",
    "a continuance is of no more moment",
    "than the fuchsia and soft yellow clothes of the tourists.",
    "Perhaps it is possible",
    "to be gentle no matter what, to seek not restraint",
    "but surrender entirely, to turn",
    "from the snarling reproach not into the keening",
    "dismissal of hope but to whatever bright",
    "fluttering is next, the bright fluttering",
    "of wisteria petals, a felicitous",
    "phrase, fingers touching",
    "a face. How else to avoid",
    "redemption,",
    "or its opposite, which we stopped believing",
    "in one day in high school, suddenly startled",
    "over a steaming lunch tray by the way the fizzed",
    "flowers of a stunted mimosa",
    "seemed to beg for release? We realized then",
    "we could say whatever we wanted, that the world",
    "was no more particular",
    "than anything else, it too could be out-argued,",
    "confused by refusal or lies, that it was no wonder",
    "people were stunned",
    "by the eloquent permanence of death.",
    "So there is",
    "permission, not granted",
    "but given, as a forsythia at the edge of the walk,",
    "having stolen more light",
    "than it can contain, trembles, and the echoes",
    "of argument fade into a fluttering",
    "over the price of butterscotch floats,",
    "and we are dazzled",
    "by the gouge of perception, as if there was in fact a word",
    "we were waiting to hear, not",
    "as completion but as synoptic",
    "and inevitable entitlement\u2014the drift",
    "of some stranger\u2019s conversation,",
    "the memory of a thin mist",
    "moored temporarily over the garden, that face",
    "we saw from the window on the way to St. Albans: beautiful,",
    "indifferent, unequivocably doomed."
