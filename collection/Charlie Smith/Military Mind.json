    "I wanted to go to military school",
    "and march, I wanted to grow up",
    "and be composed and expert",
    "with a rifle, with tactics and fighting,",
    "to be safe and courageous among men",
    "in barracks and on the battlefield.",
    "I wanted to see my arms hairy and",
    "corded with muscle at the end of rolled up khaki sleeves.",
    "I wanted to flex my feet in boots and",
    "look down at the the dust of battles",
    "dimming the leather surfaces, the blood slick",
    "on the rim of the soles. I wanted",
    "the smell of gunpowder in my nostrils, the grime",
    "on my face, the washed-out hollow",
    "love for my comrades found in the foxholes,",
    "the sad understanding, the requiems",
    "of late afternoons walking away from the burial site",
    "with the widow as she cradled the triangulated flag",
    "like a plowblade in her arms."
