    "The class skeptic (he later refused to sign",
    "anyone\u2019\ufeffs yearbook, calling it a sentimental",
    "degradation of language) chloroformed mice,",
    "weighing the bodies before and after",
    "to catch the weight of the soul,",

    "than a single aspirin could finish",
    "something as large as a life. I thought of this",
    "because, today, the dusky seaside sparrow",
    "became extinct. It may never be as famous",

    "but the last one died today, a resident",
    "of Walt Disney World where now its tissue samples",
    "lie frozen, in case someday we learn to clone",
    "one from a few cells. Like those instant dinosaurs",
    "that come in a gelatin capsule\u2014just add water",
    "and they inflate. One other thing this",
    "brings to mind. The euglena girl won first prize",
    "both for science and, I think, in retrospect, for hope."
