    "Then I was sealed, and like the wintering tree",
    "I stood me locked upon a summer core;",
    "Living, had died a death, and asked no more.",
    "And I lived then, but as enduringly,",
    "And my heart beat, but only as to be.",
    "Ill weathers well, hail, gust and cold I bore,",
    "I held my life as hid, at root, in store:",
    "Thus I lived then, till this air breathed on me.",
    "Till this kind air breathed kindness everywhere,",
    "There where my times had left me I would stay.",
    "Then I was staunch, I knew nor yes nor no;",
    "But now the wishful leaves have thronged the air.",
    "My every leaf leans forth upon the day;",
    "Alas, kind element! which comes to go."
