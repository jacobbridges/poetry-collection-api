    "ROXANA from the court retiring late,",
    "Sigh'd her soft sorrows at St. JAMES's gate:",
    "Such heavy thoughts lay brooding in her breast,",
    "Not her own chairmen w",
    "more weight opprest;",
    "groan the cruel load they're doom'd to bear ;",
    "in these gentler sounds express'd her care.",
    "\" Was it for this, that I these Roses wear,",
    "\" For this new-set my Jewels for my hair ?",
    "\" Ah ! Princess ! with what zeal have I pursu'd !",
    "\" Almost forgot the",
    "of a Prude.",
    "\" Thinking I never cou'd attend too soon,",
    "\" I've miss'd my prayers, to get",
    "dress'd by noon.",
    "\" For Thee, ah ! what for Thee did I resign ?",
    "\" My Pleasures, Passions, all that e'er was mine.",
    "\" I sacrific'd both Modesty and Ease,",
    "\" Left Operas, and",
    "to filthy Plays ;",
    "\" Double entendres shock'd my tender ear,",
    "\" Yet even this for Thee I chose to bear.",
    "\" In glowing youth, when nature bids be gay,",
    "\" And ev'ry joy of life before me lay,",
    "\" By honour prompted, and by pride restrain'd,",
    "\" The pleasures of the young my soul disdain'd :",
    "\" Sermons I sought, and with a mien severe",
    "\" Censur'd my neighbours, and said daily pray'r.",
    "\" Alas ! how chang'd! \u0097 with the same sermon",
    "\" That once I pray'd, the",
    "I've seen.",
    "\" Ah ! cruel Princess, for thy sake I've lost",
    "\" That reputation which so dear had cost :",
    "\" I, who avoided ev'ry publick place,",
    "\" When bloom, and beauty bid me",
    "my face ;",
    "\" Now near Thee constant ev'ry night abide",
    "\" With never-failing duty by thy side,",
    "\" Myself and daughters standing on a row,",
    "\" To all the foreigners a goodly show !",
    "\" Oft had your drawing-room been sadly thin,",
    "\" And merchants wives close by the chair had",
    "seen ;",
    "\" Had not I amply fill'd the empty space,",
    "\" And sav'd your Highness from the dire disgrace.",
    "\" Yet COQUETILLA's artifice prevails,",
    "\" When all my merit and my duty fails :",
    "\" That COQUETILLA, whose deluding airs",
    "\" Corrupts our virgins, and our youth ensnares ;",
    "\" So sunk her character, so lost her fame,",
    "\" Scarce visited before your Highness came ;",
    "\" Yet for the Bed-chamber 'tis Her you chuse,",
    "\" When Zeal and Fame and Virtue you refuse.",
    "\" Ah ! worthy choice ! not one of all your train",
    "\" Whom censure blasts not,",
    "dishonours stain.",
    "\" Let the nice hind now suckle dirty pigs,",
    "\" And the proud pea-hen",
    "the cuckoo's eggs !",
    "\" Let IRIS leave her paint, and own her age,",
    "\" And grave SUFFOLKIA wed a giddy page !",
    "\" A greater miracle is daily view'd,",
    "\" A virtuous Princess with a court so lewd.",
    "\" I know thee, Court ! with all thy treach'rous wiles,",
    "\" Thy false caresses and undoing smiles !",
    "\" Ah ! Princess, learn'd in all the courtly arts",
    "\" To cheat our hopes, and yet to gain our hearts.",
    "\" Large lovely bribes are the great statesman's aim ;",
    "\" And the neglected patriot follows fame.",
    "\" The Prince is ogled ; some the King pursue ;",
    "\" But your ROXANA only follows YOU.",
    "\" Despis'd ROXANA, cease, and try to find",
    "\" Some other, since the Princess proves unkind :",
    "\" Perhaps it is not hard to find at court",
    "\"",
    "not a greater, a more firm support."
