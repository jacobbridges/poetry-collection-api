    "London returns in damp, fragmented flurries",
    "when I should be doing something else. A scrap",
    "of song, a pink scarf, and I\u2019m back to curries",
    "and pub food, long, wet walks without a map,",
    "bouts of bronchitis, a case of the flu,",
    "my halfhearted studies, and brooding thoughts",
    "and scanning faces in every bar for you.",
    "Those months come down to moments or small plots,",
    "like the bum on the Tube, enraged that no one spoke,",
    "who raved and spat, the whole car thick with dread,",
    "only to ask, won\u2019t someone tell a joke?",
    "and this mouse of a woman offered,",
    "and sits in the corner?",
    "A naughty bus.",
    "Not funny, I know. But neither\u2019s the story of us."
