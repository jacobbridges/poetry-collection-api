    "That we go back to life one day, the next,",
    "Some other century where we were alive,",
    "When music spelled itself out to us, often",
    "Incomplete, and nothing was more vague",
    "Than the banality of whom to love and lose",
    "In line, the doppelgangers in rimless snow,",
    "Or even now, in summer, at day, by night,",
    "When something oblivious, replete, turns",
    "Back at us in idolatrous quiet, so we see",
    "Who in nullified particulars we really are",
    "At a desk of our own making, filling in for",
    "Someone else\u2019s life sentence, blots drying",
    "On a silk tie having no meaning but today\u2019s,",
    "When the loner puts his insomnia to rest."
