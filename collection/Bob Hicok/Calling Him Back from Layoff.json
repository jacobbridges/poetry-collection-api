    "I called a man today. After he said",
    "hello and I said hello came a pause",
    "during which it would have been",
    "confusing to say hello again so I said",
    "how are you doing and guess what, he said",
    "fine and wondered aloud how I was",
    "and it turns out I\u2019m OK. He",
    "was on the couch watching cars",
    "painted with ads for Budweiser follow cars",
    "painted with ads for Tide around an oval",
    "that\u2019s a metaphor for life because",
    "most of us run out of gas and settle",
    "for getting drunk in the stands",
    "and shouting at someone in a t-shirt",
    "we want kraut on our dog. I said",
    "he could have his job back and during",
    "the pause that followed his whiskers",
    "scrubbed the mouthpiece clean",
    "and his breath passed in and out",
    "in the tidal fashion popular",
    "with mammals until he broke through",
    "with the words",
    "which crossed his lips and drove",
    "through the wires on the backs of ions",
    "as one long word as one hard prayer",
    "of relief meant to be heard",
    "by the sky. When he began to cry I tried",
    "with the shape of my silence to say",
    "I understood but each confession",
    "of fear and poverty was more awkward",
    "than what you learn in the shower.",
    "After he hung up I went outside and sat",
    "with one hand in the bower of the other",
    "and thought if I turn my head to the left",
    "it changes the song of the oriole",
    "and if I give a job to one stomach other",
    "forks are naked and if tonight a steak",
    "sizzles in his kitchen do the seven",
    "other people staring at their phones",
    "hear?"
