    "Nobody I know is a god. A mother and son",
    "fall into the river's million hands, the river's",
    "smash and grab. They go under, climb the ropeless",
    "water up, wave, open their mouths and scream",
    "wet silences as they slide back under.",
    "A man jumps in to save them, leaves the edge",
    "as a needle into the river's muddy sinews, a woman",
    "jumps in to save his vanishing and the mother",
    "and son and is stripped by the flood, her pants",
    "drowning right beside her, another man jumps in",
    "to save them all and a woman jumps in after him",
    "to save them all plus one, cars arrive and people",
    "get out and leap into the river, the river's being filled",
    "with whatever's in their pockets and their hands",
    "and their eyes, with nickels and dollar bills",
    "and bibles and sunsets, the beautiful brush strokes",
    "of this beautifully dying day, people pile",
    "like a river inside the river, they keep coming",
    "and diving in, they keep feeding their breath",
    "to the water, which is less, which is thinned,",
    "until the mother and son rise on a mound",
    "of strangers and dead, the sun warming them, blessing",
    "their faces slowly dry."
