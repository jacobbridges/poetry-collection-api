    "because they know I teach at Virginia Tech,",
    "to say, there\u2019s nothing to say. Eventually",
    "I answered these messages: there\u2019s nothing",
    "to say back except of course there\u2019s nothing",
    "to say, thank you for your willingness",
    "to say it. Because this was about nothing.",
    "A boy who felt that he was nothing,",
    "who erased and entered that erasure, and guns",
    "that are good for nothing, and talk of guns",
    "that is good for nothing, and spring",
    "that is good for flowers, and Jesus for some,",
    "and scotch for others, and \u201cand\u201d for me",

    "empty of everything but a scarf, still opens",
    "its doors at every stop, because this",
    "is what a train does, this is what a man does",
    "with his hand on a lever, because otherwise,",
    "why the lever, why the hand, and then it was over,",
    "and then it had just begun."
