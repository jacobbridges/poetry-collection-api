    "I was birthed restless and elsewhere",
    "gut dragging and bulging with ball lightning, slush,",
    "broke through with branches, steel",
    "I was bitch-monikered, hipped, I hefted",
    "a whip rain, a swirling sheet of grit.",
    "Scraping toward the first of you, hungering for wood, walls,",
    "unturned skin. With shifting and frantic mouth, I loudly loved",
    "the slow bones",
    "of elders, fools, and willows."
