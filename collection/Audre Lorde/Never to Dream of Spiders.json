    "Time collapses between the lips of strangers",
    "my days collapse into a hollow tube",
    "soon implodes against now",
    "like an iron wall",
    "my eyes are blocked with rubble",
    "a smear of perspectives",
    "blurring each horizon",
    "in the breathless precision of silence",
    "one word is made.",
    "Once the renegade flesh was gone",
    "fall air lay against my face",
    "sharp and blue as a needle",
    "but the rain fell through October",
    "and death lay a condemnation",
    "within my blood.",
    "The smell of your neck in August",
    "a fine gold wire bejeweling war",
    "all the rest lies",
    "illusive as a farmhouse",
    "on the other side of a valley",
    "vanishing in the afternoon.",
    "Day three day four day ten",
    "the seventh step",
    "a veiled door leading to my golden anniversary",
    "flameproofed free-paper shredded",
    "in the teeth of a pillaging dog",
    "never to dream of spiders",
    "and when they turned the hoses upon me",
    "a burst of light."
