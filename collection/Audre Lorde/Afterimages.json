    "I",
    "However the image enters",
    "its force remains within",
    "my eyes",
    "rockstrewn caves where dragonfish evolve",
    "wild for life, relentless and acquisitive",
    "learning to survive",
    "where there is no food",
    "my eyes are always hungry",
    "and remembering",
    "however the image enters",
    "its force remains.",
    "A white woman stands bereft and empty",
    "a black boy hacked into a murderous lesson",
    "recalled in me forever",
    "like a lurch of earth on the edge of sleep",
    "etched into my visions",
    "food for dragonfish that learn",
    "to live upon whatever they must eat",
    "fused images beneath my pain.",
    "II",
    "The Pearl River floods through the streets of Jackson",
    "A Mississippi summer televised.",
    "Trapped houses kneel like sinners in the rain",
    "a white woman climbs from her roof to a passing boat",
    "her fingers tarry for a moment on the chimney",
    "now awash",
    "tearless and no longer young, she holds",
    "a tattered baby's blanket in her arms.",
    "In a flickering afterimage of the nightmare rain",
    "a microphone",
    "thrust up against her flat bewildered words",
    "\u201cwe jest come from the bank yestiddy",
    "borrowing money to pay the income tax",
    "now everything's gone. I never knew",
    "it could be so hard.\u201d",
    "Despair weighs down her voice like Pearl River mud",
    "caked around the edges",
    "her pale eyes scanning the camera for help or explanation",
    "unanswered",
    "she shifts her search across the watered street, dry-eyed",
    "\u201chard, but not this hard.\u201d",
    "Two tow-headed children hurl themselves against her",
    "hanging upon her coat like mirrors",
    "until a man with ham-like hands pulls her aside",
    "snarling \u201cShe ain't got nothing more to say!\u201d",
    "and that lie hangs in his mouth",
    "like a shred of rotting meat.",
    "III",
    "I inherited Jackson, Mississippi.",
    "For my majority it gave me Emmett Till",
    "his 15 years puffed out like bruises",
    "on plump boy-cheeks",
    "his only Mississippi summer",
    "whistling a 21 gun salute to Dixie",
    "as a white girl passed him in the street",
    "and he was baptized my son forever",
    "in the midnight waters of the Pearl.",

    "from each corner's photographies",
    "newspapers protest posters magazines",
    "Police Story, Confidential, True",
    "the avid insistence of detail",

    "his grieving mother's lamentation",
    "the severed lips, how many burns",
    "his gouged out eyes",
    "sewed shut upon the screaming covers",
    "louder than life",
    "all over",
    "the veiled warning, the secret relish",
    "of a black child's mutilated body",
    "fingered by street-corner eyes",
    "bruise upon livid bruise",
    "and wherever I looked that summer",
    "I learned to be at home with children's blood",
    "with savored violence",
    "with pictures of black broken flesh",
    "used, crumpled, and discarded",
    "lying amid the sidewalk refuse",
    "like a raped woman's face.",
    "A black boy from Chicago",
    "whistled on the streets of Jackson, Mississippi",
    "testing what he'd been taught was a manly thing to do",
    "his teachers",
    "ripped his eyes out his sex his tongue",
    "and flung him to the Pearl weighted with stone",
    "in the name of white womanhood",
    "they took their aroused honor",
    "back to Jackson",
    "and celebrated in a whorehouse",
    "the double ritual of white manhood",
    "confirmed.",
    "IV",
    "we to refuse a crust of bread?\u201d",
    "Emmett Till rides the crest of the Pearl, whistling",
    "24 years his ghost lay like the shade of a raped woman",
    "and a white girl has grown older in costly honor",
    "(what did she pay to never know its price?)",
    "now the Pearl River speaks its muddy judgment",
    "and I can withhold my pity and my bread.",
    "\u201cHard, but not this hard.\u201d",
    "Her face is flat with resignation and despair",
    "with ancient and familiar sorrows",
    "a woman surveying her crumpled future",
    "as the white girl besmirched by Emmett's whistle",
    "never allowed her own tongue",
    "without power or conclusion",
    "unvoiced",
    "she stands adrift in the ruins of her honor",
    "and a man with an executioner's face",
    "pulls her away.",
    "Within my eyes",
    "the flickering afterimages of a nightmare rain",
    "a woman wrings her hands",
    "beneath the weight of agonies remembered",
    "I wade through summer ghosts",
    "betrayed by vision",
    "hers and my own",
    "becoming dragonfish to survive",
    "the horrors we are living",
    "with tortured lungs",
    "adapting to breathe blood.",
    "A woman measures her life's damage",
    "my eyes are caves, chunks of etched rock",
    "tied to the ghost of a black boy",
    "whistling",
    "crying and frightened",
    "her tow-headed children cluster",
    "like little mirrors of despair",
    "their father's hands upon them",
    "and soundlessly",
    "a woman begins to weep."
