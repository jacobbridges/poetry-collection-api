    "I have studied the tight curls on the back of your neck",
    "moving away from me",
    "beyond anger or failure",
    "your face in the evening schools of longing",
    "through mornings of wish and ripen",
    "we were always saying goodbye",
    "in the blood in the bone over coffee",
    "before dashing for elevators going",
    "in opposite directions",
    "without goodbyes.",
    "Do not remember me as a bridge nor a roof",
    "as the maker of legends",
    "nor as a trap",
    "door to that world",
    "where black and white clericals",
    "hang on the edge of beauty in five oclock elevators",
    "twitching their shoulders to avoid other flesh",
    "and now",
    "there is someone to speak for them",
    "moving away from me into tomorrows",
    "morning of wish and ripen",
    "your goodbye is a promise of lightning",
    "in the last angels hand",
    "unwelcome and warning",
    "the sands have run out against us",
    "we were rewarded by journeys",
    "away from each other",
    "into desire",
    "into mornings alone",
    "where excuse and endurance mingle",
    "conceiving decision.",
    "Do not remember me",
    "as disaster",
    "nor as the keeper of secrets",
    "I am a fellow rider in the cattle cars",
    "watching",
    "you move slowly out of my bed",
    "saying we cannot waste time",
    "only ourselves."
