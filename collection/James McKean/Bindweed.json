    "There is little I can do",
    "besides stoop to pluck them",
    "one by one from the ground,",
    "their roots all weak links,",
    "this hoard of Lazaruses popping up",
    "at night, not the Heavenly Blue",
    "so like silk handkerchiefs,",
    "nor the Giant White so timid",
    "in the face of the moon,",
    "but poor relations who visit",
    "then stay. They sleep in my garden.",
    "Each morning I evict them.",
    "Each night more arrive, their leaves",
    "small, green shrouds,",
    "reminding me the mother root",
    "waits deep underground",
    "and I dig but will never find her",
    "and her children will inherit",
    "all that I\u2019ve cleared",
    "when she holds me tighter",
    "and tighter in her arms."
