    "The gaunt thing",
    "with no organs",
    "creeps along the streets",
    "of Europe, she will",
    "commute, in her feathered bat stomach-gown",
    "with no organs",
    "with sores on her insides",
    "even her head",
    "a vast puschamber",
    "of pus(sy) memories",
    "with no organs",
    "nothing to make babies",
    "she will be the great witch of euro-american legend",
    "who sucked the life",
    "from some unknown nigger",
    "whose name will be known",
    "but whose substance will not ever",
    "not even by him",
    "who is dead in a pile of dopeskin",
    "This bitch killed a friend of mine named Bob Thompson",
    "a black painter, a giant, once, she reduced",
    "to a pitiful imitation faggot",
    "full of American holes and a monkey on his back",
    "slapped airplanes",
    "from the empire state building",
    "May this bitch and her sisters, all of them,",
    "receive my words",
    "in all their orifices like lye mixed with",
    "cocola and alaga syrup",
    "feel this shit, bitches, feel it, now laugh your",
    "hysterectic laughs",
    "while your flesh burns",
    "and your eyes peel to red mud"
