    "(Half-screamer",
    "in dull tones",
    "of another forest.",
    "Respecter of power. That it transform, and enlarge",
    "Hierarchy crawls over earth (change exalting space",
    "Dried mud to mountain, cape and whip, swirled",
    "Walkers, and riders and flyers.",
    "Language spread into darkness. Be Vowel",
    "and value",
    "Consonant",
    "and direction.",
    "Rather the lust of the thing",
    "than across to droop at its energies. In melted snows",
    "the leather cracks, and pure men claw at their bodies.",
    "Women laugh delicately, delicately rubbing their thighs.",
    "And the dead king laughs, looking out the hole",
    "in his tomb. Seeing the poor",
    "singing his evil songs."
