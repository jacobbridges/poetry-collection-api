    "A long time have I known you... Why,",
    "Full eighteen years, I must confess!",
    "All pink are you; pale, blear am I.",
    "Winters, mine; yours, spring\u2019s comeliness!",
    "White cemetery lilacs sprout",
    "Over my temples; but soon, now,",
    "The grove entire will bloom about",
    "My head, to shade my withered brow.",
    "Pallid, my sun sinks low, and will",
    "Soon fade on the horizon\u2019s face;",
    "And on the mournful, doleful hill",
    "I see my final dwelling-place.",
    "Oh! May you from your lips let fall",
    "A kiss, too long delayed, upon",
    "My own, so that beneath my pall",
    "I may rest, heart at peace, anon..."
