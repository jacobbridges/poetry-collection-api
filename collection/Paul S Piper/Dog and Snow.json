    "Dog sees white. Arctic",
    "light, the bright buzz in the brain",
    "of pure crystal adrenaline. In a flash",
    "he is out the door and across the street",
    "looking for snowshoe hares, caribou, cats.",
    "His wild ancestry ignited, Dog plunges",
    "his nose into snow up to his eyes. He sees",
    "his dreams. Master yells from the front porch",
    "but Dog can\u2019t hear him. Dog hears nothing",
    "except the roar of the wind across the tundra, the ancient",
    "existential cry of wolves, pure, devastating, hungry.",
    "Time for crunchies. Taking many detours, Dog",
    "returns to the porch. Let master think what he",
    "wants. Freedom comes at a price."
