    "I have become the smaller flag on a ship,",
    "the shorter rafters of a roof, a knave",
    "in a pack of cards. I wear a skimpy coat,",
    "tall leather boot, and leather drinking flask.",
    "I am captured in a child's game",
    "and hit when grown men gamble.",
    "I am what they call a tame ape.",
    "I was a common man",
    "whose job was to lift weight.",
    "Mechanical devices that replaced",
    "my muscles took my job and pay",
    "and more\u2014they took my human name.",
    "And I, who used to pull",
    "my master's boots, hoist meat",
    "and turn the spit, work the roller",
    "and the winch, climb the steeple,",
    "strike the bell and connect lines",
    "in telephone exchange, am a daw,",
    "the tiniest of crows, gathering",
    "loose sticks to nest in castle ruins.",
    "The solace of six centuries\u2014and still\u2014",
    "is once, on a high and windy hill,",
    "beside a well that was clear and full,",
    "I kissed a girl named Gylle."
