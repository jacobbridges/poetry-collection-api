    "He doesn\u2019t hate cops",
    "He merely has no use for them",

    "his picture taken",
    "for Victor Records",
    "listening for",
    "His Master\u2019s Voice",
    "and looking",
    "like a living questionmark",

    "of puzzling existence",
    "with its wondrous hollow horn",
    "which always seems",
    "just about to spout forth",
    "some Victorious answer",
    "to everything"
