    "People getting divorced",
    "riding around with their clothes in the car",
    "and wondering what happened",
    "to everyone and everything",
    "including their other",
    "pair of shoes",
    "And if you spy one",
    "then who knows what happened",
    "to the other",
    "with tongue alack",
    "and years later not even knowing",
    "if the other ever",
    "found a mate",
    "without splitting the seams",
    "or remained intact",
    "unlaced",
    "and the sole",
    "ah the soul",
    "a curious conception",
    "hanging on somehow",
    "to walk again",
    "in the free air",
    "once the heel",
    "has been replaced"
