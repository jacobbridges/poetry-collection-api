    "The wheels' endless round",
    "The rivers, streaming to ground",
    "The road. . .",
    "Oh the heavenly the Gypsy the early dawn light",
    "Remember the breeze in the morning, the steppe silver-bright",
    "Wisps of blue smoke from the rise",
    "And the song of the wise",
    "Gypsy czar. . .",
    "In the dark midnight, under the ancient trees' shroud",
    "We gave you sons as perfect as night, sons",
    "As poor as the night",
    "And the nightingale chirred",
    "Your might. . .",
    "We never stopped you, companions for marvelous hours",
    "Poverty's passions, the impoverished meals we shared",
    "The fierce bonfire's glow",
    "And there, on the carpet below,",
    "Fell stars. . ."
