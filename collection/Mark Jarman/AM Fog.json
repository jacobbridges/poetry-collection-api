    "Night\u2019s afterbirth, last dream before waking,",
    "Holding on with dissolving hands,",
    "Out of it came, not a line of old men,",
    "But pairs of headlights, delaying morning.",
    "It felt like tears, like wetted bedsheets,",
    "And suspended in it like a medicine",
    "In vapor was the ocean\u2019s presence, ghost",
    "Of deep water and the bite of salt.",
    "Here you found your body again,",
    "The hand before your face and the face it touched,",
    "Eyes floating, feet on invisible ground,",
    "Vagueness like another skin.",
    "Sent out into it anyway, because it was morning,",
    "To taste it, touch blind hardness",
    "Like marble ruins, and skirt the edges,",
    "Razors in goosedown, hydrants\u2019 fists.",
    "Abruptly out of it waves appeared,",
    "Transmuted from hanging silver ore, crafted",
    "Before the eyes into curving metals",
    "That broke into soup scum, Queen Anne\u2019s lace.",
    "Out of a great nothing, a theology.",
    "Out of the amorphous, an edgeless body",
    "Or one like a hunting mass of tendrils",
    "That hurried down the sand, moved by hunger.",
    "I remember a gang of friends",
    "Racing a fog bank\u2019s onslaught along the beach.",
    "Seal-slick, warm from the sun",
    "This thing would eat, they ran laughing.",
    "The fog came on. And they were beautiful,",
    "The three boys and one girl, still in her wetsuit,",
    "And the dissolution overtaking them,",
    "Their stridency, full of faith, still audible.",
    "All morning bathed in a dovelike brooding.",
    "The fog satisfied itself by overwhelming",
    "The meagre dew, watering the doors",
    "0f snails, the leeward mold, and held still.",
    "And then near noon there was a concentration",
    "As if the sky tried to find a slippery word",
    "Or remember\u2014",
    "\u2014remember",
    "Where it was in an unfamiliar bedroom.",
    "And knew. And switched the light on. Wide awake."
