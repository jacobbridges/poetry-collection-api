    "The children are hiding among the raspberry canes.",
    "They look big to one another, the garden small.",
    "Already in their mouths this soft fruit",
    "That lasts so briefly in the supermarket",
    "Tastes like the past. The gritty wall,",
    "Behind the veil of leaves, is hollow.",
    "There are yellow wasps inside it. The children know.",
    "They know the wall is hard, although it hums.",
    "They know a lot and will not forget it soon.",
    "When did we forget? But we were never",
    "Children, never found where they were hiding",
    "And hid with them, never followed",
    "The wasp down into its nest",
    "With a fingertip that still tingles.",
    "We lie in bed at night, thinking about",
    "The future, always the future, always forgetting",
    "That it will be the past, hard and hollow,",
    "Veiled and humming, soon enough."
