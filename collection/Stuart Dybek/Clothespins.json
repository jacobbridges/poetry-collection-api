    "I once hit clothespins",
    "for the Chicago Cubs.",
    "I'd go out after supper",

    "from under four stories",
    "of clothesline.",
    "A swing-and-a-miss",
    "was a strike-out;",
    "the garage roof, Willie Mays,",
    "pounding his mitt",
    "under a pop fly.",
    "Bushes, a double,",
    "off the fence, triple,",
    "and over, home run.",
    "The bleachers roared.",
    "I was all they ever needed for the flag.",
    "New records every game\u2014",
    "once, 10 homers in a row!",
    "But sometimes I'd tag them",
    "so hard they'd explode,",
    "legs flying apart in midair,",
    "pieces spinning crazily",
    "in all directions.",
    "Foul Ball! What else",
    "could I call it?",
    "The bat was real."
