    "Often visitors there, saddened",
    "by lack of trees, go out",
    "to a promontory.",
    "Then, backed by the banded",
    "sunset, the trail",
    "of the Conquistadores,",
    "the father puts on the camera,",
    "the leather albatross,",
    "and has the children",
    "imitate saguaros. One",
    "at a time they stand there smiling,",
    "fingers up like the tines of a fork",
    "while the stately saguaro",
    "goes on being entered",
    "by wrens, diseases, and sunlight.",
    "The mother sits on a rock,",
    "arms folded",
    "across her breasts. To her",
    "the cactus looks scared,",
    "its needles",
    "like hair in cartoons.",
    "With its arms in preacher",
    "or waltz position,",
    "it gives the impression",
    "of great effort",
    "in every direction,",
    "like the mother.",
    "Thousands of these gray-green",
    "cacti cross the valley:",
    "nature repeating itself,",
    "children repeating nature,",
    "father repeating children",
    "and mother watching.",
    "Later, the children think",
    "the cactus was moral,",
    "had something to teach them,",
    "some survival technique",
    "or just regular beauty.",
    "But what else could it do?",
    "The only protection",
    "against death",
    "was to love solitude."
