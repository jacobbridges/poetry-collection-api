    "In movies when the hero is about to die,",
    "He scatters a few phrases in a place like this,",
    "Hoping the words will come up again",
    "Immortal, or the grasses will reach out for him",
    "As now they do for us.",
    "Someone has planted a row of little trees",
    "To stop the wind. Instead they\u2019ve learned",
    "To bend like the elect",
    "In one direction only; they know",
    "The sea will shatter them.",
    "Isn\u2019t it always like this?",
    "Something uncontrollable becomes the hero,",
    "Taking off its dress, the ice plants",
    "Sunburn from the center out",
    "So we can see that their deaths",
    "Of splendid rust and yellow are not ours,",
    "We are allowed again the glare",
    "Of the sand, the druid hills,",
    "The grasses brushing the legs, though",
    "Just to have felt it once would have been enough."
