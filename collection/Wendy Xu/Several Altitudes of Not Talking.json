    "You are part of other people but not",
    "like them. You live in a little wooden box",
    "and wake up with your face",
    "in your palm and some sunlight.",
    "Which is a sign of resignation but not",
    "for you. Which is part of what I meant",
    "by trying to effect change",
    "in myself and also talking. By describing",
    "to you that before a city can become",
    "spectacular its buildings must put on",
    "an iron gown. And then some workers",
    "climb all around it. And it is like having",
    "no teeth because you are waiting",
    "for better teeth. I tell you I am very attached",
    "to my old teeth. In a game called",
    "I did not once slide",
    "my teeth across the table. I do not",

    "making demands with wild",
    "gesticulations. I thought about maybe",
    "trying to sharpen my knowledge",
    "of jokes. I thought about really",
    "needing a hug. A very important car",
    "with sirens rumbled by and sounded",
    "exactly right."
