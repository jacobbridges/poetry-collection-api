    "Today there has been so much talk of things exploding",
    "into other things, so much that we all become curious, that we",
    "all run outside into the hot streets",
    "and hug. Romance is a grotto of eager stones",
    "anticipating light, or a girl whose teeth",
    "you can always see. With more sparkle and pop",
    "is the only way to live. Your confetti tongue explodes",
    "into acid jazz. Small typewriters",
    "that other people keep in their eyes",
    "click away at all our farewell parties. It is hard",
    "to pack for the rest of your life. Someone is always",
    "eating cold cucumber noodles. Someone will drop by later",
    "to help dismantle some furniture. A lot can go wrong",
    "if you sleep or think, but the trees go on waving",
    "their broken little hands."
