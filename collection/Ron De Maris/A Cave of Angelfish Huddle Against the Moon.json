    "Put an ear to the light at fall",
    "of dark and you will hear",
    "nothing. This pale luminescence",
    "that drifts in upon them",
    "makes a blue bole of their caves,",
    "a scare of their scything",
    "tails. They tell",
    "in the bubbling dark of images",
    "that come in upon them",
    "when light spreads like an oil slick",
    "and sea fans",
    "that once were their refuge",
    "turn away.",
    "Now there is no dark",
    "dark enough for their silver tails,",
    "scatter of color",
    "(like coins massively",
    "piling in the lap of a miser)",
    "that was, in the day, their pride.",
    "This is their song",
    "in the silting",
    "drift of the reef.",
    "They have never seen the moon",
    "nor the black scut of night, stars",
    "spread like plankton",
    "in their beastly infinities."
