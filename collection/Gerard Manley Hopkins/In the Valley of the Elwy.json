    "I remember a house where all were good",
    "To me, God knows, deserving no such thing:",
    "Comforting smell breathed at very entering,",
    "Fetched fresh, as I suppose, off some sweet wood.",
    "That cordial air made those kind people a hood",
    "All over, as a bevy of eggs the mothering wing",
    "Will, or mild nights the new morsels of Spring:",
    "Why, it seemed of course; seemed of right it should.",
    "Lovely the woods, waters, meadows, combes, vales,",
    "All the air things wear that build this world of Wales;",
    "Only the inmate does not correspond:",
    "God, lover of souls, swaying considerate scales,",
    "Complete thy creature dear O where it fails,",
    "Being mighty a master, being a father and fond."
