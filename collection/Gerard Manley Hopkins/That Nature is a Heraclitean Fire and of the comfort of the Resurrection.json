    "Cloud-puffball, torn tufts, tossed pillows | flaunt forth, then chevy on an air-",
    "Built thoroughfare: heaven-roysterers, in gay-gangs | they throng; they glitter in marches.",
    "Down roughcast, down dazzling whitewash, | wherever an elm arches,",
    "Shivelights and shadowtackle \u00edn long | lashes lace, lance, and pair.",
    "Delightfully the bright wind boisterous | ropes, wrestles, beats earth bare",
    "Of yestertempest's creases; | in pool and rut peel parches",
    "Squandering ooze to squeezed | dough, crust, dust; stanches, starches",
    "Squadroned masks and manmarks | treadmire toil there",
    "Footfretted in it. Million-fuel\u00e8d, | nature's bonfire burns on.",
    "But quench her bonniest, dearest | to her, her clearest-selv\u00e8d spark",
    "Man, how fast his firedint, | his mark on mind, is gone!",
    "Both are in an unfathomable, all is in an enormous dark",
    "Drowned. O pity and indig | nation! Manshape, that shone",
    "Sheer off, disseveral, a star, | death blots black out; nor mark",
    "Is any of him at all so stark",
    "But vastness blurs and time | beats level. Enough! the Resurrection,",
    "A heart's-clarion! Away grief's gasping, | joyless days, dejection.",
    "Across my foundering deck shone",
    "A beacon, an eternal beam. | Flesh fade, and mortal trash",
    "Fall to the residuary worm; | world's wildfire, leave but ash:",
    "In a flash, at a trumpet crash,",
    "I am all at once what Christ is, | since he was what I am, and",
    "This Jack, joke, poor potsherd, | patch, matchwood, immortal diamond,",
    "Is immortal diamond."
