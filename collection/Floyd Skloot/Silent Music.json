    "My wife wears headphones as she plays",
    "Chopin etudes in the winter light.",
    "Singing random notes, she sways",
    "in and out of shadow while night",
    "settles. The keys she presses make a soft",
    "clack, the bench creaks when her weight shifts,",
    "golden cotton fabric ripples across",
    "her shoulders, and the sustain pedal clicks.",
    "This is the hidden melody I know",
    "so well, her body finding harmony in",
    "the give and take of motion, her lyric",
    "grace of gesture measured against a slow",
    "fall of darkness. Now stillness descends",
    "to signal the end of her silent music."
