    "Long time a child, and still a child, when years",
    "Had painted manhood on my cheek, was I,\u2014",
    "For yet I lived like one not born to die;",
    "A thriftless prodigal of smiles and tears,",
    "No hope I needed, and I knew no fears.",
    "But sleep, though sweet, is only sleep, and waking,",
    "I waked to sleep no more, at once o\u2019ertaking",
    "The vanguard of my age, with all arrears",
    "Of duty on my back. Nor child, nor man,",
    "Nor youth, nor sage, I find my head is grey,",
    "For I have lost the race I never ran:",
    "A rathe December blights my lagging May;",
    "And still I am a child, tho\u2019 I be old,",
    "Time is my debtor for my years untold."
