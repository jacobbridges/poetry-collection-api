    "Like a loose island on the wide expanse,",
    "Unconscious floating on the fickle sea,",
    "Herself her all, she lives in privacy;",
    "Her waking life as lonely as a trance,",
    "Doom\u2019d to behold the universal dance,",
    "And never hear the music which expounds",
    "The solemn step, coy slide, the merry bounds.",
    "The vague, mute language of the countenance.",
    "In vain for her I smooth my antic rhyme;",
    "She cannot hear it. All her little being",
    "Concentrated in her solitary seeing\u2014",
    "What can she know of beauty or sublime?",
    "And yet methinks she looks so calm and good,",
    "God must be with her in her solitude!"
