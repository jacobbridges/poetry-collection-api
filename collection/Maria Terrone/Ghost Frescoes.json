    "from the landscape of human affairs.",

    "seems to straddle acres, beaming",
    "casual self-possession, the divine",

    "in the space between",
    "both legs, a third intrudes,",
    "last remnant of a man fading",
    "to white dust. Nine hundred years ago",
    "this wall was his. Reduced",
    "to a toehold, he now spites",
    "the fourteenth-century arriviste,",
    "holding his ground with the ghost",
    "of what he was. The saint remains",
    "oblivious. Centuries sweep",

    "from a sun shower",
    "who's arrived dripping wet, an idea",
    "fresh from the brush of his maker."
