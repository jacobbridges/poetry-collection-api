    "There is no warning rattle at the door",
    "nor heavy feet to stomp the foyer boards.",
    "Safe in the dark prison, I know that",
    "light slides over",
    "the fingered work of a toothless",
    "woman in Pakistan.",
    "Happy prints of",
    "an invisible time are illumined.",
    "My mouth agape",
    "rejects the solid air and",
    "lungs hold. The invader takes",
    "direction and",
    "seeps through the plaster walls.",
    "It is at my chamber, entering",
    "the keyhole, pushing",
    "through the padding of the door.",
    "I cannot scream. A bone",
    "of fear clogs my throat.",
    "It is upon me. It is",
    "sunrise, with Hope",
    "its arrogant rider.",
    "My mind, formerly quiescent",
    "in its snug encasement, is strained",
    "to look upon their rapturous visages,",
    "to let them enter even into me.",
    "I am forced",
    "outside myself to",
    "mount the light and ride joined with Hope.",
    "Through all the bright hours",
    "I cling to expectation, until",
    "darkness comes to reclaim me",
    "as its own. Hope fades, day is gone",
    "into its irredeemable place",
    "and I am thrown back into the familiar",
    "bonds of disconsolation.",
    "Gloom crawls around",
    "lapping lasciviously",
    "between my toes, at my ankles,",
    "and it sucks the strands of my",
    "hair. It forgives my heady",
    "fling with Hope. I am",
    "joined again into its",
    "greedy arms."
