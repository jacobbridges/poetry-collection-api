    "We were entwined in red rings",
    "Of blood and loneliness before",
    "The first snows fell",
    "Before muddy rivers seeded clouds",
    "Above a virgin forest, and",
    "Men ran naked, blue and black",
    "Skinned into the warm embraces",
    "Of Sheba, Eve and Lilith.",
    "I was your sister.",
    "You left me to force strangers",
    "Into brother molds, exacting",
    "Taxations they never",
    "Owed or could ever pay.",
    "You fought to die, thinking",
    "In destruction lies the seed",
    "Of birth. You may be right.",
    "I will remember silent walks in",
    "Southern woods and long talks",
    "In low voices",
    "Shielding meaning from the big ears",
    "Of overcurious adults.",
    "You may be right.",
    "Your slow return from",
    "Regions of terror and bloody",
    "Screams, races my heart.",
    "I hear again the laughter",
    "Of children and see fireflies",
    "Bursting tiny explosions in",
    "An Arkansas twilight."
