    "The eye follows, the land",
    "Slips upward, creases down, forms",
    "The gentle buttocks of a young",
    "Giant. In the nestle,",
    "Old adobe bricks, washed of",
    "Whiteness, paled to umber,",
    "Await another century.",
    "Star Jasmine and old vines",
    "Lay claim upon the ghosted land,",
    "Then quiet pools whisper",
    "Private childhood secrets.",
    "Flush on inner cottage walls",
    "Antiquitous faces,",
    "Used to the gelid breath",
    "Of old manors, glare disdainfully",
    "Over breached time.",
    "Around and through these",
    "Cold phantasmatalities,",
    "He walks, insisting",
    "To the languid air,",
    "Activity, music,",
    "A generosity of graces.",
    "His lupin fields spurn old",
    "Deceit and agile poppies dance",
    "In golden riot. Each day is",
    "Fulminant, exploding brightly",
    "Under the gaze of his exquisite",
    "Sires, frozen in the famed paint",
    "Of dead masters. Audacious",
    "Sunlight casts defiance",
    "At their feet."
