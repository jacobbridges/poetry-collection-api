    "the difference between a cigarette holder",
    "and cigarette case,",
    "the pleasure of a lorgnette over spectacles,",
    "of a fortnight over",
    "two weeks, of a spiral over graduated stairs,",
    "of the frisson of crying",
    "like pouty boys, and of the way to walk a lobster",
    "on a leash: drag it,",
    "its exoskeleton rapping on the cobbles",
    "through the rabble",
    "of Montparnasse, as if lugging luggage.",
    "We did what could not",
    "gain us a week of rent or even a plate of fish,",
    "yet we managed to eat",
    "sickening amounts, to hate on our patroness,",
    "the Princess de Polignac,",
    "though, and I am sorry, she had bought us wine.",
    "Once, in the chamber",
    "before an evening concert, I hid a sack of bees",
    "in the white baby grand,",
    "and when ball-gowned Polignac raised the leaf",
    "they swarmed through the strings",
    "to the chandelier and the Princess saw a living sun",
    "and felt a little less dreary",
    "and a little less proud of being bored."
