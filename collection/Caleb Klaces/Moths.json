    "A translator who has a phobia of moths",
    "spent three years translating a book with a moth motif.",
    "It\u2019s ironic, she has said, that she knew more about the moths",
    "than the author of the original, who was merely fascinated.",
    "The translation contained a greater variety of moths than the original,",
    "drawn from suggestions she had made, some of which were in fact",
    "too perfect and changed back before it went to print.",
    "Her moths, the ones that were too aptly named,",
    "meant too much, her moths that she hated, where are they now?",
    "The same place as all the versions of people",
    "that have been undressed and slept with, in lieu of the people",
    "themselves, by others. That must include a version",
    "of almost everyone, lots of versions of some people,",
    "some only a flutter, animated then decided against."
