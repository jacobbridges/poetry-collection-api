    "It wasn't our battalion, but we lay alongside it,",
    "So the story is as true as the telling is frank.",
    "They hadn't one Line-officer left, after Arras,",
    "Except a batty major and the Colonel, who drank.",
    "'B' Company Commander was fresh from the Depot,",
    "An expert on gas drill, otherwise a dud;",
    "So Sergeant-Major Money carried on, as instructed,",
    "And that's where the swaddies began to sweat blood.",
    "His Old Army humour was so well-spiced and hearty",
    "That one poor sod shot himself, and one lost his wits;",
    "But discipline's maintained, and back in rest-billets",
    "The Colonel congratulates 'B' Company on their kits.",
    "The subalterns went easy, as was only natural",
    "With a terror like Money driving the machine,",
    "Till finally two Welshmen, butties from the Rhondda,",
    "Bayoneted their bugbear in a field-canteen.",
    "Well, we couldn't blame the officers, they relied on Money;",
    "We couldn't blame the pitboys, their courage was grand;",
    "Or, least of all, blame Money, an old stiff surviving",
    "In a New (bloody) Army he couldn't understand."
