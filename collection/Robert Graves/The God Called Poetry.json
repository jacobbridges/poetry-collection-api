    "Now I begin to know at last,",
    "These nights when I sit down to rhyme,",
    "The form and measure of that vast",
    "God we call Poetry, he who stoops",
    "And leaps me through his paper hoops",
    "A little higher every time.",
    "Tempts me to think I\u2019ll grow a proper",
    "Singing cricket or grass-hopper",
    "Making prodigious jumps in air",
    "While shaken crowds about me stare",
    "Aghast, and I sing, growing bolder",
    "To fly up on my master\u2019s shoulder",
    "Rustling the thick stands of his hair.",
    "He is older than the seas,",
    "Older than the plains and hills,",
    "And older than the light that spills",
    "From the sun\u2019s hot wheel on these.",
    "He wakes the gale that tears your trees,",
    "He sings to you from window sills.",
    "At you he roars, or he will coo,",
    "He shouts and screams when hell is hot,",
    "Riding on the shell and shot.",
    "He smites you down, he succours you,",
    "And where you seek him, he is not.",
    "To-day I see he has two heads",
    "Like Janus\u2014calm, benignant, this;",
    "That, grim and scowling: his beard spreads",
    "From chin to chin: this god has power",
    "Immeasurable at every hour:",
    "He first taight lovers how to kiss,",
    "He brings down sunshine after shower,",
    "Thunder and hate are his also,",
    "He is YES and he is NO.",
    "The black beard spoke and said to me,",
    "\u2018Human fraility though you be,",
    "Yet shout and crack your whip, be harsh!",
    "They\u2019ll obey you in the end:",
    "Hill and field, river and marsh",
    "Shall obey you, hop and skip",
    "At the terrour of your whip,",
    "To your gales of anger bend.\u2019",
    "The pale beard spoke and said in turn",
    "\u2018True: a prize goes to the stern,",
    "But sing and laugh and easily run",
    "Through the wide airs of my plain,",
    "Bathe in my waters, drink my sun,",
    "And draw my creatures with soft song;",
    "They shall follow you along",
    "Graciously with no doubt or pain.\u2019",
    "Then speaking from his double head",
    "The glorious fearful monster said",
    "\u2018I am YES and I am NO,",
    "Black as pitch and white as snow,",
    "Love me, hate me, reconcile",
    "Hate with love, perfect with vile,",
    "So equal justice shall be done",
    "And life shared between moon and sun.",
    "Nature for you shall curse or smile:",
    "A poet you shall be, my son.\u2019"
