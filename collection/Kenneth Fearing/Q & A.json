    "Where analgesia may be found to ease the infinite, minute scars of the day;",
    "What final interlude will result, picked bit by bit from the morning's hurry, the lunch-hour boredom, the fevers of the night;",
    "Why this one is cherished by the gods, and that one not;",
    "How to win, and win again, and again, staking wit alone against a sea of time;",
    "Which man to trust and, once found, how far\u2014",
    "Will not be found in Matthew, Mark, Luke, or John,",
    "Nor Blackstone, nor Gray's, nor Dun & Bradstreet, nor Freud, nor Marx,",
    "Nor the sage of the evening news, nor the corner astrologist, nor in any poet,",
    "Nor what sort of laughter should greet the paid pronouncements of the great,",
    "Nor what pleasure the mulitudes have, brining lunch and the children to watch the condemned to be plunged into death,",
    "Nor why the sun should rise tomorrow,",
    "Nor how the moon still weaves upon the ground, through the leaves, so much silence and so much peace."
