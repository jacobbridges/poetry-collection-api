    "I",
    "Every day it is the same.",
    "He comes home.",
    "He tells her about it.",
    "As he speaks, his breath condenses in front of his face.",
    "She goes about her business;",
    "every now and then she looks over.",
    "She doesn\u2019t hear his voice.",
    "She sees the soft fog that continues to form a halo.",
    "She knows he is still talking about that place.",
    "He never tires of it like she does.",
    "Only on summer days when the air is hot",
    "and moisture is still a long time in coming,",
    "she asks him to tell her about that place.",
    "She sits facing him.",
    "Waiting for the first vocalic, non-stops,",
    "the push of air from his lips.",
    "He tells her of the place where clouds are formed.",
    "The cool dampness of his voice is rich.",
    "Even on a dry June day",
    "her face beads with wetness",
    "as he talks directly to her.",
    "Each aspirated sound a gentle burst of coolness.",
    "\u201cTell me again, tell me again,\u201d she teases.",
    "If he knew she only wanted relief from the heat",
    "and not the story, he would stop talking.",
    "He begins, \u201cThe first time I saw the place",
    "where clouds are formed was from",
    "the window of a train . . .\u201d",
    "Another time was in a mirage",
    "in the heat outside Tucson.",
    "Once he thought he saw it",
    "in the dry light of stars.",
    "The place he remembers best",
    "was when he saw it in the eyes",
    "of a woman he spoke to.",
    "When he first noticed it,",
    "she hid it by lowering her gaze.",
    "Soon she let him look freely.",
    "There were times when she opened her eyes",
    "wide, allowing an unobscured view.",
    "Sometimes he saw her eyes smolder",
    "with dryness on a summer day.",
    "Other times she was rich with moisture.",
    "Clouds came in succession.",
    "The earth\u2019s shadows muted.",
    "\u201cYou know the forty days",
    "and forty nights?",
    "I was there.",
    "I\u2019ll be there when it happens again,\u201d",
    "she said with a slight smile.",
    "Like a child, he rushed to look",
    "into her eyes at every opportunity.",
    "If he could, he would hang on her eye socket,",
    "peering inside,",
    "marveling at her displays.",
    "II",
    "An unusually cold December day right around Christmas;",
    "clouds, mist find solace in the canyons of the Santa Catalina Mountains.",
    "White moisture quietly moving amid the cactus.",
    "Truly, clouds, wind, and rain are the few elements",
    "that can touch the saguaro from head to foot.",
    "Oblivious of spines, needles.",
    "Rubbery hide surrounded, soothed by elements.",
    "Contact triggers stored heat of remembered summers.",
    "Moisture beads roll forward, unstoppable.",
    "From the city below",
    "we see mist rising, mist rising.",
    "III",
    "We sit close in the cab of the truck.",
    "The weather is cold, wet outside.",
    "Too messy to stand in",
    "waiting for a school bus.",
    "My father\u2019s truck is warm inside,",
    "having been at work since four a.m.",
    "The sound of the engine is soothing,",
    "heater working to capacity.",
    "Inside the cab we are silent.",
    "We don\u2019t need language.",
    "We listen to the regular hum of the engine,",
    "rhythm of the windshield wipers,",
    "soft rain on the hood.",
    "Aware of the cold air",
    "surrounding our temporary shelter.",
    "We look out over the fields",
    "where fog clings to the soil.",
    "Every now and then",
    "with the back of his gloved hand",
    "he wipes the windshield.",
    "\u201cIs it coming yet?\u201d",
    "The three of us sit quietly,",
    "breathing clouds.",
    "Clouds condense as",
    "they contact the coolness of the windows.",
    "My father appears to breathe air",
    "with temperature in balance.",
    "He forms no clouds.",
    "He watches us.",
    "We continue to breathe",
    "gray, soft mist, waiting for the school bus."
