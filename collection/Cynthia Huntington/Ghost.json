    "At first you didn\u2019t know me.",
    "I was a shape moving rapidly, nervous",
    "at the edge of your vision. A flat, high voice,",
    "dark slash of hair across my cheekbone.",
    "I made myself present, though never distinct.",
    "Things I said that he repeated, a tone",
    "you could hear, but never trace, in his voice.",
    "Silence\u2014followed by talk of other things.",
    "When you would sit at your desk, I would creep",
    "near you like a question. A thought would scurry",
    "across the front of your mind. I\u2019d be there,",
    "ducking out of sight. You must have felt me",
    "watching you, my small eyes fixed on your face,",
    "the smile you wondered at, on the lips only.",
    "The voice on the phone, quick and full of business.",
    "All that you saw and heard and could not find",
    "the center of, those days growing into years,",
    "growing inside of you, out of reach, now with you",
    "forever, in your house, in your garden, in corridors",
    "of dream where I finally tell you my name."
