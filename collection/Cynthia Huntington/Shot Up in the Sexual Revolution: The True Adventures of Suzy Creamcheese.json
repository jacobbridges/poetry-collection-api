    "1.",
    "After twenty I stopped counting,",
    "not like my friend Beverly, who sewed",
    "an embroidered satin star on her bell-bottoms",
    "for every new guy she fucked.",
    "She had them running down both legs",
    "and around the billowing hem,",
    "and was starting up the inseam",
    "when the jeans gave out in the wash.",
    "It was a boys\u2019 game anyway, those years",
    "of our extended homage to the penis:",
    "the guitar playing the penis, drums saluting it,",
    "cock rock, Molotov cocktail, the motorcycle",
    "gripped between the thighs, and I went down,",
    "we all went down, in the old cultural disaster",
    "of idol worship\u2014a thousand-year bender.",
    "Only this time it was the adolescent member,",
    "oiled and laved, thrust forward arcing,",
    "thin with ache, all tight flesh poked upward,",
    "claiming its own. How it came and went,",
    "penetrating but never settling down,",
    "and how often we were caused to admire it:",
    "hairless sweet warrior, raider against the State.",
    "But I have this sweet pink flower",
    "here between my legs\u2014I put my hand down and touch it,",
    "still soft and wet, and many-folded, endlessly opening,",
    "hiding, seeking, hidden and sought,",
    "but never very much admired or even smiled on",
    "in those years, never served much less sung to.",
    "Not a garden then but a citadel,",
    "a wall to be breached, a new land claimed,",
    "but linger there? No, I would say",
    "there was an overall lack of appreciation,",
    "though breasts were well respected, slopping loose",
    "under T-shirts like little animals,",
    "and I would feel my nipples brush the cotton",
    "with pleasure, see them regarded also with pleasure.",
    "Still, sex then was a taking, like spoils of war, a victory",
    "over all those straight fucks back home, marooned",
    "in the dismal suburbs that birthed us squalling and red",
    "and watched us flee in ungrateful cars down night highways.",
    "And God knows it felt good those nights.",
    "I was ready, it was ready, to open and answer the call.",
    "And take me down and roll me over, yes, and give",
    "it to me\u2014but why all this riding away afterward?",
    "Where was everyone going",
    "and why didn\u2019t I get to ride along? Who knew at first",
    "nothing had changed, just wanting the thrust and tug",
    "and slam up against the headboard, I should say so,",
    "but left still wanting more, wanting to leap",
    "out of centuries\u2019 shame and be something new,",
    "not this old consolation of women for the powerless,",
    "some kind of cosmic door prize awarded",
    "just for showing up with a dick,",
    "some proof to themselves these boys were men.",
    "\u201cYou\u2019re good,\u201d he said. Hell, I wasn\u2019t taking a typing test,",
    "I was fighting to live in a dying world.",
    "I was throwing myself away, an offering to wildest space,",
    "surrender to the mind\u2019s dissolve, the body\u2019s electric light,",
    "nerve endings firing like exploding stars.",
    "\u201cYou\u2019re good,\u201d they all said:",
    "you\u2019d think somebody was doing a survey.",
    "Girls say yes to boys who say no, and then",
    "your professor asks if you\u2019re wearing underwear,",
    "when you meet for your conference on the poetry of Yeats.",
    "Crossing the border after midnight in a borrowed car",
    "after a visit to the after-hours doctor\u2019s office in Sarnia.",
    "Nodding out in the back seat, pills wearing off.",
    "He was a legend among undergraduates:",
    "cheap and reliable, always on call,",
    "until a month later the headlines screamed",
    "\u201cAbortion Doc!\u201d when a girl died in his office",
    "and he dragged her down to the river",
    "and dumped her body in the underbrush."
