    "The terrible sons of the mighty race",
    "Shout in thunder the Lord is King,",

    "Flame to the world that the Lord was King,",
    "And seraphs whose stature is one with Space,",
    "Proclaim that the Lord shall be King for ever.",
    "The Lord is King, the Lord was King, the Lord shall be King for ever and ever.",
    "The rushing and undulant sons of fire",
    "Fiercely cry that the Lord is King,",
    "The rustling legions with harp and lyre",
    "Sweetly tell that the Lord was King,",
    "And numberless creatures in ceaseless choir",
    "Chant that the Lord shall be King for ever.",
    "The Lord is King, the Lord was King, the Lord shall be King for ever and ever.",
    "The bards who remember the songs of yore",
    "Sing aloud that the Lord is King,",
    "The sages enshrouded in mystic lore",

    "And rulers of spans of the heavenly floor",
    "Cry that the Lord shall be King for ever.",
    "The Lord is King, the Lord was King, the Lord shall be King for ever and ever.",
    "The heirs of the Torah, Thy rich bequest,",
    "Chant in joy that the Lord is King,",

    "And angels in fiery garments drest",
    "Repeat that the Lord shall be King for ever.",
    "The Lord is King, the Lord was King, the Lord shall be King for ever and ever.",
    "Mellifluous orators trained of tongue",
    "Preach and teach that the Lord is King,",
    "The shimmering cherubim, radiant, young,",
    "Trumpet exultant the Lord was King,",
    "And seraphim circling have ever sung",
    "The song that the Lord shall be King for ever.",
    "The Lord is King, the Lord was King, the Lord shall be King for ever and ever.",
    "Thy people in passionate worship cry",
    "One to another the Lord is King.",
    "In awe of the marvels beneath the sky",
    "Each explains that the Lord was King.",
    "One sound from Thy pastures ascends on high:",
    "The chant that the Lord shall be King for ever.",
    "The Lord is King, the Lord was King, the Lord shall be King for ever and ever.",
    "Assemblies of holiness consecrate",
    "Thee with the cry that the Lord is King,",
    "Innumerous myriads iterate",

    "The universe throbs with Thy pauseless praise,",
    "Chorus eternal, the Lord is King.",
    "Thy glory is cried from the dawn of days,",
    "Worshippers calling the Lord was King.",
    "And ever the Saints who shall witness Thy ways",
    "Shall cry that the Lord shall be King for ever.",
    "The Lord is King, the Lord was King, the Lord shall be King for ever and ever."
