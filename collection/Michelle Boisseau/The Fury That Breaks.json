    "The fury that breaks a grown-up into kids,",
    "a kid into scattered birds",
    "and a bird into limp eggs,",
    "the fury of the poor",
    "takes one part oil to two parts vinegar.",
    "The fury that breaks a tree into leaves,",
    "a leaf into deranged flowers",
    "and a flower into wilting telescopes,",
    "the fury of the poor",
    "gushes two rivers against a hundred seas.",
    "The fury that breaks the true into doubts,",
    "doubt into three matching arches",
    "and the arch into instant tombs,",
    "the fury of the poor",
    "draws a sharpening stone against two knives.",
    "The fury that breaks the soul into bodies,",
    "the body into warped organs,",
    "and the organ into eight doctrines,",
    "the fury of the poor",
    "burns with one fire in two thousand craters."
