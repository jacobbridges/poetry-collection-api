    "In sodden trenches I have heard men speak,",
    "Though numb and wretched, wise and witty things;",
    "And loved them for the stubbornness that clings",
    "Longest to laughter when Death's pulleys creak;",
    "And seeing cool nurses move on tireless feet",
    "To do abominable things with grace,",
    "Deemed them sweet sisters in that haunted place",
    "Where, with child's voices, strong men howl or bleat.",
    "Yet now those men lay stubborn courage by,",
    "Riding dull-eyed and silent in the train",
    "To old men's stools; or sell gay-coloured socks",
    "And listen fearfully for Death; so I",
    "Love the low-laughing girls, who now again",
    "Go daintily, in thin and flowery frocks."
