    "Whatever city or country road",
    "you two are on",
    "there are nettles,",
    "and the dark invisible",
    "elements cling to your skin",
    "though you do not cry",
    "and you do not scratch",
    "your arms at forty-five degree angles",
    "as the landing point of a swan",
    "in the Ohio, the Detroit River;",
    "at the Paradise Theatre",
    "you named the cellist",
    "with the fanatical fingers",
    "of the plumber, the exorcist,",
    "and though the gimmicky at wrist",
    "and kneecaps could lift the seance",
    "table, your voice was real",
    "in the gait and laughter of Uncle",
    "Henry, who could dance on either",
    "leg, wooden or real, to the sound",
    "of the troop train, megaphone,",
    "catching the fine pitch of a singer",
    "on the athletic fields of Virginia.",
    "At the Radisson Hotel,",
    "we once took a fine angel",
    "of the law to the convention center,",
    "and put her down as an egret",
    "in the subzero platform of a friend\u2014",
    "this is Minneapolis, the movies",
    "are all of strangers, holding themselves",
    "in the delicacy of treading water,",
    "while they wait for the trumpet",
    "of the 20th Century Limited",
    "over the bluff or cranny.",
    "You two men like to confront.",
    "the craters of history and spillage,",
    "our natural infections of you",
    "innoculating blankets and fur,",
    "ethos of cadaver and sunflower.",
    "I hold the dogwood blossom,",
    "eat the pear, and watch the nettle",
    "swim up in the pools",
    "of the completed song",
    "of Leadbelly and Little Crow",
    "crooning the buffalo and horse",
    "to the changes and the bridge",
    "of a twelve-string guitar,",
    "the melody of \u201cIrene\u201d;",
    "this is really goodbye\u2014",
    "I can see the precious stones",
    "of embolism and consumption",
    "on the platinum wires of the mouth:",
    "in the flowing rivers, in the public baths",
    "of Ohio and Michigan."
