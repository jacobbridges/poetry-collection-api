    "The wrinkles on the brown face",
    "of the carrying case",
    "conform to the buttocks,",
    "on which the streaks of water",
    "from a five-gallon can",
    "dribble on the tailfront",
    "of the borrowed shirt",
    "he would wear if he could",
    "drain the pus from his swaddling",
    "bandages, striations of skin",
    "tunneling into the photograph.",
    "This is no simple mug shot",
    "of a runaway boy in a training",
    "film, Soweto's pummeled wire,",
    "though the turrets of light",
    "glisten in smoke, the soft",
    "coal hooding his platform",
    "entrance, dull and quiet.",
    "His father's miner's shoes",
    "stand in puddles of polish,",
    "the black soot baked",
    "into images of brittle torso,",
    "an inferno of bullets laid",
    "out in a letter bomb,",
    "the frontispiece of one sergeant-",
    "major blackening his mustache.",
    "On the drive to Evaton",
    "a blank pass away from Sharpeville",
    "where the freehold morgans",
    "were bought by a black bishop",
    "from Ontario, Canada, on a trek",
    "northward from the Cape in 1908,",
    "I speak to myself as the woman",
    "riding in the backseat talks",
    "of this day, her husband's",
    "death, twenty-three years ago,",
    "run over by an Afrikaner in the wrong",
    "passing lane; the passbook on the shoulder",
    "of the road leading to Evaton",
    "is not the one I have in my hand,",
    "and the photograph is not of my great-",
    "grandfather, who set sail for Philadelphia",
    "in the war year of 1916.",
    "He did not want a reception, his letters",
    "embarking on a platform at Queenstown",
    "where his eloquence struck two Zulu warriors",
    "pledged to die in the homelands",
    "because they could not spin their own gold.",
    "These threaded heads weigh down the ears",
    "in design of the warrior, Shaka,",
    "indifferent to the ruthless offerings",
    "over the dead bodies of his wives,",
    "childless in the campaigns with the British,",
    "who sit on the ships of the Indian Ocean",
    "each kraal shuddering near the borders;",
    "her lips turn in profile",
    "to the dust rising over a road",
    "where his house once stood;",
    "one could think of the women",
    "carrying firewood as an etching",
    "in remembrance to the silence,",
    "commencing at Sharpeville,",
    "but this is Evaton, where he would come",
    "from across the galleyship of spears",
    "turning in his robes to a bookmark;",
    "it is a good book, the picture of words",
    "in the gloss of a photograph,",
    "the burned image of the man who wears",
    "this image on the tongue of a child,",
    "who might hold my hand",
    "as we walk in late afternoon",
    "into the predestined sun.",
    "The press of wrinkles on the blanketed",
    "voice of the man who took the train",
    "from Johannesburg",
    "is flattened in Cape Town,",
    "and the history of this book",
    "is on a trestle where Gandhi",
    "worshipped in Natal,",
    "and the Zulu lullaby",
    "I cannot sing in Bantu",
    "is this song in the body",
    "of a passbook",
    "and the book passes",
    "into a shirt",
    "and the back that wears it."
