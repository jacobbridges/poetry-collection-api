    "When I stood behind his desk chair",
    "and when he sat, on rare occasions,",
    "on the porch, \u201csage of Anacostia,\u201d",
    "they called him, I smelled his mane",
    "glorious, and as a hand saddle",
    "the aroma of hair took me to neckline",
    "and below. In Egypt, long after",
    "Napoleon had shot off the face",
    "of the Sphinx, I thought of this",
    "man, and the cusp of his palms",
    "on my shoulder blades;",
    "as always he was carrying the mail",
    "of gender, his touch immaculate",
    "in the true blend of the cortex,",
    "and of the complex, risen on a pulpit,",
    "and after the hot air, wintry parlance,",
    "the syllables of my name in his ear,",
    "when he touched me, as he had touched",
    "me then.",
    "I had my suspicions of English",
    "ladies, actresses, ghosts of the Thames,",
    "concubines, as we had been into this next",
    "century. And they had their wiles with him.",
    "I do not feel forbidden; the cameo ring",
    "he gave me, recession of his maleness",
    "all I need, and highlights of my dark",
    "profile, any children we might have",
    "had buried in architecture,",
    "and the hate of his daughter Rosetta,",
    "who I have spoken to over the grate.",
    "The sun rises and sets in our neighborhood:",
    "I WILL BURN THESE. But when I place my fingers",
    "in that mane it is to the saddle he will come."
