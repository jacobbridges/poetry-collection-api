    "When news came that your mother\u2019d",
    "smashed her hip, both feet caught",
    "in rungs of the banquet table,",
    "our wedding rebroken on the memory",
    "of the long lake of silence",
    "when the stones of her body",
    "broke as an Irish fence of stones,",
    "I saw your wet dugs drag",
    "with the weight of our daughter",
    "in the quick of her sleep",
    "to another feeding;",
    "then the shoulders dropped",
    "their broken antenna branches",
    "of fear at the knife",
    "running the scars",
    "which had been born into the colon",
    "for the misspent enema,",
    "the clubbed liver unclean",
    "with the stones of the gall bladder,",
    "and the broken arch of hip",
    "lugging you to the lake,",
    "the dough inner tube of lading",
    "swollen with innerpatching.",
    "I pick you up from the floor",
    "of your ringing fears, the floor",
    "where the photographs you have worked",
    "into the cool sky of the gray you love,",
    "and you are back at the compost pile",
    "where the vegetables burn,",
    "or swim in the storm of your childhood,",
    "when your father egged you on with his",
    "open machinery, the exhaust choking your sisters,",
    "and your sisters choked still.",
    "Now this voice stops you in accusation,",
    "and the years pile up on themselves",
    "in the eggs of your stretched sons,",
    "one born on his birthday, both dead.",
    "I pull you off into the sanctuary",
    "of conciliation, of quiet tactics,",
    "the uttered question, the referral,",
    "which will quiet the condition you have seen",
    "in your mother\u2019s shadow, the crutches",
    "inching in the uncut grass,",
    "and the worn body you will carry",
    "as your own birthmark of his scream."
