    "Birdsongs that sound like the steady determined tapping",
    "of a shoemaker's hammer,",
    "or of a sculptor making tiny ball-peen dents in a silver plate,",
    "wake me this morning.",
    "The calico cat",
    "stretches her long body out across the top of my computer monitor,",
    "yawning, its little primitive head a cave of possibility.",
    "And I'm ready again",
    "to try and see accidents, the over and over patterns",
    "of double-slit experiments a billionfold",
    "repeated before me. If I had great patience,",
    "I could try to count the poplar, birch and oak",
    "leaves in their shifting welter outside my bedroom window",
    "or the almost infinitesimal trails of thought that flash and flash",
    "everywhere, as if decaying particles inside a bubble chamber,",
    "windshield raindrops, lake ripples. However,",
    "instead I go to fry some bacon, crack two eggs",
    "into the cast-iron skillet that's even older than this house,",
    "and on the calendar (each month another oriental fan",
    "where the climbing solitary is dwarfed . . . or on dark blue oceans",
    "minuscular fishing boats bob beneath gigantic waves)",
    "X out the days, including those I've forgotten."
