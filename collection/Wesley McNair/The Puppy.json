    "From down the road, starting up",
    "and stopping once more, the sound",
    "of a puppy on a chain who has not yet",
    "discovered he will spend his life there.",
    "Foolish dog, to forget where he is",
    "and wander until he feels the collar",
    "close fast around his throat, then cry",
    "all over again about the little space",
    "in which he finds himself. Soon,",
    "when there is no grass left in it",
    "and he understands it is all he has,",
    "he will snarl and bark whenever",
    "he senses a threat to it.",
    "Who would believe this small",
    "sorrow could lead to such fury",
    "no one would ever come near him?"
