    "How the thickest of them erupt just",
    "above the ear, cresting in waves so stiff",
    "no wind can move them. Let us praise them",
    "in all of their varieties, some skinny",
    "as the bands of headphones, some rising",
    "from a part that extends halfway around",
    "the head, others four or five strings",
    "stretched so taut the scalp resembles",
    "a musical instrument. Let us praise the sprays",
    "that hold them, and the combs that coax",
    "such abundance to the front of the head",
    "in the mirror, the combers entirely forget",
    "the back. And let us celebrate the combers,",
    "who address the old sorrow of time\u2019s passing",
    "day after day, bringing out of the barrenness",
    "of mid-life this ridiculous and wonderful",
    "harvest, no wishful flag of hope, but, thick,",
    "or thin, the flag itself, unfurled for us all",
    "in subways, offices, and malls across America."
