    "I saw him once before,",
    "As he passed by the door,",
    "And again",
    "The pavement stones resound,",
    "As he totters o\u2019er the ground",
    "With his cane.",
    "They say that in his prime,",
    "Ere the pruning-knife of Time",
    "Cut him down,",
    "Not a better man was found",
    "By the Crier on his round",
    "Through the town.",
    "But now he walks the streets,",
    "And looks at all he meets",
    "Sad and wan,",
    "And he shakes his feeble head,",
    "That it seems as if he said,",
    "\u201cThey are gone.\u201d",
    "The mossy marbles rest",
    "On the lips that he has prest",
    "In their bloom,",
    "And the names he loved to hear",
    "Have been carved for many a year",
    "On the tomb.",
    "My grandmamma has said\u2014",
    "Poor old lady, she is dead",
    "Long ago\u2014",
    "That he had a Roman nose,",
    "And his cheek was like a rose",
    "In the snow;",
    "But now his nose is thin,",
    "And it rests upon his chin",
    "Like a staff,",
    "And a crook is in his back,",
    "And a melancholy crack",
    "In his laugh.",
    "I know it is a sin",
    "For me to sit and grin",
    "At him here;",
    "But the old three-cornered hat,",
    "And the breeches, and all that,",
    "Are so queer!",
    "And if I should live to be",
    "The last leaf upon the tree",
    "In the spring,",
    "Let them smile, as I do now,",
    "At the old forsaken bough",
    "Where I cling."
