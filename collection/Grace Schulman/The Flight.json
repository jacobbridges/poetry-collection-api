    "That day I hired a private detective to follow me,",
    "and could not read his notes. In a tangled grove,",
    "I hid behind white pines, compressed my body,",
    "then watched him write, left-handed and myopic,",
    "under an Irish cap, when I asked for help",
    "from strangers who spoke Slavic languages.",
    "Wary, moving ahead, I found a depot,",
    "watched an immense train churn, haloed in steam,",
    "and boarded, second class. I had no ticket,",
    "and my expired passport represented",
    "a drooping head with unfamiliar eyes.",
    "Unshaken, rows behind, the stranger waited,",
    "wielding camera and pen. Across the border",
    "I disembarked, but knew he would capture me,",
    "with soundless footsteps, even on black gravel.",
    "I tried to recall my crime. I know I am guilty,",
    "but never why. Lawless, I have ignored",
    "those signs:",
    ";",
    "and",
    ",",
    "circles that tell me",
    ". I gather",
    "it is the whispers that explode, the looks",
    "that make dogs whimper. When I bow in prayer",
    "I think of love; I know I\u2019ve killed my friends,",
    "pelting them with a touch\u2014and yet I\u2019ve heard",
    "they are alive. Besides, that\u2019s not the real",
    "offense. I would cross any path, or trek",
    "through swamps to find my crime. But even he,",
    "that bald, insistent man who follows me,",
    "unsleeping, cannot tell me what I\u2019ve done."
