    "I",
    "Leaguered in fire",
    "The wild black promontories of the coast extend",
    "Their savage silhouettes;",
    "The sun in universal carnage sets,",
    "And, halting higher,",
    "The motionless storm-clouds mass their sullen threats,",
    "Like an advancing mob in sword-points penned,",
    "That, balked, yet stands at bay.",
    "Mid-zenith hangs the fascinated day",
    "In wind-lustrated hollows crystalline,",
    "A wan Valkyrie whose wide pinions shine",
    "Across the ensanguined ruins of the fray,",
    "And in her hand swings high o\u2019erhead,",
    "Above the waster of war,",
    "The silver torch-light of the evening star",
    "Wherewith to search the faces of the dead.",
    "II",
    "Lagooned in gold,",
    "Seem not those jetty promontories rather",
    "The outposts of some ancient land forlorn,",
    "Uncomforted of morn,",
    "Where old oblivions gather,",
    "The melancholy unconsoling fold",
    "Of all things that go utterly to death",
    "And mix no more, no more",
    "With life\u2019s perpetually awakening breath?",
    "Shall Time not ferry me to such a shore,",
    "Over such sailless seas,",
    "To walk with hope\u2019s slain importunities",
    "In miserable marriage? Nay, shall not",
    "All things be there forgot,",
    "Save the sea\u2019s golden barrier and the black",
    "Close-crouching promontories?",
    "Dead to all shames, forgotten of all glories,",
    "Shall I not wander there, a shadow\u2019s shade,",
    "A spectre self-destroyed,",
    "So purged of all remembrance and sucked back",
    "Into the primal void,",
    "That should we on the shore phantasmal meet",
    "I should not know the coming of your feet?"
