    "As apparent as the rest, the asphalt cracks",
    "are crowded with yellow weeds, the rust goes",
    "beyond its bleeding color, and the lot's rails,",
    "battered by cars, cast larger bars by noon.",
    "On one side of the market someone painted",
    "a row of flower pots, hanging geraniums",
    "for the locals who must now go across town.",
    "As apparent as the rest, El Tigre walks upright,",
    "wears a tiny sombrero and sarape, and pushes",
    "a grocery cart full of food. His painted stripes",
    "are starting to flake like the bounty he wheels",
    "for the families drifting into the parking lot",
    "off 3rd Street and next to the train station",
    "still waiting to the retrofitted for the big one."
