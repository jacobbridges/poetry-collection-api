    "If I had enough cages to keep all the birds",
    "I\u2019ve collected over the years then I would have",
    "to open a shop because there\u2019s only so much room",
    "in a two-bedroom walk-up for 48 birds,",
    "not to mention the dancing bears and the frogs,",
    "or the different varieties of fish, the one",
    "species of flea, and I almost forgot the proud",
    "dogs and the lone mule, the profane one",
    "who entered my life to curse at scribes and pharisees;",
    "and maybe he\u2019d let the mouse I found",
    "forever dying at the end of a poem",
    "ride on his back like a whiskered Christ",
    "and if not, maybe my yeti could do it",
    "when he\u2019s not downtown working",
    "security at the store or teaching the parrots",
    "how to say",
    "in grunt",
    "and how to comb out the tangles and mud",
    "from his hair whose sweat reminds me",
    "of that bearded collector of beasts",
    "with the ark who would have no doubt",
    "understood how I feel, that prophet",
    "of change under whose spell I want to confess",
    "that I\u2019m a Christian of the Old Testament,",
    "that my grandfather hung all his goats",
    "upside down, their throats over a bucket,",
    "and slapped their chests like that other Nature Boy",
    "who strutted around the ring",
    "like a peacock with his feathered hair",
    "that stayed immaculate",
    "even on the nights he lost to our hero",
    "Wahoo McDaniel who never played the heel,",
    "he who hailed from the lost tribes",
    "of Oklahoma, who made us want to be chiefs",
    "so much we wore pigeon feathers",
    "and circled each other inside a green square",
    "of water hose until someone finally rang the bell",
    "that was never there and we sprung",
    "toward each other like animals in love or at war."
