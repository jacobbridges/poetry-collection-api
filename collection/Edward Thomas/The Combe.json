    "The Combe was ever dark, ancient and dark.",
    "Its mouth is stopped with bramble, thorn, and briar;",
    "And no one scrambles over the sliding chalk",
    "By beech and yew and perishing juniper",
    "Down the half precipices of its sides, with roots",
    "And rabbit holes for steps. The sun of Winter,",
    "The moon of Summer, and all the singing birds",
    "Except the missel-thrush that loves juniper,",
    "Are quite shut out. But far more ancient and dark",
    "The Combe looks since they killed the badger there,",
    "Dug him out and gave him to the hounds,",
    "That most ancient Briton of English beasts."
