    "Rain, midnight rain, nothing but the wild rain",
    "On this bleak hut, and solitude, and me",
    "Remembering again that I shall die",
    "And neither hear the rain nor give it thanks",
    "For washing me cleaner than I have been",
    "Since I was born into solitude.",
    "Blessed are the dead that the rain rains upon:",
    "But here I pray that none whom once I loved",
    "Is dying tonight or lying still awake",
    "Solitary, listening to the rain,",
    "Either in pain or thus in sympathy",
    "Helpless among the living and the dead,",
    "Like a cold water among broken reeds,",
    "Myriads of broken reeds all still and stiff,",
    "Like me who have no love which this wild rain",
    "Has not dissolved except the love of death,",
    "If love it be towards what is perfect and",
    "Cannot, the tempest tells me, disappoint."
