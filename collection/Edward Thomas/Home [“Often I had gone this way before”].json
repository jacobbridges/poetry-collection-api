    "Often I had gone this way before:",
    "But now it seemed I never could be",
    "And never had been anywhere else;",
    "'Twas home; one nationality",
    "We had, I and the birds that sang,",
    "One memory.",
    "They welcomed me. I had come back",
    "That eve somehow from somewhere far:",
    "The April mist, the chill, the calm,",
    "Meant the same thing familiar",
    "And pleasant to us, and strange too,",
    "Yet with no bar.",
    "The thrush on the oaktop in the lane",
    "Sang his last song, or last but one;",
    "And as he ended, on the elm",
    "Another had but just begun",
    "His last; they knew no more than I",
    "The day was done.",
    "Then past his dark white cottage front",
    "A labourer went along, his tread",
    "Slow, half with weariness, half with ease;",
    "And, through the silence, from his shed",
    "The sound of sawing rounded all",
    "That silence said."
