    "Seated once by a brook, watching a child",
    "Chiefly that paddled, I was thus beguiled.",
    "Mellow the blackbird sang and sharp the thrush",
    "Not far off in the oak and hazel brush,",
    "Unseen. There was a scent like honeycomb",
    "From mugwort dull. And down upon the dome",
    "Of the stone the cart-horse kicks against so oft",
    "A butterfly alighted. From aloft",
    "He took the heat of the sun, and from below.",
    "On the hot stone he perched contented so,",
    "As if never a cart would pass again",
    "That way; as if I were the last of men",
    "And he the first of insects to have earth",
    "And sun together and to know their worth.",
    "I was divided between him and the gleam,",
    "The motion, and the voices, of the stream,",
    "The waters running frizzled over gravel,",
    "That never vanish and for ever travel.",
    "A grey flycatcher silent on a fence",
    "And I sat as if we had been there since",
    "The horseman and the horse lying beneath",
    "The fir-tree-covered barrow on the heath,",
    "The horseman and the horse with silver shoes,",
    "Galloped the downs last. All that I could lose",
    "I lost. And then the child\u2019s voice raised the dead.",
    "\u201cNo one\u2019s been here before\u201d was what she said",
    "And what I felt, yet never should have found",
    "A word for, while I gathered sight and sound."
