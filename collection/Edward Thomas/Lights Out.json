    "I have come to the borders of sleep,",
    "The unfathomable deep",
    "Forest where all must lose",
    "Their way, however straight,",
    "Or winding, soon or late;",
    "They cannot choose.",
    "Many a road and track",
    "That, since the dawn\u2019s first crack,",
    "Up to the forest brink,",
    "Deceived the travellers,",
    "Suddenly now blurs,",
    "And in they sink.",
    "Here love ends,",
    "Despair, ambition ends;",
    "All pleasure and all trouble,",
    "Although most sweet or bitter,",
    "Here ends in sleep that is sweeter",
    "Than tasks most noble.",
    "There is not any book",
    "Or face of dearest look",
    "That I would not turn from now",
    "To go into the unknown",
    "I must enter, and leave, alone,",
    "I know not how.",
    "The tall forest towers;",
    "Its cloudy foliage lowers",
    "Ahead, shelf above shelf;",
    "Its silence I hear and obey",
    "That I may lose my way",
    "And myself."
