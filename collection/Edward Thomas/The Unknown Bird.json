    "Three lovely notes he whistled, too soft to be heard",
    "If others sang; but others never sang",
    "In the great beech-wood all that May and June.",
    "No one saw him: I alone could hear him",
    "Though many listened. Was it but four years",
    "Ago? or five? He never came again.",
    "Oftenest when I heard him I was alone,",
    "Nor could I ever make another hear.",
    "La-la-la! he called, seeming far-off\u2014",
    "As if a cock crowed past the edge of the world,",
    "As if the bird or I were in a dream.",
    "Yet that he travelled through the trees and sometimes",
    "Neared me, was plain, though somehow distant still",
    "He sounded. All the proof is\u2014I told men",
    "What I had heard.",
    "I never knew a voice,",
    "Man, beast, or bird, better than this. I told",
    "The naturalists; but neither had they heard",
    "Anything like the notes that did so haunt me,",
    "I had them clear by heart and have them still.",
    "Four years, or five, have made no difference. Then",
    "As now that La-la-la! was bodiless sweet:",
    "Sad more than joyful it was, if I must say",
    "That it was one or other, but if sad",
    "'Twas sad only with joy too, too far off",
    "For me to taste it. But I cannot tell",
    "If truly never anything but fair",
    "The days were when he sang, as now they seem.",
    "This surely I know, that I who listened then,",
    "Happy sometimes, sometimes suffering",
    "A heavy body and a heavy heart,",
    "Now straightway, if I think of it, become",
    "Light as that bird wandering beyond my shore."
