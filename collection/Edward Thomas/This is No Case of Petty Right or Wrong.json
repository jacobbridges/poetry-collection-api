    "But I have not to choose between the two,",
    "Or between justice and injustice. Dinned",
    "With war and argument I read no more",
    "Than in the storm smoking along the wind",
    "Athwart the wood. Two witches' cauldrons roar.",
    "From one the weather shall rise clear and gay;",
    "Out of the other an England beautiful",
    "And like her mother that died yesterday."
