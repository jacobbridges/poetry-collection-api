    "The sorrow of true love is a great sorrow",
    "And true love parting blackens a bright morrow:",
    "Yet almost they equal joys, since their despair",
    "Is but hope blinded by its tears, and clear",
    "Above the storm the heavens wait to be seen.",
    "But greater sorrow from less love has been",
    "That can mistake lack of despair for hope",
    "And knows not tempest and the perfect scope",
    "Of summer, but a frozen drizzle perpetual",
    "Of drops that from remorse and pity fall",
    "And cannot ever shine in the sun or thaw,",
    "Removed eternally from the sun\u2019s law.",
