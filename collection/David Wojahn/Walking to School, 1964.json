    "Blurring the window, the snowflakes' numb white lanterns.",
    "She's brewed her coffee, in the bathroom sprays cologne",
    "And sets her lipstick upright on the sink.",
    "The door ajar, I glimpse the yellow slip,",
    "The rose-colored birthmark on her shoulder.",
    "Then she's dressed\u2014the pillbox hat and ersatz fur,",
    "And I'm dressed too, mummified in stocking cap",
    "And scarves, and I walk her to the bus stop",
    "Where she'll leave me for my own walk to school,",
    "Where she'll board the bus that zigzags to St. Paul",
    "As I watch her at the window, the paperback",
    "Romance already open on her lap,",
    "The bus laboring off into snow, her good-bye kiss",
    "Still startling my cheek with lipstick trace."
