    "An idle lingerer on the wayside's road,",
    "He gathers up his work and yawns away;",
    "A little longer, ere the tiresome load",
    "Shall be reduced to ashes or to clay.",
    "No matter if the world has marched along,",
    "And scorned his slowness as it quickly passed;",
    "No matter, if amid the busy throng,",
    "He greets some face, infantile at the last.",
    "His mission? Well, there is but one,",
    "And if it is a mission he knows it, nay,",
    "To be a happy idler, to lounge and sun,",
    "And dreaming, pass his long-drawn days away.",
    "So dreams he on, his happy life to pass",
    "Content, without ambitions painful sighs,",
    "Until the sands run down into the glass;",
    "He smiles\u2014content\u2014unmoved and dies.",
    "And yet, with all the pity that you feel",
    "For this poor mothling of that flame, the world;",
    "Are you the better for your desperate deal,",
    "When you, like him, into infinitude are hurled?"
