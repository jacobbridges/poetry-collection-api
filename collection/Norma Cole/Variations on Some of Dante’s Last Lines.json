    "And move and hold back",
    "entering by the highroad through the words",
    "and fall like a person hit by sleep",
    "arriving at the place without light",
    "And fall like a dead body falls",
    "and find there the great enemy",
    "and come to a tower all of stones",
    "such that through it the earth opens",
    "We pass between the martyrs and the high walls",
    "even up there water is pouring out",
    "then turning and fording again",
    "sling the noose from the roof of the house",
    "And each and every vapor spent",
    "over winning and not losing",
    "in which it stands caught out",
    "fleet then catapults like a stone",
    "Filling our view",
    "whereupon another valley is revealed"
