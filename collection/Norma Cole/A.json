    "one box falls out of another box, ashy covenant of separation",
    "two birds, one clamp, no reaction just hanging there as the arrow moved",
    "notes put the map back into the water",
    "they don\u2019t notice what they\u2019re learning",
    "name all the days, parts of them painted to look out of control then crashed into a tree",
    "letters in the boxes in the light old lady opportunity",
    "the mirror ceases to be right here, pressure on the hand sends a biscuit to the mouth",
    "a circuit connected by eyes stopping watching",
    "quantity of information in the type, nation in the line or lines",
    "legs broken and maladroit preview a long corridor filing against",
    "walls engaging hands going without end in the corridor",
    "back to front to quay, cracking of wood, a miner\u2019s ladder five meters high",
    "notices filled with objects",
    "later, however, a gelatin lit up, Chinese cryptesthesia, American music",
    "mural fold or fist, magnetic moment measures behavior, thinking penetrates slowly",
    "start over a sensible solution, a compact rower\u2019s body zippered",
    "into an orange flight suit, all the confidence of the Chinese navy exposing a big area extinct of life forms"
