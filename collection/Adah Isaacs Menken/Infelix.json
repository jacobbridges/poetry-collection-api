    "Where is the promise of my years;",
    "Once written on my brow?",
    "Ere errors, agonies and fears",
    "Brought with them all that speaks in tears,",
    "Ere I had sunk beneath my peers;",
    "Where sleeps that promise now?",
    "Naught lingers to redeem those hours,",
    "Still, still to memory sweet!",
    "The flowers that bloomed in sunny bowers",
    "Are withered all; and Evil towers",
    "Supreme above her sister powers",
    "Of Sorrow and Deceit.",
    "I look along the columned years,",
    "And see Life\u2019s riven fane,",
    "Just where it fell, amid the jeers",
    "Of scornful lips, whose mocking sneers,",
    "For ever hiss within mine ears",
    "To break the sleep of pain.",
    "I can but own my life is vain",
    "A desert void of peace;",
    "I missed the goal I sought to gain,",
    "I missed the measure of the strain",
    "That lulls Fame\u2019s fever in the brain,",
    "And bids Earth\u2019s tumult cease.",
    "Myself! alas for theme so poor",
    "A theme but rich in Fear;",
    "I stand a wreck on Error\u2019s shore,",
    "A spectre not within the door,",
    "A houseless shadow evermore,",
    "An exile lingering here."
