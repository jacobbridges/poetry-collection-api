    "My mother is obsessed with reading about Jesus these days.",
    "I see books piled by her bed, most of them borrowed from my library: novels, handbooks, sectarian polemics, writers coming to blows. Sometimes when I\u2019m passing by her room she calls on me to step between them and resolve their disputes. (A little while ago I came to the aid of a historian called Kamal Salibi, whose forehead had been split open by a Catholic stone.)",
    "What a diligent reader she is when she\u2019s searching for Jesus, this woman I never failed to disappoint: I was not martyred in the first intifada, nor in the second, nor in the third. And just between you and me, I won\u2019t be martyred in any future intifada either, nor will I be killed by some booby-trapped stork.",
    "As she reads, her orthodox imagination crucifies me with every page.... while I do nothing but supply it with more books and nails."
