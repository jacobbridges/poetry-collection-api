    "I do not understand the poets who tell me",
    "that I should not personify. Every morning",
    "the willow auditions for a new role",
    "outside my bedroom window\u2014today she is",
    "Clytemnestra; yesterday a Southern Belle,",
    "lost in her own melodrama, sinking on her skirts.",
    "Nor do I like the mathematicians who tell me",
    "I cannot say, \"The zinnias are counting on their",
    "fingers,\" or \"The dog is practicing her geometry,\"",
    "even though every day I watch her using",
    "the yard's big maple as the apex of a triangle",
    "from which she bisects the circumference",
    "of the lawn until she finds the place where",
    "the rabbit has escaped, or the squirrel upped",
    "the ante by climbing into a new Euclidian plane.",
    "She stumbles across the lawn, eyes pulling",
    "her feet along, gaze fixed on a rodent working",
    "the maze of the oak as if it were his own invention,",
    "her feet tangling in the roots of trees, and tripping,",
    "yes, even over themselves, until I go out to assist,",
    "by pointing at the squirrel, and repeating, \"There!",
    "There!\" But instead of following my outstretched",
    "arm to the crown of the tree, where the animal is",
    "now lounging under a canopy of leaves,",
    "catching its breath, charting its next escape,",
    "she looks to my mouth, eager to read my lips,",
    "confident that I\u2014who can bring her home",
    "from across the field with a word, who",
    "can speak for the willow and the zinnia\u2014",
    "can surely charm a squirrel down from a tree."
