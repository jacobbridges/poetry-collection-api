    "These grapes of stone were being proffered, friend.",
    "\u2014 John Berryman",
    "grapes, rough-touched and round, stone-",
    "carved, to be squeezed into the fundaments",
    "of rock wine. She imagines it would be cold,",
    "not sought for its smoothness,",
    "and likely full of grit",
    "if not refined with care.",
    "The satyr laughs carelessly",
    "for one caught in stone.",
    "The cracked edges of his mouth spill grit",
    "as he leers after the loss of his fundaments",
    "which fall along the smooth,",
    "cold",
    "torso plane, exhibiting immaculate coolness",
    "at this literal loss of face. Carefully,",
    "she strokes his head, as if smoothing",
    "the fetlocks handcrafted from stone.",
    "Her affection is unforced, a fundamental",
    "attraction to those beautiful, gritty",
    "things made lovely by decay, their gritted",
    "teeth so much more interesting than the art gallery\u2019s cold",
    "geometrics, which appear fundamental",
    "but fail to consider the careless",
    "chaos spinning at the stone",
    "center of all smooth",
    "creations. And those grapes! Their unsmooth",
    "surface mirrors the messy passion flushing the grit-",
    "dusted cheek, the hideous mouth of crumbling stone.",
    "What heat from the Dionysian\u2019s cold,",
    "brittle fruit! The obliteration of all care",
    "if she could only perform the fundamental",
    "act of eating. She thinks about wilderness, fun, mental",
    "liberation, dancing her soles smooth,",
    "pleasure as pervasive as care",
    "is now, her feet a frenzied blur on the gritty",
    "forest floor, shaking and pummeling out the cold",
    "as she prances over starlit stones.",
    "She does not care who sees her, as she grips the stone",
    "grapes, feels the smooth, crumbling cold",
    "enter her hand, fingers embracing a thing more fundamental than earth, bone, grit."
