    "The last two sherpas were the strongest,",
    "faithful companions, their faces wind-peeled,",
    "streaked with soot and glacier-light on the snowfield",
    "below the summit where we stopped to rest.",
    "The first was my body, snug in its cap of lynx-",
    "fur, smelling of yak butter and fine mineral dirt,",
    "agile, impetuous, broad-shouldered,",
    "alive to the frozen bite of oxygen in the larynx.",
    "The second was my intellect, dour and thirsty,",
    "furrowing its fox-like brow, my calculating brain",
    "searching for some cairn or chasm to explain",
    "my decision to send them back without me.",
    "Looking down from the next, ax-cleft serac",
    "I saw them turn and dwindle and felt unafraid.",
    "Blind as a diamond, sun-pure and rarefied,",
    "whatever I was then, there was no turning back."
