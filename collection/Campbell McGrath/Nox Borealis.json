    "If Socrates drank his portion of hemlock willingly,",
    "if the Appalachians have endured unending ages of erosion,",
    "if the wind can learn to read our minds",
    "and moonlight moonlight as a master pickpocket,",
    "surely we can contend with contentment as our commission.",
    "Deer in a stubble field, small birds dreaming",
    "unimaginable dreams in hollow trees,",
    "even the icicles, darling, even the icicles shame us",
    "with their stoicism, their radiant resolve.",
    "Listen to me now: think of something you love",
    "but not too dearly, so the night will steal from us",
    "only what we can afford to lose."
