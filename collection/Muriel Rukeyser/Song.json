    "Make and be eaten, the poet says,",
    "Lie in the arms of nightlong fire,",
    "To celebrate the waking, wake.",
    "Burn in the daylong light; and praise",
    "Even the mother unappeased,",
    "Even the fathers of desire.",
    "Blind go the days, but joy will see",
    "Agreements of music; they will wind",
    "The shaking of your dance; no more",
    "Will the ambiguous arm-waves spell",
    "Confusion of the blessing given.",
    "Only and finally declare",
    "Among the purest shapes of grace",
    "The waking of the face of fire,",
    "The body of waking and the skill",
    "To make your body such a shape",
    "That all the eyes of hope shall stare.",
    "That all the cries of fear shall know,",
    "Staring in their bird-pierced song;",
    "Lines of such penetration make",
    "That shall bind our loves at last.",
    "Then from the mountains of the lost,",
    "All the fantasies shall wake,",
    "Strong and real and speaking turn",
    "Wherever flickers your unreal.",
    "And my strong ghosts shall fade and pass",
    "My love start fiery as grass",
    "Wherever burn my fantasies,",
    "Wherever burn my fantasies."
