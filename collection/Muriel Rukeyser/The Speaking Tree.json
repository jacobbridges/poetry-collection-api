    "Great Alexander sailing was from his true course turned",
    "By a young wind from a cloud in Asia moving",
    "Like a most recognizable most silvery woman;",
    "Tall Alexander to the island came.",
    "The small breeze blew behind his turning head.",
    "He walked the foam of ripples into this scene.",
    "The trunk of the speaking tree looks like a tree-trunk",
    "Until you look again. Then people and animals",
    "Are ripening on the branches; the broad leaves",
    "Are leaves; pale horses, sharp fine foxes",
    "Blossom; the red rabbit falls",
    "Ready and running. The trunk coils, turns,",
    "Snakes, fishes. Now the ripe people fall and run,",
    "Three of them in their shore-dance, flames that stand",
    "Where reeds are creatures and the foam is flame.",
    "Stiff Alexander stands. He cannot turn.",
    "But he is free to turn : this is the speaking tree,",
    "It calls your name. It tells us what we mean.",
