    "For that you never acknowledged me, I acknowledge",

    "the anonymous unacknowledged men and women.",
    "The shine as it glitters in our child\u2019s wild eyes,",

    "the years of the shadow on the delicate skin",
    "of my hand, moving in time.",
    "Disinherited, annulled, finally disacknowledged",
    "and all of my own asking. I keep that wild dimension",

    "upon my mouth as I say this word of acknowledge",
    "to you forever.",

    "II.",
    "While this my day and my people are a country not yet born",

    "but far under consciousness, knowing",
    "that under under flows a river wanting",
    "the other : to go open-handed in Asia,",
    "to cleanse the tributaries and the air, to make for making,",
    "to stop selling death and its trash, pour plastic down men\u2019s throats,",
    "to let this child find, to let men and women find,",
    "knowing the seeds in us all. They do say Find.",
    "I cannot acknowledge it entire. But I will.",
    "A beginning, this moment, perhaps, and you.",
    "III.",
    "Death flowing down past me, past me, death",
    "marvelous, filthy, gold,",
    "in my spine in my sex upon my broken mouth",
    "and the whole beautiful mouth of the child;",
    "shedding power over me",
    "death",
    "if I acknowledge him.",
    "Leading me",
    "in my own body",
    "at last in the dance."
