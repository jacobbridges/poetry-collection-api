    "In the rearview, fog extinguishes the hills of new",
    "money\u2014mansions on acres away from road or sight.",
    "Their architected privacy, windows to look out at",
    "a land that won't look back. The fog's secure drapery.",
    "It's space to dance through they buy and what one",
    "might call \"dappled light\" moving across their acres, light",
    "through their oaks moving over their mares, brushed to a sheen.",
    "Palms of sugar cubes. Soft snorting, I bet. Here, Muybridge",
    "proved their horses fly a moment. In their homes, they can't",
    "hear each other call from foyer to pool house. I am",
    "jealous of this loneliness most of all\u2014loneliness",
    "delimited by colonnade and cold pressed juices.",
    ".... I imagine hills and hills dappled like this."
