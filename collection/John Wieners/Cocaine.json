    "For I have seen love",
    "and his face is choice Heart of Hearts,",
    "a flesh of pure fire, fusing from the center",
    "where all Motion is one.",
    "And I have known",
    "despair that the Face has ceased to stare",
    "at me with the Rose of the world",
    "but lies furled",
    "in an artificial paradise it is Hell to get into.",
    "If I knew you were there",
    "I would fall upon my knees and plead to God",
    "to deliver you in my arms once again.",
    "But it is senseless to try.",
    "One can only take means to reduce misery,",
    "confuse the sensations so that this Face,",
    "what aches in the heart and makes each new",
    "start less close to the source of desire,",
    "fade from the flesh that fires the night,",
    "with dreams and infinite longing."
