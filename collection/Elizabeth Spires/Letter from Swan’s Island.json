    "The island\u2019s dark tonight.",
    "The radio crackles with static, news",
    "of a blackout, the voice",
    "coming through first loud, then soft,",
    "as if a storm were moving",
    "to cut all lifelines off. My one-room",
    "cabin has a bed, a table, a chair.",
    "Living this way, I understand better",
    "that scene by an anonymous",
    "illuminator: a row of monks",
    "eating at a rough table, diagonals",
    "of light slicing across the room",
    "to fall, as if by accident,",
    "on their simple meal. The black",
    "and white tiles on the floor",
    "a symbol of the formal repetitions",
    "of the simplest life, or maybe",
    "an oblique allusion to a paradox",
    "of theology: the complementary nature",
    "of good and evil. Is evil possible here",
    "where everyone lives so individually",
    "and nature appears to be neutral",
    "toward everything but itself?",
    "Some mornings I wake too suddenly,",
    "the light on the wall",
    "brilliant and unfamiliar, and wonder",
    "for a moment, where am I?",
    "I answer myself, my disembodied voice",
    "high and far off",
    "like what I imagine saints and martyrs",
    "heard in moments of ecstasy:",
    "Lightheaded, I rise, make coffee,",
    "settling into the simple ceremony",
    "of another morning. Outside the sea birds",
    "pick the clam flats clean, fly off,",
    "returning late in the afternoon",
    "looking for more to scavenge.",
    "Good days, I swim in the quarry,",
    "sun myself on the rocks, and plan",
    "a diary. One entry:",
    "this place to be a rough approximation",
    "of heaven, the heaven of the lost ...",
    "But then I wonder if a diary",
    "would be superfluous and put it off.",
    "Days pass here, weeks slip away,",
    "and even when it isn\u2019t,",
    "it seems to be Sunday,",
    "irreal, subdued, the queer, slowed-down",
    "feeling of late afternoon",
    "spreading through the hours",
    "of an entire day. Impersonal, yet benign,",
    "the sun rains indiscriminately down",
    "on everything, instead of singling out",
    "particular objects, so that",
    "even the rocks out by the tide line,",
    "normally gray-brown, become",
    "false, and I have to turn away.",
    "Sometimes the lobstermen wave to me.",
    "I must seem frivolous to them,",
    "an",
    ", with my pants rolled up",
    "to the knees, standing knee-deep in water,",
    "a shell or rock in my hands.",
    "We have a code. I wave a white",
    "handkerchief above my head,",
    "they blow their foghorns back.",
    "Once means the mail\u2019s in,",
    "twice, a storm by afternoon,",
    "three times, the weather",
    "will clear by evening.",
    "But really, after a month",
    "in a place like this, there\u2019s no use",
    "to wonder",
    "the sea does this or that,",
    "what time it is, or whether",
    "the approaching storm will be a bad one.",
    "If I think of anything here,",
    "it\u2019s the peculiar way",
    "the sea gets into everything,",
    "softening the crackers I seal",
    "in an airtight jar, rotting the armchair",
    "where I sit in the evening,",
    "looking into the evening\u2019s afterlight.",
    "It smells peculiar,",
    "as if it had been tossed overboard",
    "from a dory, thought better of,",
    "and hastily retrieved.",
    "I have a fantasy: to walk on water.",
    "Not eastward, the Atlantic far out",
    "scares me, but long, island-hopping",
    "giant steps up and down",
    "the coast the way as a child",
    "I\u2019d make my \u201ctwo-legged\u201d compass",
    "walk the map. Walking to school",
    "a thousand winter mornings,",
    "I imagined each thought, each step,",
    "an exercise in good and evil;",
    "or, after confession, I\u2019d cup",
    "my hands around my breath,",
    "saved for an hour, knowing I\u2019d sin",
    "again, the scars on my soul",
    "whitening like the scars on my hands",
    "where I burnt them on the stove.",
    ". A world",
    "existing side by side with yours,",
    "where love struggles to perfect",
    "itself, and finally perfect,",
    "finds it has no object.",
    "The waking dream\u2019s intact-",
    "the world continues not to change,",
    "and staying the same, changes us."
