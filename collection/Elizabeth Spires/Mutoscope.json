    "Swirl and smash of waves against the legs",
    "and crossgirders of the pier, I have come to Brighton,",
    "come as the fathers of our fathers came,",
    "to see the past\u2019s Peep Show.",
    "On two good legs, on one, they came,",
    "veterans and stay-at-homes of the Great War,",
    "all casualties, to stroll the West Pier\u2019s promenade,",
    "past bands, flags, and minstrel shows,",
    "past Gladys Pawsey in a high-necked bathing costume",
    "riding her bicycle off the high board,",
    "past Hokey-Pokey and Electric Shocker,",
    "to the old Penny Palace, pennies burning hotly",
    "in their hands, the worn watery profile",
    "of Queen Victoria looking away from it all.",
    "I bend to the mutoscope\u2019s lit window",
    "to see \u201cWhat the Butler Saw\u201d: a woman artlessly",
    "taking off her clothes in a jerky striptease",
    "I can slow down or speed up",
    "by turning the handle of the mutoscope.",
    "Easily I raise her from darkness\u0097",
    "the eye eternally aroused by what it can\u2019t touch\u0097",
    "to watch her brief repeating performance",
    "that counts for so little. Or so much.",
    "I can\u2019t be sure which.",
    "Abruptly,",
    "shuts down the image, but her story",
    "continues as she reverses time\u2019s tawdry sequence",
    "to dress and quickly disappear",
    "down a maze of narrow streets and alleys",
    "filled with the ghostly bodies and bodiless ghosts",
    "of causality, the unredeemed and never-to-be-born",
    "bearing her along to a flight",
    "of shabby stairs, a rented room where she is free",
    "as anyone to dream her dreams and smoke a cigarette,",
    "smoke from the lit tip spiraling",
    "in patternless patterns toward the room\u2019s bare light bulb,",
    "the light I see her by harsh, violently",
    "unforgiving, as she makes tomorrow into a question",
    "of either/or: to leave this room, this vacancy",
    "forever, or go on exactly as she has before.",
    "Old ghost, your history is nameless and sexual,",
    "you are your own enigma, victim",
    "or heroine of an act of repetition that, once chosen,",
    "will choose you for a lifetime.",
    "I peer into the tunneled past,",
    "so small, so faraway and fragmentary,",
    "and yet, not unconnected to what I am now.",
    "Dilapidation upon dilapidation, Brighton",
    "is crumbling, fading to sepia tones,",
    "as your unfunny burlesque continues past",
    "your life, perhaps past mine,",
    "the past preserved and persevering,",
    "the sentimental past."
