    "I'm herdsman of a flock.",
    "The sheep are my thoughts",
    "And my thoughts are all sensations.",
    "I think with my eyes and my ears",
    "And my hands and feet",
    "And nostrils and mouth.",
    "To think a flower is to see and smell it.",
    "To eat a fruit is to sense its savor.",
    "And that is why, when I feel sad,",
    "In a day of heat, because of so much joy",
    "And lay me down in the grass to rest",
    "And close my sun-warmed eyes,",
    "I feel my whole body relaxed in reality",
    "And know the whole truth and am happy."
