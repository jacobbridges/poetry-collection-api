    "Somehow precise and unquestionable,",
    "the cut of the Chinese man\u2019s hair.",
    "Never before this certainty,",
    "I consider the decision of each strand.",

    "crashing against the hard corner of his jaw.",
    "II.",
    "I consider the darkness.",
    "You are appointed court photographer. Consider this picture.",
    "III.",
    "My small face is red behind a bath towel curtain.",
    "I watch a funeral that is taking place next door.",
    "So black, my dog,",
    "hurling himself against a chain link fence.",
    "IV.",
    "The casket is lowered and I am removing rusty pins",
    "from the grease on the window\u2019s aluminum track,",

    "pressing itself against a snowfence in my mind.",
    "Like a threat, I view the way you cut your hair",
    "as if it were a history of something small."
