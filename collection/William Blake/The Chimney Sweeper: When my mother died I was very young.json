    "When my mother died I was very young,",
    "And my father sold me while yet my tongue",
    "Could scarcely cry \" 'weep! 'weep! 'weep! 'weep!\"",
    "So your chimneys I sweep & in soot I sleep.",
    "There's little Tom Dacre, who cried when his head",
    "That curled like a lamb's back, was shaved, so I said,",
    "\"Hush, Tom! never mind it, for when your head's bare,",
    "You know that the soot cannot spoil your white hair.\"",
    "And so he was quiet, & that very night,",
    "As Tom was a-sleeping he had such a sight!",
    "That thousands of sweepers, Dick, Joe, Ned, & Jack,",
    "Were all of them locked up in coffins of black;",
    "And by came an Angel who had a bright key,",
    "And he opened the coffins & set them all free;",
    "Then down a green plain, leaping, laughing they run,",
    "And wash in a river and shine in the Sun.",
    "Then naked & white, all their bags left behind,",
    "They rise upon clouds, and sport in the wind.",
    "And the Angel told Tom, if he'd be a good boy,",
    "He'd have God for his father & never want joy.",
    "And so Tom awoke; and we rose in the dark",
    "And got with our bags & our brushes to work.",
    "Though the morning was cold, Tom was happy & warm;",
    "So if all do their duty, they need not fear harm."
