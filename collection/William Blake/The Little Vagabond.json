    "Dear Mother, dear Mother, the Church is cold,",
    "But the Ale-house is healthy & pleasant & warm;",
    "Besides I can tell where I am use'd well,",
    "Such usage in heaven will never do well.",
    "But if at the Church they would give us some Ale.",
    "And a pleasant fire, our souls to regale;",
    "We'd sing and we'd pray, all the live-long day;",
    "Nor ever once wish from the Church to stray,",
    "Then the Parson might preach & drink & sing.",
    "And we'd be as happy as birds in the spring:",
    "And modest dame Lurch, who is always at Church,",
    "Would not have bandy children nor fasting nor birch.",
    "And God like a father rejoicing to see,",
    "His children as pleasant and happy as he:",
    "Would have no more quarrel with the Devil or the Barrel",
    "But kiss him & give him both drink and apparel."
