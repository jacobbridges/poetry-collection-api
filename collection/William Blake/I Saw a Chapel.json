    "I saw a chapel all of gold",
    "That none did dare to enter in",
    "And many weeping stood without",
    "Weeping mourning worshipping",
    "I saw a serpent rise between",
    "The white pillars of the door",
    "And he forcd & forcd & forcd",
    "Down the golden hinges tore",
    "And along the pavement sweet",
    "Set with pearls and rubies bright",
    "All his slimy length he drew",
    "Till upon the altar white",
    "Vomiting his poison out",
    "On the bread & on the wine",
    "So I turnd into a sty",
    "And laid me down among the swine"
