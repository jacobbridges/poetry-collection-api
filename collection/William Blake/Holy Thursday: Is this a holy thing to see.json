    "And their sun does never shine.",
    "And their fields are bleak & bare.",
    "And their ways are fill'd with thorns.",
    "It is eternal winter there.",
    "For where-e'er the sun does shine,",
    "And where-e'er the rain does fall:",
    "Babe can never hunger there,",
    "Nor poverty the mind appall."
