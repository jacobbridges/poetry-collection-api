    "The last light of a July evening drained",
    "into the streets below: My love and I had hard",
    "things to say and hear, and we sat over",
    "wine, faltering, picking our words carefully.",
    "The afternoon before I had lain across",
    "my bed and my cat leapt up to lie",
    "alongside me, purring and slowly",
    "growing dozy. By this ritual I could",
    "clear some clutter from my baroque brain.",
    "And into that brief vacancy the image",
    "of a horse cantered, coming straight to me,",
    "and I knew it brought hard talk and hurt",
    "and fear. How did we do? A medium job,",
    "which is well above average. But because",
    "she had opened her heart to me as far",
    "as she did, I saw her fierce privacy,",
    "like a gnarled, luxuriant tree all hung",
    "with disappointments, and I knew",
    "that to love her I must love the tree",
    "and the nothing it cares for me."
