    "No day is right for the apocalypse,",
    "if you ask a housewife in Talking",
    "Rock, Georgia, or maybe Hop River,",
    "Connecticut. She is opening a plastic bag.",
    "A grotesque parody of the primeval muck",
    "starts oozing out. And behold,",
    "the plastic bag is magic;",
    "there is no closing it. Soap",
    "in unsoftened water, sewage, asbestos",
    "coiled like vermicelli, Masonite shavings,",
    "a liquefied lifetime subscription",
    "to",
    "delivered all at once.",
    "Empty body stockings, limp, forlorn,",
    "like collapsed lungs. A blithering slur",
    "of face creams, an army of photocopies",
    "travelling on its stomach of acronyms,",
    "tooth paste tubes wrung rigid and dry.",
    "Also, two hundred and one tons",
    "of crumpled bumpers wrapped in insurance",
    "claims, slag, coal dust, plastic trimmings,",
    "industrial excrementa. Lake Erie is returning",
    "our gifts.",
    "At first she thought she had won",
    "something. Now it slithers through the house,",
    "out windows, down the street, spreading",
    "everywhere but heading, mostly, west.",
    "Maybe",
    "is the wrong word,",
    "implying shape and choice. It took",
    "the shape of the landscape",
    "it rippled across like the last blanket.",
    "And it went west because the way lay open",
    "once again: not the same fecund rug",
    "the earth grew when white people scraped",
    "their first paths to the Pacific",
    "across the waves of the inland grasses.",
    "Outside Ravenswood, West Virginia,",
    "abandoned cars shine in the sun",
    "like beetlebacks. The ore it took",
    "to make the iron it took to make the steel",
    "it took to make the cars, that ore",
    "would remember the glaciers if it could.",
    "Now comes another grinding, but not\u2014",
    "thanks to our new techniques\u2014so slow.",
    "The amiable cars wait stilly in their pasture.",
    "Three Edsels forage in the southeast corner",
    "like bishops of a ruined church.",
    "There are Fords and Dodges, a Mercury",
    "on blocks, four Darts and a Pierce Arrow,",
    "a choir of silenced Chevrolets.",
    "And, showing their lapsed trademarks",
    "and proud grilles to a new westward",
    "expansion, two Hudsons, a LaSalle",
    "and a DeSoto.",
    "I was hoping to describe",
    "the colors of this industrial autumn\u2014",
    "rust, a faded purple like the dusty",
    "skin of a Concord grape, flaking moss-",
    "green paint with primer peeking",
    "blandly through, the garish macho reds",
    "insurance companies punish, the greys",
    "(opaque) and silvers (bright), the snob colors",
    "(e.g. British Racing Green), the two-tone",
    "combinations time will spurn like roadkill",
    "(1957: pink and grey), cornflower",
    "blue, naval blue, royal blue, stark blue, true",
    "blue, the blacker blue the diver sees",
    "beneath him when he plumbs thirty feet\u2014",
    "but now they are all covered,",
    "rolling and churning in the last",
    "accident, like bubbles in lava.",
    "And now my Cincinnati\u2014the hills",
    "above the river, the lawn that drained",
    "toward Ricwood Ave. like a small valley of uncles,",
    "the sultry river musk that slid",
    "like a compromising note through my bedroom window\u2014",
    "and indeed all Cincinnati seethes. The vats",
    "at Proctor & Gamble cease their slick",
    "congealing, and my beloved birthplace",
    "is but another whorl of dirt.",
    "Up north near Lebanon and Troy and Rosewood,",
    "the corn I skulked in as a boy",
    "lays back its ears like a shamed dog.",
    "Hair along the sow\u2019s spine rises.",
    "The Holstein pivots his massive head",
    "toward where the barn stood; the spreading stain",
    "he sees is his new owner.",
    "What we imagined was the fire-storm,",
    "or, failing that, the glacier.",
    "Or we hoped we\u2019d get off easy,",
    "losing only California.",
    "With the seismologists and mystics",
    "we say the last California ridge",
    "crumble into the ocean.",
    "And we were read with elegies:",
    "O California, sportswear",
    "and defense contracts, gasses that induce",
    "deference, high school girls",
    "with their own cars, we wanted",
    "to love you without pain.",
    "O California, when you were moored to us",
    "like a vast splinter of melon,",
    "like a huge and garish gondola,",
    "then we were happier, although",
    "we showed it by easy contempt.",
    "But now you are lost at sea,",
    "your cargo of mudslides and Chardonnays",
    "lost, the prints of the old movies",
    "lost, the thick unlighted candles of the redwoods",
    "snuffed in advance. On the ocean floor",
    "they lie like hands of a broken clock.",
    "O California, here we come,",
    "quoting Ecclesiastes,",
    "ruinous with self-knowledge.",
    "Meanwhile, because the muck won\u2019t stop",
    "for lamentation, Kansas succumbs.",
    "Drawn down by anklets of DDT,",
    "the jayhawk circles lower and lower",
    "while the sludge moils and crests.",
    "Now we are about to lose our voices",
    "we remember that tomorrow is our echo.",
    "O the old songs, the good days:",
    "bad faith and civil disobedience,",
    "sloppy scholarship and tooth decay.",
    "Now the age of footnotes is ours.",
    "Ibid, ibid, ibid, ibid, ibid.",
    "While the rivers thickened and fish",
    "rose like vomit, the students of water",
    "stamped each fish with its death date.",
    "Don\u2019t let a chance like this go by,",
    "they thought, though it went by",
    "as everything went by\u2014towers",
    "of water flecked by a confetti",
    "of topsoil, clucked tongues, smug",
    "prayers. What we paid too much for",
    "and too little attention to,",
    "our very lives, all jumbled",
    "now and far too big in aggregate",
    "to understand or mourn, goes by,",
    "and all our eloquence places its",
    "weight on the spare word",
    "."
