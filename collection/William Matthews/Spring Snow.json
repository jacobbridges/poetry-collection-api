    "Here comes the powdered milk I drank",
    "as a child, and the money it saved.",
    "Here come the papers I delivered,",
    "the spotted dog in heat that followed me home",
    "and the dogs that followed her.",
    "Here comes a load of white laundry",
    "from basketball practice, and sheets",
    "with their watermarks of semen.",
    "And here comes snow, a language",
    "in which no word is ever repeated,",
    "love is impossible, and remorse. . . .",
    "Yet childhood doesn\u2019t end,",
    "but accumulates, each memory",
    "knit to the next, and the fields",
    "become one field. If to die is to lose",
    "all detail, then death is not",
    "so distinguished, but a profusion",
    "of detail, a last gossip, character",
    "passed wholly into fate and fate",
    "in flecks, like dust, like flour, like snow."
