    "How easily happiness begins by",
    "dicing onions. A lump of sweet butter",
    "slithers and swirls across the floor",
    "of the saut\u00e9 pan, especially if its",
    "errant path crosses a tiny slick",
    "of olive oil. Then a tumble of onions.",
    "This could mean soup or risotto",
    "or chutney (from the Sanskrit",
    ", to lick). Slowly the onions",
    "go limp and then nacreous",
    "and then what cookbooks call clear,",
    "though if they were eyes you could see",
    "clearly the cataracts in them.",
    "It\u2019s true it can make you weep",
    "to peel them, to unfurl and to tease",
    "from the taut ball first the brittle,",
    "caramel-colored and decrepit",
    "papery outside layer, the least",
    "recent the reticent onion",
    "wrapped around its growing body,",
    "for there\u2019s nothing to an onion",
    "but skin, and it\u2019s true you can go on",
    "weeping as you go on in, through",
    "the moist middle skins, the sweetest",
    "and thickest, and you can go on",
    "in to the core, to the bud-like,",
    "acrid, fibrous skins densely",
    "clustered there, stalky and in-",
    "complete, and these are the most",
    "pungent, like the nuggets of nightmare",
    "and rage and murmury animal",
    "comfort that infant humans secrete.",
    "This is the best domestic perfume.",
    "You sit down to eat with a rumor",
    "of onions still on your twice-washed",
    "hands and lift to your mouth a hint",
    "of a story about loam and usual",
    "endurance. It\u2019s there when you clean up",
    "and rinse the wine glasses and make",
    "a joke, and you leave the minutest",
    "whiff of it on the light switch,",
    "later, when you climb the stairs."
