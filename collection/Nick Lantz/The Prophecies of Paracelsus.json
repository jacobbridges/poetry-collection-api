    "That twig of light, that branch, that",

    "Beyond that, a city. A horse drowning in",
    "a river, and beyond that, a city. Wildfire, and beyond that,",
    "a city. God, a slippery thing,",
    "an eel, is twined",
    "from our hands. That rainy hum is",
    "the wharf, is the light that etches a bridge",
    "between pronouns, the bottle",
    "of amber formaldehyde, the infant",
    "orangutan, the wing",
    "of a gull stitched to its scapula. Here is a river",
    "drowning in a horse\u2019s dark eye. Devitalized, humming, rainy,",
    "the feather of this gull, this small",
    "spill of light,",
    "the written thing that glues each hill",
    "to the earth, that follows a pull with its wobbly needle. God is",
    "a drowned horse fifty hands at the shoulder. To write what",
    "convinces with",
    "the impossible whisper. After that,",
    "a city. They call this floating thing an angel and hurry you out",
    "of the tent. A bear eating its own paws, and after",
    "this, a city. A window full",
    "of smoke, and after this, a city. A meter to measure",
    "day and time",
    "Adapted for that purpose by the God of our hands."
