    "1. Josef Mengele Drowns While Swimming at a Beach in Brazil, 1979",
    "His name then: Wolfgang Gerhard.",
    "How easy, slipping on another man\u2019s",
    "skin. Another country, too,",
    "its sun\u2019s heat and light",
    "as insistent as a pair",
    "of forceps.",
    "His pants, left crumpled",
    "on the beach, forged papers",
    "and a few hard candies in the pocket.",
    "Where the water",
    "was shallow, he could look",
    "down and see",
    "his shadow passing over",
    "the pale sand, a wobbly twin,",
    "matching him",
    "stroke for stroke for stroke.",
    "2. Li Po Drowns Trying to Embrace the Reflection of the Moon in the Yangtze, 762",
    "The moon is no drinker of wine, so I must",
    "compensate. Surely you\u2019ve heard",
    "the crows and nightingales",
    "egging me on? The day has dispersed",
    "from the courtyards like a gang",
    "of sparrows, and nothing",
    "is left of the world that is not",
    "pecked-over, hard and dark",
    "as the dream of an apple seed.",
    "The young men laugh",
    "at an old man drinking",
    "alone, but here",
    "are my companions:",
    "my shadow, as loyal",
    "and thin as a starved dog,",
    "and the moon, his whole face",
    "wrinkling with laughter.",
    "3. Bob, the Circus Seal, Drowns Himself in His Tank in Galveston, 1911",
    "By then his teeth had rotted out,",
    "and he often turned to his owner",
    "with his mouth open as if about",
    "to speak, a ruined smell",
    "jetting from inside.",
    "He had already attempted it,",
    "three days before,",
    "but his owner dove in and pulled him up",
    "onto the slimy planks. His circus show days",
    "were long gone. Sure, some afternoons",
    "a kid might walk by",
    "and see the scabby painting",
    "on the side of the building: the hoop,",
    "the pedestal, the ghost",
    "of a man in a top hat,",
    "the striped ball now like a clot",
    "of pus streaked",
    "with blood, hovering",
    "over the sleek, dark head.",
    "4. Natalie Wood Drowns under Mysterious Circumstances near Santa Catalina Island, 1981",
    "Let me tell you: death",
    "is a long silk glove",
    "dropped to the floor.",
    "It doesn\u2019t remember the heft",
    "of the arm, the fingers",
    "dancing.",
    "That limb is gone, and nothing",
    "will hold its shape again.",
    "You twirl your pastel skirt. You watch",
    "two cars",
    "race toward the cliff,",
    "and there is nothing",
    "you can do. So many lives",
    "you\u2019ve entered",
    "like a room: swooned,",
    "held the prop pistol",
    "to your own face, sang",
    "for the back row.",
    "But was it your voice?",
    "What was that name",
    "you were born into?",
    "Natalia Nikolaevna Zakharenko?",
    "What happened to her?",
    "Was she the one",
    "taken, her family butchered, living",
    "another life",
    "among the enemy people?",
    "Was it the morning?",
    "when she stopped scanning",
    "the horizon for rescuers",
    "that she turned into you?",
    "5. Hippasus of Metapontum Is Drowned at Sea for the Heresy of Discovering Irrational Numbers, ca. 500 BCE",
    "His fellow Pythagoreans had already built",
    "a shrine to his memory",
    "and placed it where",
    "he passed by every day, but he did not take",
    "the hint. It was on the ship",
    "that they seized him.",
    "God was an integer, firm",
    "as an unripe apricot.",
    "But weren\u2019t there streets",
    "in the city that wound forever",
    "into the minute darkness?",
    "Weren\u2019t there dreams where he met",
    "himself again and again,",
    "without ever seeming to wake?",
    "The sea is incommensurable.",
    "Each lungful of air",
    "kept dividing itself, even as the boat",
    "became a decimal point on the far horizon.",
    "6. Bennie Wint, 20 Years after Faking His Drowning Death, is Discovered Alive, 2009",
    "In the first years after I disappeared, I read",
    "every report of drowning: children,",
    "mostly boys,",
    "mostly in their bathtubs,",
    "mostly accidents.",
    "Old men whose lungs filled with fluid",
    "while they sat in their armchairs.",
    "Fishermen. Swimmers. Immigrants",
    "crowded onto rafts. Some men,",
    "their throats seize up,",
    "and they die without",
    "ever swallowing a drop,",
    "as if they never left the shore.",
    "Some nights I dreamed",
    "what never happened: I held my drowning",
    "in my palm like a giant pearl.",
    "Some days, standing behind",
    "the cash register of my new life,",
    "I felt my lungs flatten out like a pair",
    "of discarded socks. Did I ever think",
    "of the woman I left on the shore",
    "as I kicked out",
    "past the last of the breakers?",
    "I won\u2019t say.",
    "Here it was: I might have drowned",
    "trying to pretend to. I had to swim",
    "so far out, then mark",
    "a different beach",
    "and swim back",
    "a different man, without knowing",
    "if his strength was enough",
    "to carry me to shore."
