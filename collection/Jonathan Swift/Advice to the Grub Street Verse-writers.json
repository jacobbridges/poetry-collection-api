    "Ye poets ragged and forlorn,",
    "Down from your garrets haste;",
    "Ye rhymers, dead as soon as born,",
    "Not yet consign'd to paste;",
    "I know a trick to make you thrive;",
    "O, 'tis a quaint device:",
    "Your still-born poems shall revive,",
    "And scorn to wrap up spice.",
    "Get all your verses printed fair,",
    "Then let them well be dried;",
    "And Curll must have a special care",
    "To leave the margin wide.",
    "Lend these to paper-sparing Pope;",
    "And when he sets to write,",
    "No letter with an envelope",
    "Could give him more delight.",
    "When Pope has fill'd the margins round,",
    "Why then recall your loan;",
    "Sell them to Curll for fifty pound,",
    "And swear they are your own."
