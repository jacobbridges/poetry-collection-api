    "Headscarf fluttering in the wind,",
    "stockings hanging loose on her vein-roped",
    "legs, an old woman clings to her husband",
    "as if he were the last tree standing in a storm,",
    "though he is not the strong one.",
    "His skin is translucent\u2014more like a window",
    "than a shade. Without a shirt and coat,",
    "we could see his lungs swell and shrink,",
    "his heart skip. But he has offered her his arm,",
    "and for sixty years, she has taken it."
