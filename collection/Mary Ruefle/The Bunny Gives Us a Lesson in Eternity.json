    "We like to watch the rabbits screwing in the graveyard.",

    "who stands alone in the moonlight",

    "He looks quite desirable like that.",
    "He looks like the center of the universe.",
    "Look how his mouth moves mouthing the words",
    "while the others are busy making more of him.",
    "Soon the more will ask of him to write their love",
    "letters and he will oblige, using the language",
    "of our ancestors, those poor clouds in the ground,",
    "beloved by us who have been standing here for hours,",
    "a proud people after all."
