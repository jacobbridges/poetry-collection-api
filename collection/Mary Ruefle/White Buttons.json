    "Having been blown away",
    "by a book",
    "I am in the gutter",
    "at the end of the street",
    "in little pieces",
    "like the alphabet",
    "(mother do not worry",
    "letters are not flesh",
    "though there\u2019s meaning in them",
    "but not when they are mean",
    "my letters to you were mean",
    "I found them after you died",
    "and read them and tore them up",
    "and fed them to the wind",
    "thank you for intruding",
    "I love you now leave)",
    "Also at the end of the street",
    "there is a magnolia tree",
    "the white kind",
    "that tatters",
    "after it blooms",
    "so the tree winds up",
    "in the street",
    "Our naked shivering bodies",
    "must be at some distance",
    "missing us come back",
    "come back they cry",
    "come home",
    "put down that book",
    "whenever you read",
    "you drift away on a raft",
    "you like your parrot",
    "more than you like me",
    "and stuff like that",
    "(dear father",
    "you always were a bore",
    "but I loved you more",
    "than interesting things",
    "and in your honor",
    "I\u2019ve felt the same about myself",
    "and everyone I\u2019ve ever met)",
    "I like to read in tree houses",
    "whenever I can which is seldom",
    "and sometimes never",
    "The book that blew me away",
    "held all the problems",
    "of the world",
    "and those of being alive",
    "under my nose",
    "but I felt far away from them",
    "at the same time",
    "reading is like that",
    "(I am sorry I did not",
    "go to your funeral",
    "but like you said",
    "on the phone",
    "an insect cannot crawl",
    "to China)",
    "Here at the end of the street",
    "the insects go on living",
    "under the dome",
    "of the pacific sky",
    "If Mary and Joseph",
    "had walked the sixty miles",
    "to Bethlehem vertically",
    "they would have found",
    "themselves floating",
    "in the outer pitch of space",
    "it would have been cold",
    "no inns",
    "a long night",
    "in the dark endless",
    "and when they began to cry",
    "the whole world would think",
    "something had just been born",
    "I like to read into things",
    "as I am continually borne forward",
    "in time by the winds like the snow",
    "(dear sister",
    "you were perfect in every way",
    "like a baby",
    "please tell brother",
    "the only reason",
    "we never spoke",
    "was out of our great love",
    "for each other",
    "which made a big wind",
    "that blew us apart)",
    "I think I am coming back",
    "I feel shoulders",
    "where a parrot could land",
    "though a tree would be",
    "as good a place as any",
    "You cannot teach a tree to talk",
    "Trees can say it is spring",
    "but not though bright sunlight",
    "can also be very sad",
    "have you noticed?"
