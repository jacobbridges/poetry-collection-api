    "On our first trip to the beach together I cut my foot on sharp rocks lining the shore and watched the ocean lick the crimson clean off, the salt on my tongue a slight distraction from the deep blue, the wide open, the playground sting. I\u2019m sorry my flesh is softer than it has to be, my skin thinner than yours. I\u2019m sorry there are parts of me I have scrubbed raw, hurt; I only wanted to be polished, untainted, good",
    "as new. I\u2019m sorry I didn\u2019t see the waves crashing, didn\u2019t see any of this coming; I\u2019m sorry I wasn\u2019t careful, or strong. When the sea soaked up my blood that day I thought maybe it needed to drink too, needed to kiss, needed to need. I thought maybe you had always been right \u2014 when you drain my body of tears you also drain it of salt and dust so that you can shrink me down two sizes smaller and I can fit neatly into your life without taking up too much space, so that you can carry me with you wherever you go, to cities and mountains and valleys and all the oceans",
    "you\u2019ve never explored. Tell me, please, if you find something. Tell me if you need me to search, too. Tell me if there are places you still have to visit, things you still have to unearth. Tell me if there\u2019s any way to love you, deep blue and wide open, soft and scrubbed and thin, flesh and skin, shrinking bones, raw parts, any way at all, without letting myself bleed."
