    "O thou that swing\u2019st upon the waving hair",
    "Of some well-fill\u00e8d oaten beard,",
    "Drunk every night with a delicious tear",
    "Dropped thee from heaven, where now th\u2019 art reared;",
    "The joys of earth and air are thine entire,",
    "That with thy feet and wings dost hop and fly;",
    "And, when thy poppy works, thou dost retire",
    "To thy carved acorn-bed to lie.",
    "Up with the day, the sun thou welcom\u2019st then,",
    "Sport\u2019st in the gilt-plats of his beams,",
    "And all these merry days mak\u2019st merry men,",
    "Thyself, and melancholy streams.",
    "But ah, the sickle! Golden ears are cropped;",
    "Ceres and Bacchus bid good night;",
    "Sharp, frosty fingers all your flowers have topped,",
    "And what scythes spared, winds shave off quite.",
    "Poor verdant fool, and now green ice! thy joys,",
    "Large and as lasting as thy perch of grass,",
    "Bid us lay in \u2019gainst winter rain, and poise",
    "Their floods with an o\u2019erflowing glass.",
    "Thou best of men and friends! we will create",
    "A genuine summer in each other\u2019s breast,",
    "And spite of this cold time and frozen fate,",
    "Thaw us a warm seat to our rest.",
    "Our sacred hearths shall burn eternally,",
    "As vestal flames; the North Wind, he",
    "Shall strike his frost-stretched wings, dissolve, and fly",
    "This Etna in epitome.",
    "Dropping December shall come weeping in,",
    "Bewail th\u2019usurping of his reign:",
    "But when in showers of old Greek we begin,",
    "Shall cry he hath his crown again!",
    "Night, as clear Hesper, shall our tapers whip",
    "From the light casements where we play,",
    "And the dark hag from her black mantle strip,",
    "And stick there everlasting day.",
    "Thus richer than untempted kings are we,",
    "That, asking nothing, nothing need:",
    "Though lords of all what seas embrace, yet he",
    "That wants himself is poor indeed."
