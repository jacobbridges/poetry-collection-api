    "Out of the deep and the dark,",
    "A sparkling mystery, a shape,",
    "Something perfect,",
    "Comes like the stir of the day:",
    "One whose breath is an odor,",
    "Whose eyes show the road to stars,",
    "The breeze in his face,",
    "The glory of heaven on his back.",
    "He steps like a vision hung in air,",
    "Diffusing the passion of eternity;",
    "His abode is the sunlight of morn,",
    "The music of eve his speech:",
    "In his sight,",
    "One shall turn from the dust of the grave,",
    "And move upward to the woodland."
