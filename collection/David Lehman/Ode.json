    "People in the middle ages didn't think they were living",
    "Between two more important and enlightened eras;",
    "Nor did they see themselves as the players",
    "In act three of a tragedy in five acts.",
    "It was not always late winter in the middle ages.",
    "People in the middle ages were not all middle-aged",
    "Though it is enjoyable on occasion to assume that they were.",
    "The sun was as bright in the dark ages",
    "As it is now\u2014maybe a fraction brighter, in fact.",
    "Think of the middle ages and what do you see:",
    "Gloomy cathedrals, students dressed like monks in the rain,",
    "Or a band of drunken pilgrims telling obscene jokes,",
    "Or heroes embarking for the nearest wilderness come April?",
    "Your answer will reveal yourself to yourself",
    "But you may not know it\u2014may choose to hide",
    "In hazy visions of a serene and indescribable paradise.",
    "And paradise, as we all know, may be paradise when we\u2019re dead,",
    "But is boredom on earth, alas.",
    "We never think of ennui in relation to the middle ages.",
    "Should we? Did Thomas Aquinas never get bored",
    "Cooking up elaborate refutations of diminutive heresies?",
    "No, and you shouldn\u2019t either. Nor did the clerks",
    "of Oxford tire of the sin against the Holy Ghost,",
    "Trying to figure out what it was.",
    "On chill September mornings when",
    "I smoked too much the night before",
    "And I drank too much the night before",
    "And a sinister cough rises up",
    "From the depths of the belly of my being,",
    "I like to imagine living in Provence",
    "Or even in Rheims during the middle ages.",
