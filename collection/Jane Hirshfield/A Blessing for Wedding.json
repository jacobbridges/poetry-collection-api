    "Today when persimmons ripen",
    "Today when fox-kits come out of their den into snow",
    "Today when the spotted egg releases its wren song",
    "Today when the maple sets down its red leaves",
    "Today when windows keep their promise to open",
    "Today when fire keeps its promise to warm",
    "Today when someone you love has died",
    "or someone you never met has died",
    "Today when someone you love has been born",
    "or someone you will not meet has been born",
    "Today when rain leaps to the waiting of roots in their dryness",
    "Today when starlight bends to the roofs of the hungry and tired",
    "Today when someone sits long inside his last sorrow",
    "Today when someone steps into the heat of her first embrace",
    "Today, let this light bless you",
    "With these friends let it bless you",
    "With snow-scent and lavender bless you",
    "Let the vow of this day keep itself wildly and wholly",
    "Spoken and silent, surprise you inside your ears",
    "Sleeping and waking, unfold itself inside your eyes",
    "Let its fierceness and tenderness hold you",
    "Let its vastness be undisguised in all your days"
