    "The woodpecker keeps returning",
    "to drill the house wall.",
    "Put a pie plate over one place, he chooses another.",
    "There is nothing good to eat there:",
    "he has found in the house",
    "a resonant billboard to post his intentions,",
    "his voluble strength as provider.",
    "But where is the female he drums for? Where?",
    "I ask this, who am myself the ruined siding,",
    "the handsome red-capped bird, the missing mate."
