    "You are trying to solve a problem.",
    "You\u2019re almost certainly halfway done,",
    "maybe more.",
    "You take some salt, some alum,",
    "and put it into the problem.",
    "Its color goes from yellow to royal blue.",
    "You tie a knot of royal blue into the problem,",
    "as into a Peruvian quipu of colored string.",
    "You enter the problem\u2019s bodegas,",
    "its flea markets, souks.",
    "Amid the alleys of sponges and sweets,",
    "of jewelry, spices, and hair combs,",
    "you ponder which stall, which pumpkin or perfume, is yours.",
    "You go inside the problem\u2019s piano.",
    "You choose three keys.",
    "One surely must open the door of the problem,",
    "if only you knew only this:",
    "is the quandary edible or medical,",
    "a problem of reason or grief?",
    "It is looking back at you now",
    "with the quizzical eyes of a young, bright dog.",
    "Her whole body pitched for the fetch,",
    "the dog wants to please.",
    "If only she could ascertain which direction,",
    "what object, which scent of riddle,",
    "and if the problem is round or elliptical in its orbit,",
    "and if it is measured in foot-pounds, memory, or meat."
