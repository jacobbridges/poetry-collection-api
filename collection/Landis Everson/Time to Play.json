    "Now it's time to play. Nobody says,",
    "like they used to, but in my bones",
    "the desire overwhelms me. \"Write!",
    "Make a poem,\" say the bones.",
    "The inlet will come first. It always does.",
    "Water calls urgently, \"egret.\" The waterbird",
    "that moves elastically over the surface",
    "making everything focus soon or late.",
    "Now my hand enters. It always does.",
    "It gives the bones reason to observe.",
    "It makes the egret the finest thing in sight",
    "and the water intelligent north of here.",
    "Water is genius because it is interconnected.",
    "Drop south knows drop north.",
    "But the bones will lose their joy",
    "if the bird overwhelms the old playground."
