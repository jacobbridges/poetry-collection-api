    "Valentine, valentine you arrive",
    "in a town car with a chauffered envelope,",
    "scattered pieces of you enrolled in schoolyards",
    "like a recess of paper vanity, litter, old",
    "with red-rimmed \"loves,\" red-rhymed lies in lace.",
    "The verses come, rising as easily as long-stemmed snakes in",
    "bloom where swamps settle down and drowse",
    "by dawn, a night of secrets slid out of drawers like knives nesting, a choice of chimes and slums overrun",
    "by bejeweled heartbreakers. What a lovely",
    "winter, almost skipping February."
