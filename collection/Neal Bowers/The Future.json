    "Because the jobs were there",
    "and a man could get rich",
    "working on the line, the South",
    "retreated North to Michigan,",
    "whole families eating crackers and baloney",
    "by the side of the road,",
    "changing drivers to keep",
    "moving through corn fields",
    "and foreign towns,",
    "sundown and darkness,",
    "the moon a prophecy of chrome,",
    "the stars 10 million headlights",
    "of the cars they would build.",
    "Ahead lay a city bright with steel;",
    "behind, the dark fields folded",
    "over everything they knew;",
    "and when they dozed",
    "on cramped back seats, they dreamed",
    "such dreams as the road can make,",
    "of drifting on a lake or stream",
    "or lying down in hay to dream of traveling,",
    "so that when they woke to a bump,",
    "a couch, a voice saying, \u201cIt\u2019s your turn,\u201d",
    "they were lost to themselves",
    "and took a few moments",
    "to remember their names.",
    "Mostly behind their backs,",
    "the locals called them",
    "rednecks, crackers, goddamned rebs.",
    "Strange to be strange,",
    "in their new neighborhoods,",
    "to be ethnic with a thick accent",
    "and a taste for food the grocers didn\u2019t stock\u2014",
    "hog jowl and blackeyes, turnip greens,",
    "roasting ears, souse-meat\u2014",
    "the butcher shrugging,",
    "the produce man shaking his head.",
    "Sometimes their own voices",
    "took them by surprise,",
    "sounding odd and out of place",
    "in the din of a city bus, ringing",
    "lost in the evening air when",
    "they called their children in for supper.",
    "At work they touched",
    "parts of tomorrow,",
    "next year\u2019s models always",
    "taking shape and vanishing,",
    "the present obsolete, the past",
    "merely a rumor,",
    "all hours blurring",
    "into one continuous moment",
    "of finishing a fragment,",
    "each piece the same piece,",
    "movements identical,",
    "endless, like a punishment in hell.",
    "No way out but back",
    "to their old lives, a future",
    "they already knew by heart,",
    "a few on the road each month",
    "in cars they may have helped assemble,",
    "tokens of their failed success,",
    "legacies for boys to find",
    "years later rusting on some lot,",
    "banged up but still a dream",
    "and fast enough when overhauled",
    "to make them feel they could blast",
    "straight into tomorrow,",
    "as they raced their engines at each stoplight",
    "and cruised their towns in circles."
