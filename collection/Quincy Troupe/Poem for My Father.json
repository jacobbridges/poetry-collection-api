    "father, it was an honor to be there, in the dugout",
    "with you, the glory of great black men swinging their lives",
    "as bats, at tiny white balls",
    "burning in at unbelievable speeds, riding up & in & out",
    "a curve breaking down wicked, like a ball falling off a table",
    "moving away, snaking down, screwing its stitched magic",
    "into chitlin circuit air, its comma seams spinning",
    "toward breakdown, dipping, like a hipster",
    "bebopping a knee-dip stride, in the charlie parker forties",
    "wrist curling, like a swan\u2019s neck",
    "behind a slick black back",
    "cupping an invisible ball of dreams",
    "& you there, father, regal, as an african, obeah man",
    "sculpted out of wood, from a sacred tree, of no name, no place, origin",
    "thick branches branching down, into cherokee & someplace else lost",
    "way back in africa, the sap running dry",
    "crossing from north carolina into georgia, inside grandmother mary\u2019s",
    "womb, where your mother had you in the violence of that red soil",
    "ink blotter news, gone now, into blood graves",
    "of american blues, sponging rococo",
    "truth long gone as dinosaurs",
    "the agent-oranged landscape of former names",
    "absent of african polysyllables, dry husk, consonants there",
    "now, in their place, names, flat, as polluted rivers",
    "& that guitar string smile always snaking across",
    "some virulent, american, redneck\u2019s face",
    "scorching, like atomic heat, mushrooming over nagasaki",
    "& hiroshima, the fever blistered shadows of it all",
    "inked, as etchings, into sizzled concrete",
    "but you, there, father, through it all, a yardbird solo",
    "riffing on bat & ball glory, breaking down the fabricated myths",
    "of white major league legends, of who was better than who",
    "beating them at their own crap",
    "game, with killer bats, as bud powell swung his silence into beauty",
    "of a josh gibson home run, skittering across piano keys of bleachers",
    "shattering all manufactured legends up there in lights",
    "struck out white knights, on the risky edge of amazement",
    "awe, the miraculous truth sluicing through",
    "steeped & disguised in the blues",
    "confluencing, like the point at the cross",
    "when a fastball hides itself up in a slider, curve",
    "breaking down & away in a wicked, sly grin",
    "curved & posed as an ass-scratching uncle tom, who",
    "like old sachel paige delivering his famed hesitation pitch",
    "before coming back with a hard, high, fast one, is slicker",
    "sliding, & quicker than a professional hitman\u2014",
    "the deadliness of it all, the sudden strike",
    "like that of the \u201cbrown bomber\u2019s\u201d crossing right",
    "of sugar ray robinson\u2019s, lightning, cobra bite",
    "& you, there, father, through it all, catching rhythms",
    "of chono pozo balls, drumming, like conga beats into your catcher\u2019s mitt",
    "hard & fast as \u201ccool papa\u201d bell jumping into bed",
    "before the lights went out",
    "of the old, negro baseball league, a promise, you were",
    "father, a harbinger, of shock waves, soon come"
