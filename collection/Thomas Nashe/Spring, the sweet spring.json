    "Spring, the sweet spring, is the year\u2019s pleasant king,",
    "Then blooms each thing, then maids dance in a ring,",
    "Cold doth not sting, the pretty birds do sing:",
    "Cuckoo, jug-jug, pu-we, to-witta-woo!",
    "The palm and may make country houses gay,",
    "Lambs frisk and play, the shepherds pipe all day,",
    "And we hear aye birds tune this merry lay:",
    "Cuckoo, jug-jug, pu-we, to-witta-woo!",
    "The fields breathe sweet, the daisies kiss our feet,",
    "Young lovers meet, old wives a-sunning sit,",
    "In every street these tunes our ears do greet:",
    "Cuckoo, jug-jug, pu-we, to witta-woo!",
    "Spring, the sweet spring!"
