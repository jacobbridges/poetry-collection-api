    "I look through glass and see a young woman",
    "of twenty, washing dishes, and the window",
    "turns into a painting. She is myself thirty years ago.",
    "She holds the same blue bowls and brass teapot",
    "I still own. I see her outline against lamplight;",
    "she knows only her side of the pane. The porch",
    "where I stand is empty. Sunlight fades. I hear",
    "water run in the sink as she lowers her head,",
    "blind to the future. She does not imagine I exist.",
    "I step forward for a better look and she dissolves",
    "into lumber and paint. A gate I passed through",
    "to the next life loses shape. Once more I stand",
    "squared into the present, among maple trees",
    "and scissor-tailed birds, in a garden, almost",
    "a mother to that faint, distant woman."
