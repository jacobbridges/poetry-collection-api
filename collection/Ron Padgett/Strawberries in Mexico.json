    "At 14th Street and First Avenue",
    "Is a bank and in the bank the sexiest teller of all time",
    "Next to her the greatest thing about today",
    "Is today itself",
    "Through which I go up",
    "To buy books",
    "They float by under a bluer sky",
    "The girls uptown",
    "Quiet, pampered",
    "The sum of all that's terrible in women",
    "And much of the best",
    "And the old men go by holding small packages",
    "In a trance",
    "So rich even",
    "can't believe it",
    "I think it's a red, white, and blue letter day for them too",
    "You see, Con Ed's smokestacks",
    "beautiful",
    "The way Queens is",
    "And horses: from a pleasant distance",
    "Or a fleet of turkeys",
    "Stuffed in a spotless window",
    "In two days they'll be sweating in ovens",
    "Thinking, \"How did I ever get in a fix like this?\"",
    "Light pouring over buildings far away",
    "Up here when someone shouts \"Hey!\"",
    "In the street you know that they aren't going to kill you",
    "They're yelling to a friend of theirs named Hey",
    "John David Hey, perhaps",
    "And the garbage goes out",
    "In big white billowy plastic bags tied at the top",
    "And even the people go out in them",
    "Some are waiting now",
    "At the bus stop (for a nonexistent bus)",
    "And I thought it was garbage!",
    "It's so pretty!",
    "If you're classless or modern",
    "You can have fun by",
    "Walking into a high-class antique store",
    "So the stately old snob at the desk will ask",
    "In eternity",
    "\"You're going where?\"",
    "You get to answer, \"Up.\"",
    "I like these old pricks",
    "If you have an extra hair in the breeze",
    "Their eyes pop out",
    "And then recede way back",
    "As if to say, \"That person is on . . . dope!\"",
    "They're very correct",
    "But they're not in my shoes",
    "In front of a Dubuffet a circus that shines through",
    "A window in a bright all-yellow building",
    "The window is my eye",
    "And Frank O'Hara is the building",
    "I'm thinking about him like mad today",
    "(As anyone familiar with his poetry will tell)",
    "And about the way Madison Avenue really",
    "Does go to heaven",
    "And turns around and comes back, disappointed",
    "Because up here you can look down on the janitor",
    "Or pity him",
    "And rent a cloud-colored Bentley and",
    "Architecture's so wonderful!",
    "Why don't I notice it more often?",
    "And the young girls and boys but especially the young girls",
    "Are drifting away from school",
    "In blue and white wool",
    "Wrapped in fur",
    "Are they French? They're speaking French!",
    "And they aren't looking for things to throw",
    "Skirts sliding up the legs of girls who can't keep from grinning",
    "Under beautiful soft brown American eyes",
    "At the whole world",
    "Which includes their Plain Jane girlfriends",
    "She even smiled at me!",
    "I have about as much chance of fucking her as the girl at the bank",
    "But I stride along, a terrifying god",
    "Raunchy",
    "A little one-day-old beard",
    "And good grief I really did forget to brush my teeth this morning",
    "They're turning red with embarrassment",
    "Or is that blood",
    "I've been drinking\u2014I ordered a black coffee",
    "Miss",
    "And then a black policeman comes in",
    "Unbuttoning his uniform at the warmish soda fountain",
    "While I pull the fleece over my teeth",
    "And stare innocently at the books I've bought",
    "One a book with a drawing",
    "By Apollinaire called",
    "But when I open the book to that page",
    "It's just a very blue sky I'm looking at"
