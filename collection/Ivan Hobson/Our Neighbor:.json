    "Every family that lived in our court",
    "had an American truck",
    "with a union sticker on the back",
    "and as a kid I admired them",
    "the way I thought our soldiers",
    "must have admired Patton",
    "and Sherman tanks.",
    "You once told me",
    "that the Russians couldn\u2019t take us,",
    "not with towns like ours",
    "full of iron, full of workers tempered",
    "by the fires of foundries and mills.",
    "It wasn\u2019t the Russians that came;",
    "it was the contract, the strike,",
    "the rounds of layoffs that blistered",
    "until your number was called.",
    "I still remember you loading up",
    "to leave for the last time,",
    "the union sticker scraped off",
    "with a putty knife,",
    "the end of the white tarp draped",
    "over your truck bed",
    "flapping as you drove away."
