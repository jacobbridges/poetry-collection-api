    "I am four in this photograph, standing",
    "on a wide strip of Mississippi beach,",
    "my hands on the flowered hips",
    "of a bright bikini. My toes dig in,",
    "curl around wet sand. The sun cuts",
    "the rippling Gulf in flashes with each",
    "tidal rush. Minnows dart at my feet",
    "glinting like switchblades. I am alone",
    "except for my grandmother, other side",
    "of the camera, telling me how to pose.",
    "It is 1970, two years after they opened",
    "the rest of this beach to us,",
    "forty years since the photograph",
    "where she stood on a narrow plot",
    "of sand marked",
    ", smiling,",
    "her hands on the flowered hips",
    "of a cotton meal-sack dress."
