    "I think by now the river must be thick",
    "with salmon. Late August, I imagine it",
    "as it was that morning: drizzle needling",
    "the surface, mist at the banks like a net",
    "settling around us \u2014 everything damp",
    "and shining. That morning, awkward",
    "and heavy in our hip waders, we stalked",
    "into the current and found our places \u2014",
    "you upstream a few yards and out",
    "far deeper. You must remember how",
    "the river seeped in over your boots",
    "and you grew heavier with that defeat.",
    "All day I kept turning to watch you, how",
    "first you mimed our guide's casting",
    "then cast your invisible line, slicing the sky",
    "between us; and later, rod in hand, how",
    "you tried \u2014 again and again \u2014 to find",
    "that perfect arc, flight of an insect",
    "skimming the river's surface. Perhaps",
    "you recall I cast my line and reeled in",
    "two small trout we could not keep.",
    "Because I had to release them, I confess,",
    "I thought about the past \u2014 working",
    "the hooks loose, the fish writhing",
    "in my hands, each one slipping away",
    "before I could let go. I can tell you now",
    "that I tried to take it all in, record it",
    "for an elegy I'd write \u2014 one day \u2014",
    "when the time came. Your daughter,",
    "I was that ruthless. What does it matter",
    "if I tell you I",
    "to be? You kept casting",
    "your line, and when it did not come back",
    "empty, it was tangled with mine. Some nights,",
    "dreaming, I step again into the small boat",
    "that carried us out and watch the bank receding \u2014",
    "my back to where I know we are headed."
