    "Mittens are drying on the radiator,",
    "boots nearby, one on its side.",
    "Like some monstrous segmented insect",
    "the radiator elongates under the window.",
    "Or it is a beast with many shoulders",
    "domesticated in the Ice Age.",
    "How many years it takes",
    "to move from room to room!",
    "Some cage their radiators",
    "but this is unnecessary",
    "as they have little desire to escape.",
    "Like turtles they are quite self-contained.",
    "If they seem sad, it is only the same sadness",
    "we all feel, unlovely, growing slowly cold."
