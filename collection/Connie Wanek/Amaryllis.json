    "A flower needs to be this size",
    "to conceal the winter window,",
    "and this color, the red",
    "of a Fiat with the top down,",
    "to impress us, dull as we've grown.",
    "Months ago the gigantic onion of a bulb",
    "half above the soil",
    "stuck out its green tongue",
    "and slowly, day by day,",
    "the flower itself entered our world,",
    "closed, like hands that captured a moth,",
    "then open, as eyes open,",
    "and the amaryllis, seeing us,",
    "was somehow undiscouraged.",
    "It stands before us now",
    "as we eat our soup;",
    "you pour a little of your drinking water",
    "into its saucer, and a few crumbs",
    "of fragrant earth fall",
    "onto the tabletop."
