    "Now when I walk around at lunchtime",
    "I have only two charms in my pocket",
    "an old Roman coin Mike Kanemitsu gave me",
    "and a bolt-head that broke off a packing case",
    "when I was in Madrid the others never",
    "brought me too much luck though they did",
    "help keep me in New York against coercion",
    "but now I'm happy for a time and interested",
    "I walk through the luminous humidity",
    "passing the House of Seagram with its wet",
    "and its loungers and the construction to",
    "the left that closed the sidewalk if",
    "I ever get to be a construction worker",
    "I'd like to have a silver hat please",
    "and get to Moriarty's where I wait for",
    "LeRoi and hear who wants to be a mover and",
    "shaker the last five years my batting average",
    "is .016 that's that, and LeRoi comes in",
    "and tells me Miles Davis was clubbed 12",
    "times last night outside",
    "by a cop",
    "a lady asks us for a nickel for a terrible",
    "disease but we don't give her one we",
    "don't like terrible diseases, then",
    "we go eat some fish and some ale it's",
    "cool but crowded we don't like Lionel Trilling",
    "we decide, we like Don Allen we don't like",
    "Henry James so much we like Herman Melville",
    "we don't want to be in the poets' walk in",
    "San Francisco even we just want to be rich",
    "and walk on girders in our silver hats",
    "I wonder if one person out of the 8,000,000 is",
    "thinking of me as I shake hands with LeRoi",
    "and buy a strap for my wristwatch and go",
    "back to work happy at the thought possibly so"
