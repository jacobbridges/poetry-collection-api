    "I wanted to be sure to reach you;",
    "though my ship was on the way it got caught",
    "in some moorings. I am always tying up",
    "and then deciding to depart. In storms and",
    "at sunset, with the metallic coils of the tide",
    "around my fathomless arms, I am unable",
    "to understand the forms of my vanity",
    "or I am hard alee with my Polish rudder",
    "in my hand and the sun sinking. To",
    "you I offer my hull and the tattered cordage",
    "of my will. The terrible channels where",
    "the wind drives me against the brown lips",
    "of the reeds are not all behind me. Yet",
    "I trust the sanity of my vessel; and",
    "if it sinks, it may well be in answer",
    "to the reasoning of the eternal voices,",
    "the waves which have kept me from reaching you."
