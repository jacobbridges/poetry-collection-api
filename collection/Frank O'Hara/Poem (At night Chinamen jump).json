    "At night Chinamen jump",
    "on Asia with a thump",
    "while in our willful way",
    "we, in secret, play",
    "affectionate games and bruise",
    "our knees like China\u2019s shoes.",
    "The birds push apples through",
    "grass the moon turns blue,",
    "these apples roll beneath",
    "our buttocks like a heath",
    "full of Chinese thrushes",
    "flushed from China\u2019s bushes.",
    "As we love at night",
    "birds sing out of sight,",
    "Chinese rhythms beat",
    "through us in our heat,",
    "the apples and the birds",
    "move us like soft words,",
    "we couple in the grace",
    "of that mysterious race."
