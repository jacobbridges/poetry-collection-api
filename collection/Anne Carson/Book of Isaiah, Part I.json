    "Isaiah addressed the nation.",
    "Man\u2019s brittleness! cried Isaiah.",

    "Who can invent a new fear?",
    "Yet I have invented sin, thought Isaiah, running his hand over the knobs.",

    "You, said Isaiah.",
    "No answer.",
    "I cannot hear you, Isaiah spoke again under the Branch.",
    "Light bleached open the night camera.",
    "God arrived.",
    "God smashed Isaiah like glass through every socket of his nation.",
    "Liar! said God.",
    "Isaiah put his hands on his coat, he put his hand on his face.",
    "Isaiah is a small man, said Isaiah, but no liar.",
    "God paused.",
    "And so that was their contract.",
    "Brittle on both sides, no lying.",
    "Isaiah\u2019s wife came to the doorway, the doorposts had moved.",
    "What\u2019s that sound? said Isaiah\u2019s wife.",
    "The fear of the Lord, said Isaiah.",
    "He grinned in the dark, she went back inside."
