    "up the hill to his house, shadows",
    "of limes and roses blowing in the car window",
    "and music spraying from the radio and him",
    "singing and touching my left hand to his lips.",
    "Law lived in a high blue room from which he could see the sea.",
    "Time in its transparent loops as it passes beneath me now",
    "still carries the sound of the telephone in that room",
    "and traffic far off and doves under the window",
    "chuckling coolly and his voice saying,",
    "You beauty. I can feel that beauty\u2019s",
    "heart beating inside mine as she presses into his arms in the high blue room\u2014",

    "as Charlotte Bront\u00eb says of",
    ".",
    "Charlotte\u2019s preface to",
    "is a publicist\u2019s masterpiece.",

    "crouched on the arm of the sofa Charlotte",
    "talks firmly and calmly",
    "about the other furniture of Emily\u2019s workshop\u2014about",

    "continues to speak helpfully about lightning",
    "and other weather we may expect to experience",
    "when we enter Emily\u2019s electrical atmosphere.",
    "It is \u201ca horror of great darkness\u201d that awaits us there",

    "\u201cHaving formed these beings she did not know what she had done,\u201d",
    "says Charlotte (of Heathcliff and Earnshaw and Catherine).",
    "Well there are many ways of being held prisoner.",
    "The scorpion takes a light spring and lands on our left knee",
    "as Charlotte concludes, \u201cOn herself she had no pity.\u201d",
    "Pitiless too are the Heights, which Emily called Wuthering",
    "because of their \u201cbracing ventilation\u201d",
    "and \u201ca north wind over the edge.\u201d",
    "Whaching a north wind grind the moor",
    "that surrounded her father\u2019s house on every side,",
    "formed of a kind of rock called millstone grit,",
    "taught Emily all she knew about love and its necessities\u2014",
    "an angry education that shapes the way her characters",
    "use one another. \u201cMy love for Heathcliff,\u201d says Catherine,",
    "\u201cresembles the eternal rocks beneath",
    "a source of little visible delight, but necessary.\u201d",
    "Necessary? I notice the sun has dimmed",
    "and the afternoon air sharpening.",

    "What are the imperatives",
    "that hold people like Catherine and Heathcliff",
    "together and apart, like pores blown into hot rock",
    "and then stranded out of reach",
    "of one another when it hardens? What kind of necessity is that?",
    "The last time I saw Law was a black night in September.",
    "Autumn had begun,",
    "my knees were cold inside my clothes.",
    "A chill fragment of moon rose.",
    "He stood in my living room and spoke",
    "without looking at me. Not enough spin on it,",
    "he said of our five years of love.",
    "Inside my chest I felt my heart snap into two pieces",
    "which floated apart. By now I was so cold",
    "it was like burning. I put out my hand",
    "to touch his. He moved back.",
    "I don\u2019t want to be sexual with you, he said. Everything gets crazy.",
    "But now he was looking at me.",

    "stretched like a surface of millstone grit between body and mind,",
    "where such necessity grinds itself out.",
    "Soul is what I kept watch on all that night.",
    "Law stayed with me.",
    "We lay on top of the covers as if it weren\u2019t really a night of sleep and time,",
    "caressing and singing to one another in our made-up language",
    "like the children we used to be.",
    "That was a night that centred Heaven and Hell,",
    "as Emily would say. We tried to fuck",
    "but he remained limp, although happy. I came",
    "again and again, each time accumulating lucidity,",
    "until at last I was floating high up near the ceiling looking down",
    "on the two souls clasped there on the bed",
    "with their mortal boundaries",
    "visible around them like lines on a map.",
    "I saw the lines harden.",
    "He left in the morning.",
    "It is very cold",
    "walking into the long scraped April wind.",
    "At this time of year there is no sunset",
    "just some movements inside the light and then a sinking away.",

    "from beneath a wily arrangement of leftover blocks of Christmas cake",
    "wrapped in foil and prescription medicine bottles",
    "I close the fridge door. Bluish dusk",
    "fills the room like a sea slid back.",
    "I lean against the sink.",
    "White foods taste best to me",
    "and I prefer to eat alone. I don\u2019t know why.",

    "When she felt herself alone.",
    "Girls are cruelest to themselves.",
    "Someone like Emily Bront\u00eb,",
    "who remained a girl all her life despite her body as a woman,",
    "had cruelty drifted up in all the cracks of her like spring snow.",
    "We can see her ridding herself of it at various times",
    "with a gesture like she used to brush the carpet.",

    "them directly to her arm.",
    "Cauterization of Heathcliff took longer.",
    "More than thirty years in the time of the novel,",
    "from the April evening when he runs out the back door of the kitchen",
    "and vanishes over the moor",
    "because he overheard half a sentence of Catherine\u2019s",
    "(\u201cIt would degrade me to marry Heathcliff\u201d)",

    "devil,",
    "came to her in a kindly firelit kitchen",
    "(\u201ckichin\u201d in Emily\u2019s spelling) where she",

    "What is love?",
    "My questions were not original.",
    "Nor did I answer them.",

    "Nude #11. Ledge in outer space.",
    "Space is bluish black and glossy as solid water",
    "and moving very fast in all directions,",
    "shrieking past the woman who stands pinned",
    "to nothing by its pressure.",
    "She peers and glances for some way to go, trying to lift her hand but cannot.",
    "Nude #12. Old pole in the wind.",
    "Cold currents are streaming over it",
    "and pulling out",
    "into ragged long horizontal black lines",
    "some shreds of ribbon",
    "attached to the pole.",
    "I cannot see how they are attached\u2014",
    "notches? staples? nails? All of a sudden the wind changes",
    "and all the black shreds rise straight up in the air",
    "and tie themselves into knots,",
    "then untie and float down.",
    "The wind is gone.",
    "It waits.",
    "By this time, midway through winter,",
    "I had become entirely fascinated with my spiritual melodrama.",
    "Then it stopped.",
    "Days passed, months passed and I saw nothing.",
    "I continued to peer and glance, sitting on the rug in front of my sofa",
    "in the curtainless morning",
    "with my nerves open to the air like something skinned.",
    "I saw nothing.",
    "Outside the window spring storms came and went.",
    "April snow folded its huge white paws over doors and porches.",
    "I watched a chunk of it lean over the roof and break off",
    "and fall and I thought,",
    "How slow! as it glided soundlessly past,",
    "but still\u2014nothing. No nudes.",
    "No Thou.",
    "A great icicle formed on the railing of my balcony",
    "so I drew up close to the window and tried peering through the icicle,",
    "hoping to trick myself into some interior vision,",
    "but all I saw",
    "was the man and woman in the room across the street",
    "making their bed and laughing.",
    "I stopped watching.",
    "I forgot about Nudes.",
    "I lived my life,",
    "which felt like a switched-off TV.",

    "A soul can do that.",
    "Whether it goes to join Thou and sit on the porch for all eternity",
    "enjoying jokes and kisses and beautiful cold spring evenings,",
    "you and I will never know. But I can tell you what I saw.",
    "Nude #13 arrived when I was not watching for it.",
    "It came at night.",
    "Very much like Nude #1.",
    "And yet utterly different.",
    "I saw a high hill and on it a form shaped against hard air.",
    "It could have been just a pole with some old cloth attached,",
    "but as I came closer",
    "I saw it was a human body",
    "trying to stand against winds so terrible that the flesh was blowing off the bones.",
    "And there was no pain.",
    "The wind",
    "was cleansing the bones.",
    "They stood forth silver and necessary.",
    "It was not my body, not a woman\u2019s body, it was the body of us all.",
    "It walked out of the light."
