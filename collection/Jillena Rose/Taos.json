    "Bones are easier to find than flowers",
    "in the desert, so I paint these:",
    "Fine white skulls of cows and horses.",
    "When I lie flat under the stars",
    "in the back of the car, coyotes howling",
    "in the scrub pines, easy to feel how those bones",
    "are so much like mine: Here is my pelvis,",
    "like the pelvis I found today",
    "bleached by the sun and the sand. Same",
    "hole where the hip would go, same",
    "white curve of bone beneath my flesh",
    "same cradle of life, silent and still in me."
