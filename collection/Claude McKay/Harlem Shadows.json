    "I hear the halting footsteps of a lass",
    "In Negro Harlem when the night lets fall",
    "Its veil. I see the shapes of girls who pass",
    "To bend and barter at desire's call.",
    "Ah, little dark girls who in slippered feet",
    "Go prowling through the night from street to street!",
    "Through the long night until the silver break",
    "Of day the little gray feet know no rest;",
    "Through the lone night until the last snow-flake",
    "Has dropped from heaven upon the earth's white breast,",
    "The dusky, half-clad girls of tired feet",
    "Are trudging, thinly shod, from street to street.",
    "Ah, stern harsh world, that in the wretched way",
    "Of poverty, dishonor and disgrace,",
    "Has pushed the timid little feet of clay,",
    "The sacred brown feet of my fallen race!",
    "Ah, heart of me, the weary, weary feet",
    "In Harlem wandering from street to street."
