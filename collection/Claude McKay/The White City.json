    "I will not toy with it nor bend an inch.",
    "Deep in the secret chambers of my heart",
    "I muse my life-long hate, and without flinch",
    "I bear it nobly as I live my part.",
    "My being would be a skeleton, a shell,",
    "If this dark Passion that fills my every mood,",
    "And makes my heaven in the white world\u2019s hell,",
    "Did not forever feed me vital blood.",
    "I see the mighty city through a mist\u2014",
    "The strident trains that speed the goaded mass,",
    "The poles and spires and towers vapor-kissed,",
    "The fortressed port through which the great ships pass,",
    "The tides, the wharves, the dens I contemplate,",
    "Are sweet like wanton loves because I hate."
