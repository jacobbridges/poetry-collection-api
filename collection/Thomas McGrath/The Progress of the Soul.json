    "Where once I loved my flesh,",
    "That social fellow,",
    "Now I want security of bone",
    "And cherish the silence of my skeleton.",
    "Where once I walked the world",
    "Hunting the devil,",
    "Now I find the darkness and the void",
    "Within my side.",
    "First to be good, then to be happy I",
    "Worked and prayed.",
    "Before the midnight, like the foul fiend,",
    "I killed my dear friend.",
    "Hope unto hope, dream beyond monstrous dream",
    "I sought the world.",
    "Now, at the black pitch and midnight of despair,",
    "I find it was always here."
