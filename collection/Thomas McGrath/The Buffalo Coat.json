    "I see him moving, in his legendary fleece,",
    "Between the superhighway and an Algonquin stone axe;",
    "Between the wild tribes, in their lost heat,",
    "And the dark blizzard of my Grandfather\u2019s coat;",
    "Cold with the outdoor cold caught in the curls,",
    "Smelling of the world before the poll tax.",
    "And between the new macadam and the Scalp Act",
    "They got him by the short hair; had him clipped",
    "Who once was wild\u2014and all five senses wild\u2014",
    "Printing the wild with his hoof\u2019s inflated script",
    "Before the times was money in the bank,",
    "Before it was a crime to be so mild.",
    "But history is a fact, and moves on feet",
    "Sharper than his, toward wallows deeper than.",
    "And the myth that covered all his moving parts,",
    "Grandfather\u2019s time had turned into a coat;",
    "And what kept warm then, in the true world\u2019s cold",
    "Is old and cold in a world his death began."
