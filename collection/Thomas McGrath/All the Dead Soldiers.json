    "In the chill rains of the early winter I hear something\u2014",
    "A puling anger, a cold wind stiffened by flying bone\u2014",
    "Out of the north ...",
    "and remember, then, what\u2019s up there:",
    "That ghost-bank: home: Amchitka: boot hill ....",
    "They must be very tired, those ghosts; no flesh sustains them",
    "And the bones rust in the rain.",
    "Reluctant to go into the earth",
    "The skulls gleam: wet; the dog-tag forgets the name;",
    "The statistics (wherein they were young) like their crosses, are weathering out,",
    "They must be very tired.",
    "But I see them riding home,",
    "Nightly: crying weak lust and rage: to stand in the dark,",
    "Forlorn in known rooms, unheard near familiar beds:",
    "Where lie the aging women: who were so lovely: once."
