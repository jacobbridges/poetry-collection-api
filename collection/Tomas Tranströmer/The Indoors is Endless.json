    "It\u2019s spring in 1827, Beethoven",
    "hoists his death-mask and sails off.",
    "The grindstones are turning in Europe\u2019s windmills.",
    "The wild geese are flying northwards.",
    "Here is the north, here is Stockholm",
    "swimming palaces and hovels.",
    "The logs in the royal fireplace",
    "collapse from Attention to At Ease.",
    "Peace prevails, vaccine and potatoes,",
    "but the city wells breathe heavily.",
    "Privy barrels in sedan chairs like paschas",
    "are carried by night over the North Bridge.",
    "The cobblestones make them stagger",
    "mamselles loafers gentlemen.",
    "Implacably still, the sign-board",
    "with the smoking blackamoor.",
    "So many islands, so much rowing",
    "with invisible oars against the current!",
    "The channels open up, April May",
    "and sweet honey dribbling June.",
    "The heat reaches islands far out.",
    "The village doors are open, except one.",
    "The snake-clock\u2019s pointer licks the silence.",
    "The rock slopes glow with geology\u2019s patience.",
    "It happened like this, or almost.",
    "It is an obscure family tale",
    "about Erik, done down by a curse",
    "disabled by a bullet through the soul.",
    "He went to town, met an enemy",
    "and sailed home sick and grey.",
    "Keeps to his bed all that summer.",
    "The tools on the wall are in mourning.",
    "He lies awake, hears the woolly flutter",
    "of night moths, his moonlight comrades.",
    "His strength ebbs out, he pushes in vain",
    "against the iron-bound tomorrow.",
    "And the God of the depths cries out of the depths",
    "\u2018Deliver me! Deliver yourself!\u2019",
    "All the surface action turns inwards.",
    "He\u2019s taken apart, put together.",
    "The wind rises and the wild rose bushes",
    "catch on the fleeing light.",
    "The future opens, he looks into",
    "the self-rotating kaleidoscope",
    "sees indistinct fluttering faces",
    "family faces not yet born.",
    "By mistake his gaze strikes me",
    "as I walk around here in Washington",
    "among grandiose houses where only",
    "every second column bears weight.",
    "White buildings in crematorium style",
    "where the dream of the poor turns to ash.",
    "The gentle downward slope gets steeper",
    "and imperceptibly becomes an abyss."
