    "About the Shark, phlegmatical one,",
    "Pale sot of the Maldive sea,",
    "The sleek little pilot-fish, azure and slim,",
    "How alert in attendance be.",
    "From his saw-pit of mouth, from his charnel of maw",
    "They have nothing of harm to dread,",
    "But liquidly glide on his ghastly flank",
    "Or before his Gorgonian head;",
    "Or lurk in the port of serrated teeth",
    "In white triple tiers of glittering gates,",
    "And there find a haven when peril\u2019s abroad,",
    "An asylum in jaws of the Fates!",
    "They are friends; and friendly they guide him to prey,",
    "Yet never partake of the treat\u2014",
    "Eyes and brains to the dotard lethargic and dull,",
    "Pale ravener of horrible meat."
