    "To-night ungather'd let us leave",
    "This laurel, let this holly stand:",
    "We live within the stranger's land,",
    "And strangely falls our Christmas-eve.",
    "Our father's dust is left alone",
    "And silent under other snows:",
    "There in due time the woodbine blows,",
    "The violet comes, but we are gone.",
    "No more shall wayward grief abuse",
    "The genial hour with mask and mime;",
    "For change of place, like growth of time,",
    "Has broke the bond of dying use.",
    "Let cares that petty shadows cast,",
    "By which our lives are chiefly proved,",
    "A little spare the night I loved,",
    "And hold it solemn to the past.",
    "But let no footstep beat the floor,",
    "Nor bowl of wassail mantle warm;",
    "For who would keep an ancient form",
    "Thro' which the spirit breathes no more?",
    "Be neither song, nor game, nor feast;",
    "Nor harp be touch'd, nor flute be blown;",
    "No dance, no motion, save alone",
    "What lightens in the lucid east",
    "Of rising worlds by yonder wood.",
    "Long sleeps the summer in the seed;",
    "Run out your measured arcs, and lead",
    "The closing cycle rich in good."
