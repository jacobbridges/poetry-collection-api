    "O sweet and bitter in a breath,",

    "\"The stars,\" she whispers, \"blindly run;",
    "A web is wov'n across the sky;",
    "From out waste places comes a cry,",
    "And murmurs from the dying sun:",
    "\"And all the phantom, Nature, standsi",
    "With all the music in her tone,",
    "A hollow echo of my own,i",
    "A hollow form with empty hands.\"",
    "And shall I take a thing so blind,",
    "Embrace her as my natural good;",
    "Or crush her, like a vice of blood,",
    "Upon the threshold of the mind?"
