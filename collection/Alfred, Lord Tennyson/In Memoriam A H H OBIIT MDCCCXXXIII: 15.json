    "To-night the winds begin to rise",
    "And roar from yonder dropping day:",
    "The last red leaf is whirl'd away,",
    "The rooks are blown about the skies;",
    "The forest crack'd, the waters curl'd,",
    "The cattle huddled on the lea;",
    "And wildly dash'd on tower and tree",
    "The sunbeam strikes along the world:",
    "And but for fancies, which aver",
    "That all thy motions gently pass",
    "Athwart a plane of molten glass,",
    "I scarce could brook the strain and stir",
    "That makes the barren branches loud;",
    "And but for fear it is not so,",
    "The wild unrest that lives in woe",
    "Would dote and pore on yonder cloud",
    "That rises upward always higher,",
    "And onward drags a labouring breast,",
    "And topples round the dreary west,",
    "A looming bastion fringed with fire."
