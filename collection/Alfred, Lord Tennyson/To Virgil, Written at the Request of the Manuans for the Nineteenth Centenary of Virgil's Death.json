    "All the chosen coin of fancy",
    "flashing out from many a golden phrase;",

    "at the doubtful doom of human kind;",
    "Light among the vanish'd ages;",
    "star that gildest yet this phantom shore;",
    "Golden branch amid the shadows,",
    "kings and realms that pass to rise no more;",
    "Now thy Forum roars no longer,",
    "fallen every purple C\u00e6sar's dome\u0097",
    "Tho' thine ocean-roll of rhythm",
    "sound forever of Imperial Rome\u0097",
    "Now the Rome of slaves hath perish'd,",
    "and the Rome of freemen holds her place,",
    "I, from out the Northern Island",
    "sunder'd once from all the human race,",
    "I salute thee, Mantovano,",
    "I that loved thee since my day began,",
    "Wielder of the stateliest measure",
    "ever moulded by the lips of man."
