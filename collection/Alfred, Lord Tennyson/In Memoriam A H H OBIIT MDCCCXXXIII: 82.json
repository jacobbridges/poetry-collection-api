    "I wage not any feud with Death",
    "For changes wrought on form and face;",
    "No lower life that earth's embrace",
    "May breed with him, can fright my faith.",
    "Eternal process moving on,",
    "From state to state the spirit walks;",
    "And these are but the shatter'd stalks,",
    "Or ruin'd chrysalis of one.",
    "Nor blame I Death, because he bare",
    "The use of virtue out of earth:",
    "I know transplanted human worth",
    "Will bloom to profit, otherwhere.",
    "For this alone on Death I wreak",
    "The wrath that garners in my heart;",
    "He put our lives so far apart",
    "We cannot hear each other speak."
