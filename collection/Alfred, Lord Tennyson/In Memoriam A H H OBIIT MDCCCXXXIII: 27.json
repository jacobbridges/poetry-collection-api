    "I envy not in any moods",
    "The captive void of noble rage,",
    "The linnet born within the cage,",
    "That never knew the summer woods:",
    "I envy not the beast that takes",
    "His license in the field of time,",
    "Unfetter'd by the sense of crime,",
    "To whom a conscience never wakes;",
    "Nor, what may count itself as blest,",
    "The heart that never plighted troth",
    "But stagnates in the weeds of sloth;",
    "Nor any want-begotten rest.",
    "I hold it true, whate'er befall;",
    "I feel it, when I sorrow most;",
    "'Tis better to have loved and lost",
    "Than never to have loved at all."
