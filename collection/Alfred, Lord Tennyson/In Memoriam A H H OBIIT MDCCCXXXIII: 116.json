    "Is it, then, regret for buried time",
    "That keenlier in sweet April wakes,",
    "And meets the year, and gives and takes",
    "The colours of the crescent prime?",
    "Not all: the songs, the stirring air,",
    "The life re-orient out of dust,",
    "Cry thro' the sense to hearten trust",
    "In that which made the world so fair.",
    "Not all regret: the face will shine",
    "Upon me, while I muse alone;",
    "And that dear voice, I once have known,",
    "Still speak to me of me and mine:",
    "Yet less of sorrow lives in me",
    "For days of happy commune dead;",
    "Less yearning for the friendship fled,",
    "Than some strong bond which is to be."
