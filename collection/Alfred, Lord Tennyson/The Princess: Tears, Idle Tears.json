    "Tears, idle tears, I know not what they mean,",
    "Tears from the depth of some divine despair",
    "Rise in the heart, and gather to the eyes,",
    "In looking on the happy Autumn-fields,",
    "And thinking of the days that are no more.",
    "Fresh as the first beam glittering on a sail,",
    "That brings our friends up from the underworld,",
    "Sad as the last which reddens over one",
    "That sinks with all we love below the verge;",
    "So sad, so fresh, the days that are no more.",
    "Ah, sad and strange as in dark summer dawns",
    "The earliest pipe of half-awaken'd birds",
    "To dying ears, when unto dying eyes",
    "The casement slowly grows a glimmering square;",
    "So sad, so strange, the days that are no more.",
    "Dear as remember'd kisses after death,",
    "And sweet as those by hopeless fancy feign'd",
    "On lips that are for others; deep as love,",
    "Deep as first love, and wild with all regret;",
    "O Death in Life, the days that are no more!"
