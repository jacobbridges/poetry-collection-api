    "When the breeze of a joyful dawn blew free",
    "In the silken sail of infancy,",
    "The tide of time flow'd back with me,",
    "The forward-flowing tide of time;",
    "And many a sheeny summer-morn,",
    "Adown the Tigris I was borne,",
    "By Bagdat's shrines of fretted gold,",
    "High-walled gardens green and old;",
    "True Mussulman was I and sworn,",
    "For it was in the golden prime",
    "Of good Haroun Alraschid.",
    "Anight my shallop, rustling thro'",
    "The low and bloomed foliage, drove",
    "The fragrant, glistening deeps, and clove",
    "The citron-shadows in the blue:",
    "By garden porches on the brim,",
    "The costly doors flung open wide,",
    "Gold glittering thro' lamplight dim,",
    "And broider'd sofas on each side:",
    "In sooth it was a goodly time,",
    "For it was in the golden prime",
    "Of good Haroun Alraschid.",
    "Often, where clear-stemm'd platans guard",
    "The outlet, did I turn away",
    "The boat-head down a broad canal",
    "From the main river sluiced, where all",
    "The sloping of the moon-lit sward",
    "Was damask-work, and deep inlay",
    "Of braided blooms unmown, which crept",
    "Adown to where the water slept.",
    "A goodly place, a goodly time,",
    "For it was in the golden prime",
    "Of good Haroun Alraschid.",
    "A motion from the river won",
    "Ridged the smooth level, bearing on",
    "My shallop thro' the star-strown calm,",
    "Until another night in night",
    "I enter'd, from the clearer light,",
    "Imbower'd vaults of pillar'd palm,",
    "Imprisoning sweets, which, as they clomb",
    "Heavenward, were stay'd beneath the dome",
    "Of hollow boughs.\u2014A goodly time,",
    "For it was in the golden prime",
    "Of good Haroun Alraschid.",
    "Still onward; and the clear canal",
    "Is rounded to as clear a lake.",
    "From the green rivage many a fall",
    "Of diamond rillets musical,",
    "Thro' little crystal arches low",
    "Down from the central fountain's flow",
    "Fall'n silver-chiming, seem'd to shake",
    "The sparkling flints beneath the prow.",
    "A goodly place, a goodly time,",
    "For it was in the golden prime",
    "Of good Haroun Alraschid.",
    "Above thro' many a bowery turn",
    "A walk with vary-colour'd shells",
    "Wander'd engrain'd. On either side",
    "All round about the fragrant marge",
    "From fluted vase, and brazen urn",
    "In order, eastern flowers large,",
    "Some dropping low their crimson bells",
    "Half-closed, and others studded wide",
    "With disks and tiars, fed the time",
    "With odour in the golden prime",
    "Of good Haroun Alraschid.",
    "Far off, and where the lemon-grove",
    "In closest coverture upsprung,",
    "The living airs of middle night",
    "Died round the bulbul as he sung;",
    "Not he: but something which possess'd",
    "The darkness of the world, delight,",
    "Life, anguish, death, immortal love,",
    "Ceasing not, mingled, unrepress'd,",
    "Apart from place, withholding time,",
    "But flattering the golden prime",
    "Of good Haroun Alraschid.",
    "Black the garden-bowers and grots",
    "Slumber'd: the solemn palms were ranged",
    "Above, unwoo'd of summer wind:",
    "A sudden splendour from behind",
    "Flush'd all the leaves with rich gold-green,",
    "And, flowing rapidly between",
    "Their interspaces, counterchanged",
    "The level lake with diamond-plots",
    "Of dark and bright. A lovely time,",
    "For it was in the golden prime",
    "Of good Haroun Alraschid.",
    "Dark-blue the deep sphere overhead,",
    "Distinct with vivid stars inlaid,",
    "Grew darker from that under-flame:",
    "So, leaping lightly from the boat,",
    "With silver anchor left afloat,",
    "In marvel whence that glory came",
    "Upon me, as in sleep I sank",
    "In cool soft turf upon the bank,",
    "Entranced with that place and time,",
    "So worthy of the golden prime",
    "Of good Haroun Alraschid.",
    "Thence thro' the garden I was drawn\u2014",
    "A realm of pleasance, many a mound,",
    "And many a shadow-chequer'd lawn",
    "Full of the city's stilly sound,",
    "And deep myrrh-thickets blowing round",
    "The stately cedar, tamarisks,",
    "Thick rosaries of scented thorn,",
    "Tall orient shrubs, and obelisks",
    "Graven with emblems of the time,",
    "In honour of the golden prime",
    "Of good Haroun Alraschid.",
    "With dazed vision unawares",
    "From the long alley's latticed shade",
    "Emerged, I came upon the great",
    "Pavilion of the Caliphat.",
    "Right to the carven cedarn doors,",
    "Flung inward over spangled floors,",
    "Broad-based flights of marble stairs",
    "Ran up with golden balustrade,",
    "After the fashion of the time,",
    "And humour of the golden prime",
    "Of good Haroun Alraschid.",
    "The fourscore windows all alight",
    "As with the quintessence of flame,",
    "A million tapers flaring bright",
    "From twisted silvers look'd to shame",
    "The hollow-vaulted dark, and stream'd",
    "Upon the mooned domes aloof",
    "In inmost Bagdat, till there seem'd",
    "Hundreds of crescents on the roof",
    "Of night new-risen, that marvellous time,",
    "To celebrate the golden prime",
    "Of good Haroun Alraschid.",
    "Then stole I up, and trancedly",
    "Gazed on the Persian girl alone,",
    "Serene with argent-lidded eyes",
    "Amorous, and lashes like to rays",
    "Of darkness, and a brow of pearl",
    "Tressed with redolent ebony,",
    "In many a dark delicious curl,",
    "Flowing beneath her rose-hued zone;",
    "The sweetest lady of the time,",
    "Well worthy of the golden prime",
    "Of good Haroun Alraschid.",
    "Six columns, three on either side,",
    "Pure silver, underpropt a rich",
    "Throne of the massive ore, from which",
    "Down-droop'd, in many a floating fold,",
    "Engarlanded and diaper'd",
    "With inwrought flowers, a cloth of gold.",
    "Thereon, his deep eye laughter-stirr'd",
    "With merriment of kingly pride,",
    "Sole star of all that place and time,",
    "I saw him\u2014in his golden prime,",
    "THE GOOD HAROUN ALRASCHID!"
