    "Calm is the morn without a sound,",
    "Calm as to suit a calmer grief,",
    "And only thro' the faded leaf",
    "The chestnut pattering to the ground:",
    "Calm and deep peace on this high wold,",
    "And on these dews that drench the furze.",
    "And all the silvery gossamers",
    "That twinkle into green and gold:",
    "Calm and still light on yon great plain",
    "That sweeps with all its autumn bowers,",
    "And crowded farms and lessening towers,",
    "To mingle with the bounding main:",
    "Calm and deep peace in this wide air,",
    "These leaves that redden to the fall;",
    "And in my heart, if calm at all,",
    "If any calm, a calm despair:",
    "Calm on the seas, and silver sleep,",
    "And waves that sway themselves in rest,",
    "And dead calm in that noble breast",
    "Which heaves but with the heaving deep."
