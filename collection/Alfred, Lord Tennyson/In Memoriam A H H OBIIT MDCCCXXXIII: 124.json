    "That which we dare invoke to bless;",
    "Our dearest faith; our ghastliest doubt;",
    "He, They, One, All; within, without;",
    "The Power in darkness whom we guess;",
    "I found Him not in world or sun,",
    "Or eagle's wing, or insect's eye;",
    "Nor thro' the questions men may try,",
    "The petty cobwebs we have spun:",
    "If e'er when faith had fall'n asleep,",
    "I heard a voice, \"Believe no more,\"",
    "And heard an ever-breaking shore",
    "That tumbled in the Godless deep,",
    "A warmth within the breast would melt",
    "The freezing reason's colder part,",
    "And like a man in wrath the heart",
    "Stood up and answer'd, \"I have felt.\"",
    "No, like a child in doubt and fear:",
    "But that blind clamour made me wise;",
    "Then was I as a child that cries,",
    "But crying, knows his father near;",
    "And what I am beheld again",
    "What is, and no man understands;",
    "And out of darkness came the hands",
    "That reach thro' nature, moulding men."
