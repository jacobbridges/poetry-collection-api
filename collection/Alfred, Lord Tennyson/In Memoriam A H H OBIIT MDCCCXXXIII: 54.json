    "Oh, yet we trust that somehow good",
    "Will be the final end of ill,",
    "To pangs of nature, sins of will,",
    "Defects of doubt, and taints of blood;",
    "That nothing walks with aimless feet;",
    "That not one life shall be destroy'd,",
    "Or cast as rubbish to the void,",
    "When God hath made the pile complete;",
    "That not a worm is cloven in vain;",
    "That not a moth with vain desire",
    "Is shrivell'd in a fruitless fire,",
    "Or but subserves another's gain.",
    "Behold, we know not anything;",
    "I can but trust that good shall fall",
    "At last\u2014far off\u2014at last, to all,",
    "And every winter change to spring.",
    "So runs my dream: but what am I?",
    "An infant crying in the night:",
    "An infant crying for the light:",
    "And with no language but a cry."
