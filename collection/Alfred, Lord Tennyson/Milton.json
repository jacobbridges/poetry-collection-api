    "O mighty-mouth'd inventor of harmonies,",
    "O skill'd to sing of Time or Eternity,",
    "God-gifted organ-voice of England,",
    "Milton, a name to resound for ages;",
    "Whose Titan angels, Gabriel, Abdiel,",
    "Starr'd from Jehovah's gorgeous armouries,",
    "Tower, as the deep-domed empyrean",
    "Rings to the roar of an angel onset\u0097",
    "Me rather all that bowery loneliness,",
    "The brooks of Eden mazily murmuring,",
    "And bloom profuse and cedar arches",
    "Charm, as a wanderer out in ocean,",
    "Where some refulgent sunset of India",
    "Streams o'er a rich ambrosial ocean isle,",
    "And crimson-hued the stately palm-woods",
    "Whisper in odorous heights of even."
