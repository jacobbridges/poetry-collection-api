    "Break, break, break,",

    "And I would that my tongue could utter",

    "O, well for the fisherman's boy,",
    "That he shouts with his sister at play!",
    "O, well for the sailor lad,",
    "That he sings in his boat on the bay!",
    "And the stately ships go on",
    "To their haven under the hill;",
    "But O for the touch of a vanish'd hand,",
    "And the sound of a voice that is still!",
    "Break, break, break",
    "At the foot of thy crags, O Sea!",
    "But the tender grace of a day that is dead",
    "Will never come back to me."
