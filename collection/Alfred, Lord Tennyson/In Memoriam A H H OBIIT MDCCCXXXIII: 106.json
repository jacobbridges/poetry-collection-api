    "Ring out, wild bells, to the wild sky,",
    "The flying cloud, the frosty light:",
    "The year is dying in the night;",
    "Ring out, wild bells, and let him die.",
    "Ring out the old, ring in the new,",
    "Ring, happy bells, across the snow:",
    "The year is going, let him go;",
    "Ring out the false, ring in the true.",
    "Ring out the grief that saps the mind",
    "For those that here we see no more;",
    "Ring out the feud of rich and poor,",
    "Ring in redress to all mankind.",
    "Ring out a slowly dying cause,",
    "And ancient forms of party strife;",
    "Ring in the nobler modes of life,",
    "With sweeter manners, purer laws.",
    "Ring out the want, the care, the sin,",
    "The faithless coldness of the times;",
    "Ring out, ring out my mournful rhymes",
    "But ring the fuller minstrel in.",
    "Ring out false pride in place and blood,",
    "The civic slander and the spite;",
    "Ring in the love of truth and right,",
    "Ring in the common love of good.",
    "Ring out old shapes of foul disease;",
    "Ring out the narrowing lust of gold;",
    "Ring out the thousand wars of old,",
    "Ring in the thousand years of peace.",
    "Ring in the valiant man and free,",
    "The larger heart, the kindlier hand;",
    "Ring out the darkness of the land,",
    "Ring in the Christ that is to be."
