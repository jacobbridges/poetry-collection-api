    "When on my bed the moonlight falls,",
    "I know that in thy place of rest",
    "By that broad water of the west,",
    "There comes a glory on the walls:",
    "Thy marble bright in dark appears,",
    "As slowly steals a silver flame",
    "Along the letters of thy name,",
    "And o'er the number of thy years.",
    "The mystic glory swims away;",
    "From off my bed the moonlight dies;",
    "And closing eaves of wearied eyes",
    "I sleep till dusk is dipt in gray:",
    "And then I know the mist is drawn",
    "A lucid veil from coast to coast,",
    "And in the dark church like a ghost",
    "Thy tablet glimmers to the dawn."
