    "Turn, Fortune, turn thy wheel, and lower the proud;",
    "Turn thy wild wheel thro' sunshine, storm, and cloud;",

    "Turn, Fortune, turn thy wheel with smile or frown;",
    "With that wild wheel we go not up or down;",
    "Our hoard is little, but our hearts are great.",
    "Smile and we smile, the lords of many lands;",
    "Frown and we smile, the lords of our own hands;",
    "For man is man and master of his fate.",
    "Turn, turn thy wheel above the staring crowd;",
    "Thy wheel and thou are shadows in the cloud;",
    "Thy wheel and thee we neither love nor hate."
