    "Light, so low upon earth,",
    "You send a flash to the sun.",
    "Here is the golden close of love,",
    "All my wooing is done.",
    "Oh, all the woods and the meadows,",
    "Woods, where we hid from the wet,",
    "Stiles where we stayed to be kind,",
    "Meadows in which we met!",
    "Light, so low in the vale",
    "You flash and lighten afar,",
    "For this is the golden morning of love,",
    "And you are his morning star.",
    "Flash, I am coming, I come,",
    "By meadow and stile and wood,",
    "Oh, lighten into my eyes and my heart,",
    "Into my heart and my blood!",
    "Heart, are you great enough",
    "For a love that never tires?",
    "O heart, are you great enough for love?",
    "I have heard of thorns and briers.",
    "Over the thorns and briers,",
    "Over the meadows and stiles,",
    "Over the world to the end of it",
    "Flash of a million miles."
