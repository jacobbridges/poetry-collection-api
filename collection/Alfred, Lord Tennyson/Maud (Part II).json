    "O that 'twere possible",
    "After long grief and pain",
    "To find the arms of my true love",
    "Round me once again!",
    "When I was wont to meet her",
    "In the silent woody places",
    "By the home that gave me birth,",
    "We stood tranced in long embraces",
    "Mixt with kisses sweeter sweeter",
    "Than anything on earth.",
    "A shadow flits before me,",
    "Not thou, but like to thee:",
    "Ah Christ, that it were possible",
    "For one short hour to see",
    "The souls we loved, that they might tell us",
    "What and where they be.",
    "It leads me forth at evening,",
    "It lightly winds and steals",
    "In a cold white robe before me,",
    "When all my spirit reels",
    "At the shouts, the leagues of lights,",
    "And the roaring of the wheels.",
    "Half the night I waste in sighs,",
    "Half in dreams I sorrow after",
    "The delight of early skies;",
    "In a wakeful doze I sorrow",
    "For the hand, the lips, the eyes,",
    "For the meeting of the morrow,",
    "The delight of happy laughter,",
    "The delight of low replies.",
    "'Tis a morning pure and sweet,",
    "And a dewy splendour falls",
    "On the little flower that clings",
    "To the turrets and the walls;",
    "'Tis a morning pure and sweet,",
    "And the light and shadow fleet;",
    "She is walking in the meadow,",
    "And the woodland echo rings;",
    "In a moment we shall meet;",
    "She is singing in the meadow,",
    "And the rivulet at her feet",
    "Ripples on in light and shadow",
    "To the ballad that she sings.",
    "So I hear her sing as of old,",
    "My bird with the shining head,",
    "My own dove with the tender eye?",
    "But there rings on a sudden a passionate cry,",
    "There is some one dying or dead,",
    "And a sullen thunder is roll'd;",
    "For a tumult shakes the city,",
    "And I wake, my dream is fled;",
    "In the shuddering dawn, behold,",
    "Without knowledge, without pity,",
    "By the curtains of my bed",
    "That abiding phantom cold.",
    "Get thee hence, nor come again,",
    "Mix not memory with doubt,",
    "Pass, thou deathlike type of pain,",
    "Pass and cease to move about!",
    "'Tis the blot upon the brain",
    "That",
    "show itself without.",
    "Then I rise, the eave-drops fall,",
    "And the yellow vapours choke",
    "The great city sounding wide;",
    "The day comes, a dull red ball",
    "Wrapt in drifts of lurid smoke",
    "On the misty river-tide.",
    "Thro' the hubbub of the market",
    "I steal, a wasted frame;",
    "It crosses here, it crosses there,",
    "Thro' all that crowd confused and loud,",
    "The shadow still the same;",
    "And on my heavy eyelids",
    "My anguish hangs like shame.",
    "Alas for her that met me,",
    "That heard me softly call,",
    "Came glimmering thro' the laurels",
    "At the quiet evenfall,",
    "In the garden by the turrets",
    "Of the old manorial hall.",
    "Would the happy spirit descend",
    "From the realms of light and song,",
    "In the chamber or the street,",
    "As she looks among the blest,",
    "Should I fear to greet my friend",
    "Or to say \"Forgive the wrong,\"",
    "Or to ask her, \"Take me, sweet,",
    "To the regions of thy rest\"?",
    "But the broad light glares and beats,",
    "And the shadow flits and fleets",
    "And will not let me be;",
    "And I loathe the squares and streets,",
    "And the faces that one meets,",
    "Hearts with no love for me:",
    "Always I long to creep",
    "Into some still cavern deep,",
    "There to weep, and weep, and weep",
    "My whole soul out to thee."
