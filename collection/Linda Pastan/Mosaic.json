    "1. THE SACRIFICE",
    "On this tile",
    "the knife",
    "like a sickle-moon hangs",
    "in the painted air",
    "as if it had learned a dance",
    "of its own,",
    "the way the boy has",
    "among the vivid",
    "breakable flowers,",
    "the way Abraham has",
    "among the boulders,",
    "his two feet heavy",
    "as stones.",
    "2. NEAR SINAI",
    "God's hand here",
    "is the size of a tiny cloud,",
    "and the wordless tablets",
    "he holds out",
    "curve like the temple doors.",
    "Moses, reaching up",
    "must see on their empty surface",
    "laws chiseled in his mind",
    "by the persistent wind",
    "of the desert, by wind",
    "in the bulrushes.",
    "3. THE FLIGHT INTO EGYPT",
    "We know by the halos",
    "that circle these heads",
    "like rings around planets",
    "that the small donkey",
    "has carried his burden",
    "away from the thunder",
    "of the Old Testament",
    "into the lightning",
    "of the New.",
    "4. AT THE ARMENIAN TILE SHOP",
    "Under the bright glazes",
    "Esau watches Jacob,",
    "Cain watches Abel.",
    "With the same heavy eyes",
    "the tilemaker's Arab assistant",
    "watches me,",
    "all of us wondering",
    "why for every pair",
    "there is just one",
    "blessing."
