    "1.",
    "Imagine waking",
    "to a scene of snow so new",
    "not even memories",
    "of other snow",
    "can mar its silken",
    "surface. What other innocence",
    "is quite like this,",
    "and who can blame me",
    "for refusing",
    "to violate such whiteness",
    "with the booted cruelty",
    "of tracks?",
    "2.",
    "Though I cannot leave this house,",
    "I have memorized the view",
    "from every window\u2014",
    "23 framed landscapes, containing",
    "each nuance of weather and light.",
    "And I know the measure",
    "of every room, not as a prisoner",
    "pacing a cell",
    "but as the embryo knows",
    "the walls of the womb, free",
    "to swim as its body tells it, to nudge",
    "the softly fleshed walls,",
    "dreading only the moment",
    "of contraction when it will be forced",
    "into the gaudy world.",
    "3.",
    "Sometimes I travel as far",
    "as the last stone",
    "of the path, but",
    "every step,",
    "as in the children's story,",
    "pricks that tender place",
    "on the bottom of the foot,",
    "and like an ebbing tide with all",
    "the obsession of the moon behind it,",
    "I am dragged back.",
    "4.",
    "I have noticed in windy fall",
    "how leaves are torn from the trees,",
    "each leaf waving goodbye to the oak",
    "or the poplar that housed it;",
    "how the moon, pinned",
    "to the very center of the window,",
    "is like a moth wanting only to break in.",
    "What I mean is this house",
    "follows all the laws of lintel and ridgepole,",
    "obeys the commandments of broom",
    "and of needle, custom and grace.",
    "It is not fear that holds me here but passion",
    "and the uncrossable moat of moonlight",
    "outside the bolted doors."
