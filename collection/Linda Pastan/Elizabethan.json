    "Her sex sent her mother",
    "to the tower,",
    "made her father profligate",
    "with arrogant desires,",
    "but she was made of flint",
    "and backbone.",
    "Think of a young girl",
    "in a blue velvet bodice,",
    "a white collar and lace,",
    "the very prototype",
    "of virginal.",
    "Think of a woman, her court",
    "enlivened by suitors and lovers",
    "in doublets, in brocaded cloaks,",
    "despite suspicions of their motives",
    "staining the sheets,",
    "the way cups of spicy,",
    "flowery mead were sipped",
    "despite the possibility",
    "of poison.",
    "Even the crown of the sun",
    "must go down each night.",
    "Could she have stood at the prow",
    "of a ship in that great Armada she ordered,",
    "instead of at a window, waiting",
    "for urgent results?",
    "Could she have guessed that the words",
    "of a man she inspired, carved",
    "into the marble of ages,",
    "had a muscular beauty",
    "more than equal",
    "to her own worldly triumphs?",
    "Daughter, Queen, Ruler",
    "of roiling seas, of meandering",
    "rivers and meadows,",
    "of armies of soldiers, their swords",
    "and armor glittering",
    "like planets to her sun.",
    "Namesake to an age.",
    "And Poet?",
    "When she turned",
    "to the empty parchment",
    "(or once to a windowpane,",
    "a diamond for quill)",
    "everything",
    "must have gone quiet.",
    "Even a queen is naked",
    "before the naked page, awaiting",
    "not the generous spoils owed to a victor",
    "but the gifts freely given",
    "of a besotted muse."
