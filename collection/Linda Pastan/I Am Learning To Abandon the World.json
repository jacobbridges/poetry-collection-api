    "I am learning to abandon the world",
    "before it can abandon me.",
    "Already I have given up the moon",
    "and snow, closing my shades",
    "against the claims of white.",
    "And the world has taken",
    "my father, my friends.",
    "I have given up melodic lines of hills,",
    "moving to a flat, tuneless landscape.",
    "And every night I give my body up",
    "limb by limb, working upwards",
    "across bone, towards the heart.",
    "But morning comes with small",
    "reprieves of coffee and birdsong.",
    "A tree outside the window",
    "which was simply shadow moments ago",
    "takes back its branches twig",
    "by leafy twig.",
    "And as I take my body back",
    "the sun lays its warm muzzle on my lap",
    "as if to make amends."
