    "I call and hear your voice",
    "on the answering machine",
    "weeks after your death,",
    "a fledgling ghost still longing",
    "for human messages.",
    "Shall I leave one, telling",
    "how the fabric of our lives",
    "has been ripped before",
    "but that this sudden tear will not",
    "be mended soon or easily?",
    "In your emptying house, others",
    "roll up rugs, pack books,",
    "drink coffee at your antique table,",
    "and listen to messages left",
    "on a machine haunted",
    "by the timbre of your voice,",
    "more palpable than photographs",
    "or fingerprints. On this first day",
    "of this first fall without you,",
    "ashamed and resisting",
    "but compelled, I dial again",
    "the number I know by heart,",
    "thankful in a diminished world",
    "for the accidental mercy of machines,",
    "then listen and hang up."
