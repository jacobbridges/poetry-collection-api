    "With the seal of science",

    "on your forehead,",
    "like the old Good Housekeeping",
    "Seal of Approval,",
    "I believe what you tell me",
    "about cells and molecules,",
    "though I can't see them.",
    "And though the language you speak",
    "is full of numbers and symbols",
    "I'll never understand;",
    "though your tie is askew",
    "and your hair unruly, still I believe",
    "what you say about the size of the universe,",
    "which is either expanding or contracting,",
    "I've forgotten which already.",
    "So if tomorrow you tell me",
    "you made a small miscalculation,",
    "that God indeed created the world",
    "in 6 short days, then rested on the 7th,",
    "that it was Eve who landed us",
    "in all this trouble, I would believe you.",
    "I would believe you",
    "as I've always done before."
