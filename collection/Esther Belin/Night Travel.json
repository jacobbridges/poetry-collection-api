    "I.",

    "Now for over forty years.",
    "I drive to L.A. in the darkness of the day",
    "on the road before CHP",
    "one with the dark",
    "driving my black truck",
    "invisible on my journey home.",
    "The dark roads take me back to my childhood",
    "riding in the camper of daddy\u2019s truck headed home.",
    "My brother, sister and I would be put to sleep in the camper",
    "and sometime in the darkness of the day",
    "daddy would clime into the cab with mom carrying a thermos full of coffee and some Pendleton blankets",
    "And they would pray",
    "before daddy started the truck",
    "for journey mercies.",
    "Often I\u2019d rise from my lullaby sleep and stare into the darkness of the road",
    "the long darkness empty of cars",
    "Glowy from daddy\u2019s headlights and lonesome from Hank Williams\u2019 deep and twangy voice singing of cold nights and cheatin\u2019 hearts.",
    "About an hour from Flagstaff",
    "the sun would greet us",
    "and the harsh light would break the darkness",
    "and we\u2019d be hungry from travel and for being almost home.",
    "II.",
    "I know the darkness of the roads",
    "endless into the glowy path before me",
    "lit by the moon high above and the heat rising from my truck\u2019s engine.",
    "The humming from tires whisper mile after mile",
    "endless alongside roadside of fields shadowy from glow.",
    "I know the darkness of the roads",
    "It swims through my veins",
    "dark like my skin",
    "and silenced like a battered wife.",
    "I know the darkness of the roads",
    "It floods my liver",
    "pollutes my breath",
    "yet I still witness the white dawning."
