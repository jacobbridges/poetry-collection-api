    "My sister and I went out to them with sugar",
    "cubes and bridled their heads when they bent down",
    "to eat from our palms. We led them over",
    "to the long white fence on which we climbed",
    "to the topmost rail, then threw our legs",
    "across their backs, clutching the reins to steady",
    "ourselves against their girth, steering them out",
    "into the hills until we were lost, or thought",
    "we were, only to find ourselves at Judith",
    "Creek or Holcomb Rock where we\u2019d turn back",
    "in the early dark, gripping their manes, crouching",
    "low, galloping hard on the high soft",
    "road across the fields to the open barn."
