    "It\u2019s not paradise I\u2019m looking for",
    "but the naming I hardly gave a thought to.",
    "Call it the gift I carried in my loneliness",
    "among the animals before I started",
    "listening to the news. Call it the hint",
    "I had about the knowledge that would explode.",
    "In the meantime, which is real time",
    "plus the past, you\u2019re swishing your skirt",
    "and speaking French, which is more",
    "than I can take, which I marvel at",
    "like a boy from the most distant seat",
    "in the Kronos Dome, where I am one",
    "of so many now I see the point",
    "of falling off. There\u2019s not enough seats",
    "for us all to attend the eschaton.",
    "This ecstasy that plants beauty",
    "on my tongue, so that if it were",
    "a wing, I\u2019d be flying with the quickness",
    "of a hummingbird and grace of a heron,",
    "is so much mercy in light of the darkness",
    "that comes. Who would say consolation?",
    "Who would say dross? Not that anyone",
    "would blame them. All night I hear",
    "so many echoes in the forest I\u2019m tempted",
    "to look back, to save myself in hindsight,",
    "where all I see is the absence of me.",
    "Where all I hear is your voice,",
    "which couldn\u2019t be more strange.",
    "How to go on walking hand in hand",
    "without our bodies on the path",
    "we made for our feet, talking, talking?"
