    "Each could picture probably",
    "with great care his brother drawing",
    "the corded string of a watered silk bag",
    "and mumbling to Basho above the keepsake",
    "now your eyebrows look a little white too",
    "but all have turned instead to watch this child",
    "a girl my daughter Simone",
    "an astute migrant",
    "skimming the stream of days",
    "toted wherever she wants",
    "to eat the dirt of inattentive towns",
    "to arm wrestle as with",
    "the blind & steal a stoic",
    "shipping him home\u2014",
    "all have turned & run to her because",
    "she has a spider on her neck she has",
    "seen herself",
    "though blindfolded by a cloud",
    "the sun is a yellowjacket",
    "drowning in a cup of coffee she carries",
    "a spider in her hair",
    "blond & blonder dear river."
