    "Written on clapboard or asbestos siding, the cartoony",
    "spray-paint signatures of Apollo and Zeus,",
    "two home boys out bombing last night in thick fog.",
    "Fog near the shade of pearls. Except they didn\u2019t see the mist",
    "that way, glad for their thin leather gloves.",
    "Wind raw at the wide avenue, so they cut",
    "from there to here.",
    "Even if this is in the past",
    "tense, tense of the totally chilled-out,",
    "even if they argued here over Krylon blue or candy-apple red,",
    "that doesn\u2019t mean they knocked-off and streaked home then.",
    "And if I saw fog the shade of pearls",
    "it doesn\u2019t mean my heart in its own corrosive and healing fog",
    "can\u2019t tug on thin leather gloves and stand",
    "in front of a wall, pissing off the Fates",
    "and whoever else owns that wall. Whoever owns it",
    "means less than the dry, fallen leaves of eucalyptus",
    "blown crackling over tar and concrete",
    "and sounding, when you shut your eyes, like every tree",
    "bursting into leaf for the first time, speeded-up",
    "like the first minute of the world."
