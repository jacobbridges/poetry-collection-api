    "Now that everything seems so persuasive",
    "you will go on changing as always",
    "it has always been the case with you",
    "whether you knew it or not ever since",
    "that morning in the swamp that Sunday",
    "a sunless windy morning when",
    "right in front of you a fat hive dropped",
    "unbidden out of a blackened tree",
    "a tupelo and where it fell the water",
    "was shallow eighteen inches at most",
    "but in it one hundred & fifty-six wasps",
    "drowned so no you are not",
    "finished your apprenticeship is not yet over",
    "you have fallen in love inadvertently you",
    "are the bride-to-be and now having",
    "dressed yourself in the gown for practice",
    "you must stand before a mirror",
    "in the upper right-hand corner of",
    "which all of a sudden a courtroom",
    "will appear the litigants judge & jury",
    "suspended there in midair a news",
    "bulletin the reporter's face reflected",
    "from a portable television far across",
    "the room the sound turned down",
    "the litigants looking tense or bored",
    "the whole crew of them a little",
    "self-conscious like characters who have",
    "just recently been conjured though somewhat",
    "incompletely by a staff of studio writers",
    "in Century City California",
    "In a field off a Vermont road later",
    "this week you'll listen to a car ticking",
    "as it cools the sound of the engine",
    "blending with the cicadas in tall bluegrass",
    "floating past as in a dream then",
    "you will finger the veil & lift",
    "your mother & father long ago set aside",
    "in a folder for silences & song",
    "you'll waken almost immediately",
    "reborn you will have lifted the veil",
    "though of course sooner or later farther",
    "down the line that stranger the one",
    "with whom you spend so much time",
    "in your mind talking he will reveal",
    "he is your brother and what",
    "will you have to say to him then when",
    "as he must he asks if you had",
    "allowed yourself to lead a happy life",
    "in spite of the fact your parents",
    "had not what is it you will tell him",
    "what answer can you give?"
