    "\u2019Tis merry to hear, at evening time,",
    "By the blazing hearth the sleigh-bells chime;",
    "To know the bounding steeds bring near",
    "The loved one to our bosoms dear.",
    "Ah, lightly we spring the fire to raise,",
    "Till the rafters glow with the ruddy blaze;",
    "Those merry sleigh-bells, our hearts keep time",
    "Responsive to their fairy chime.",
    "Ding-dong, ding-dong, o\u2019er vale and hill,",
    "Their welcome notes are trembling still.",
    "\u2019Tis he, and blithely the gay bells sound,",
    "As his sleigh glides over the frozen ground;",
    "Hark! He has pass\u2019d the dark pine wood,",
    "He crosses now the ice-bound flood,",
    "And hails the light at the open door",
    "That tells his toilsome journey\u2019s o\u2019er.",
    "The merry sleigh-bells! My fond heart swells",
    "And trobs to hear the welcome bells;",
    "Ding-dong, ding-dong, o\u2019er ice and snow,",
    "A voice of gladness, on they go.",
    "Our hut is small, and rude our cheer,",
    "But love has spread the banquet here;",
    "And childhood springs to be caress\u2019d",
    "By our beloved and welcome guest.",
    "With a smiling brow his tale he tells,",
    "The urchins ring the merry sleigh-bells;",
    "The merry sleigh-bells, with shout and song",
    "They drag the noisy string along;",
    "Ding-dong, ding-dong, the father\u2019s come",
    "The gay bells ring his welcome home.",
    "From the cedar swamp the gaunt wolves howl,",
    "From the oak loud whoops the felon owl;",
    "The snow-storm sweeps in thunder past,",
    "The forest creaks beneath the blast;",
    "No more I list, with boding fear,",
    "The sleigh-bells distant chime to hear.",
    "The merry sleigh-bells with soothing power",
    "Shed gladness on the evening hour.",
    "Ding-dong, ding-dong, what rapture swells",
    "The music of those joyous bells!"
