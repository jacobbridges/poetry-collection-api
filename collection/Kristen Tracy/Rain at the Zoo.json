    "A giraffe presented its head to me, tilting it",
    "sideways, reaching out its long gray tongue.",
    "I gave it my wheat cracker while small drops",
    "of rain pounded us both. Lightning cracked open",
    "the sky. Zebras zipped across the field.",
    "It was springtime in Michigan. I watched",
    "the giraffe shuffle itself backwards, toward",
    "the herd, its bone- and rust-colored fur beading",
    "with water. The entire mix of animals stood",
    "away from the trees. A lone emu shook",
    "its round body hard and squawked. It ran",
    "along the fence line, jerking open its wings.",
    "Perhaps it was trying to shake away the burden",
    "of water or indulging an urge to fly. I can\u2019t know.",
    "I have no idea what about their lives these animals",
    "love or abhor. They are captured or born here for us,",
    "and we come. It\u2019s true. This is my favorite field."
