    "News from a foreign country came,",
    "As if my treasures and my joys lay there;",
    "So much it did my heart inflame,",
    "\u2019Twas wont to call my soul into mine ear;",
    "Which thither went to meet",
    "Th\u2019 approaching sweet,",
    "And on the threshold stood",
    "To entertain the secret good;",
    "It hover\u2019d there",
    "As if \u2019twould leave mine ear,",
    "And was so eager to embrace",
    "Th\u2019 expected tidings as they came,",
    "That it could change its dwelling place",
    "To meet the voice of fame.",
    "As if new tidings were the things",
    "Which did comprise my wished unknown treasure,",
    "Or else did bear them on their wings,",
    "With so much joy they came, with so much pleasure,",
    "My soul stood at the gate",
    "To recreate",
    "Itself with bliss, and woo",
    "Its speedier approach; a fuller view",
    "It fain would take,",
    "Yet journeys back would make",
    "Unto my heart, as if \u2019twould fain",
    "Go out to meet, yet stay within,",
    "Fitting a place to entertain",
    "And bring the tidings in.",
    "What sacred instinct did inspire",
    "My soul in childhood with an hope so strong?",
    "What secret force mov\u2019d my desire",
    "T\u2019 expect my joys beyond the seas, so young?",
    "Felicity I knew",
    "Was out of view;",
    "And being left alone,",
    "I thought all happiness was gone",
    "From earth; for this",
    "I long\u2019d for absent bliss,",
    "Deeming that sure beyond the seas,",
    "Or else in something near at hand",
    "Which I knew not, since nought did please",
    "I knew, my bliss did stand.",
    "But little did the infant dream",
    "That all the treasures of the world were by,",
    "And that himself was so the cream",
    "And crown of all which round about did lie.",
    "Yet thus it was! The gem,",
    "The diadem,",
    "The ring enclosing all",
    "That stood upon this earthen ball;",
    "The heav\u2019nly eye,",
    "Much wider than the sky,",
    "Wherein they all included were;",
    "The love, the soul, that was the king",
    "Made to possess them, did appear",
    "A very little thing."
