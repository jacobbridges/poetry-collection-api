    "But that which most I wonder at, which most",
    "I did esteem my bliss, which most I boast,",
    "And ever shall enjoy, is that within",
    "I felt no stain, nor spot of sin.",
    "No darkness then did overshade,",
    "But all within was pure and bright,",
    "No guilt did crush, nor fear invade",
    "But all my soul was full of light.",
    "A joyful sense and purity",
    "Is all I can remember;",
    "The very night to me was bright,",
    "\u2019Twas summer in December.",
    "A serious meditation did employ",
    "My soul within, which taken up with joy",
    "Did seem no outward thing to note, but fly",
    "All objects that do feed the eye.",
    "While it those very objects did",
    "Admire, and prize, and praise, and love,",
    "Which in their glory most are hid,",
    "Which presence only doth remove.",
    "Their constant daily presence I",
    "Rejoicing at, did see;",
    "And that which takes them from the eye",
    "Of others, offer\u2019d them to me.",
    "No inward inclination did I feel",
    "To avarice or pride: my soul did kneel",
    "In admiration all the day. No lust, nor strife,",
    "Polluted then my infant life.",
    "No fraud nor anger in me mov\u2019d,",
    "No malice, jealousy, or spite;",
    "All that I saw I truly lov\u2019d.",
    "Contentment only and delight",
    "Were in my soul. O Heav\u2019n! what bliss",
    "Did I enjoy and feel!",
    "What powerful delight did this",
    "Inspire! for this I daily kneel.",
    "Whether it be that nature is so pure,",
    "And custom only vicious; or that sure",
    "God did by miracle the guilt remove,",
    "And make my soul to feel his love",
    "So early: or that \u2019twas one day,",
    "Wherein this happiness I found;",
    "Whose strength and brightness so do ray,",
    "That still it seems me to surround;",
    "What ere it is, it is a light",
    "So endless unto me",
    "That I a world of true delight",
    "Did then and to this day do see.",
    "That prospect was the gate of Heav\u2019n, that day",
    "The ancient light of Eden did convey",
    "Into my soul: I was an Adam there",
    "A little Adam in a sphere",
    "Of joys! O there my ravish\u2019d sense",
    "Was entertain\u2019d in Paradise,",
    "And had a sight of innocence",
    "Which was beyond all bound and price.",
    "An antepast of Heaven sure!",
    "I on the earth did reign;",
    "Within, without me, all was pure;",
    "I must become a child again."
