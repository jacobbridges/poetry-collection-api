    "You were carried here by hands",
    "and now the wind has you, gritty",
    "as incense, dark sparkles borne",
    "in the shape of blowing,",
    "this great atmospheric bloom,",
    "spinning under the bridge and expanding\u2014",
    "shape of wind and its pattern",
    "of shattering. Having sloughed off",
    "the urn's temporary shape,",
    "there is another of you now\u2014",
    "tell me which to speak to:",
    "the one you were, or are, the one who waited",
    "in the ashes for this scattering, or the one",
    "now added to the already haunted woods,",
    "the woods that sigh and shift their leaves\u2014",
    "where your mystery billows, then breathes."
