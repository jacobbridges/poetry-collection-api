    "Tottering and elastic, middle name of Groan,",
    "ramfeezled after a hard night",
    "at the corpse-polishing plant, slope-",
    "shouldered, a half loaf",
    "of bread, even his hair tired, famished,",
    "fingering the diminished beans",
    "in his pocket\u2014you meet him.",
    "On a thousand street corners you meet him,",
    "emerging from the subway, emerging",
    "from your own chest\u2014this sight\u2019s shrill,",
    "metallic vapors pass into you.",
    "His fear is of being broken,",
    "of becoming too dexterous in stripping",
    "the last few shoelaces of meat",
    "from a chicken\u2019s carcass, of being moved by nothing",
    "short of the Fall of Rome, of being stooped",
    "in the cranium over some loss he\u2019s forgotten",
    "the anniversary of.... You meet him,",
    "know his defeat, though proper",
    "and inevitable, is not yours, although yours also",
    "is proper and inevitable: so many defeats",
    "queer and insignificant (as illustration:",
    "the first time you lay awake all night",
    "waiting for dawn\u2014and were disappointed), so many",
    "no-hope exhaustions hidden,",
    "their gaze dully glazed inward.\u2014And yet we all",
    "fix our binoculars on the horizon\u2019s hazy fear-heaps",
    "and cruise toward them, fat sails",
    "forward.... You meet him on the corners,",
    "in bus stations, on the blind avenues",
    "leading neither in",
    "nor out of hell, you meet him",
    "and with him you walk."
