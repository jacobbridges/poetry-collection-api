    "to help him",
    "I sit with my rifle on a platform",

    "the current than against it.",
    "If a crocodile is aimed from upriver to eat the monkey",
    "and an anaconda from downriver burns",
    "with the same ambition, I do",
    "the math, algebra, angles, rate-of-monkey,",
    "croc- and snake-speed, and if,",
    "it looks as though the anaconda or the croc",
    "will reach the monkey",
    "before he attains the river\u2019s far bank,",
    "I raise my rifle and fire",
    "one, two, three, even four times into the river",
    "just behind the monkey",
    "to hurry him up a little.",
    "Shoot the snake, the crocodile?",
    "They\u2019re just doing their jobs,",
    "but the monkey, the monkey",
    "has little hands like a child\u2019s,",
    "and the smart ones, in a cage, can be taught to smile."
