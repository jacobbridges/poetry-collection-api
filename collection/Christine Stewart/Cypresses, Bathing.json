    "On my way, I come upon them\u2014",
    "A gathering of old women",
    "Soaking their cracked, graying skin,",
    "Their thick bodies sprawling voluptuously:",
    "Knees bent,",
    "Curving out of the water,",
    "Heads thrown back in a tangle of vines and leaves.",
    "I pause a moment,",
    "Waiting to hear their voices echoing with years,",
    "Telling me what I need to know,",
    "But the sun has made them sleepy and secretive;",
    "I hear only their whispered laughter.",
    "They do not trust me;",
    "I am not yet ready to listen."
