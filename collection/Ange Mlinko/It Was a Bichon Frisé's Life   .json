    "Louisiana skies paddle north nodding hello to some exiles",
    "displaced by floodwaters so we all putter in the bisque",
    "in fretted dresses, alleviated by a fan. But we have nothing on",
    "\"Le Matin,\" in whose rococo frame a curtain sweeps to bare",
    "a boudoir, a Bichon Fris\u00e9 worrying something between paws,",
    "begging the dulcet glance of the mistress whose push-up,",
    "cupless corset and up-drawn stocking border what they",
    "fall short of, per the stern frame rippling like a cloud!",
    "Even the candle angles to get a look in the mirror",
    "engloving the scene. Why it is her slipper the bitch clutches!",
    "The gentleman's reverie is elsewhere . . . Loitering",
    "Louisiana stops to admire this engraving by \"N. Lavreinee.\"",
    "What a chevalier! It makes the smeariest sunset think",
    "it's in a Restoration Comedy, in such humidity",
    "chefs defer meringues. \"Ksar Rouge,\" \"Taos Adobe,\"",
    "\"Gulf Shrimp\"\u2014a thousand names of softboiled",
    "lipsticks fritter English as if it were French, meaning",
    "meeting no resistance from the flesh."
