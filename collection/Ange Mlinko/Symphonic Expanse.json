    "If you\u2019d seen",
    "the Gaillardots\u2019 mullein in the Cedars of the Shouf;",
    "if you\u2019d seen the Aleppo dock, red with iron,",
    "in Bcharre where the Adonis River\u2019s said to run as red",
    "with what was",
    "thought his blood; if you\u2019d seen the bearded oat in Burjein,",
    "the rayed white horehound in Tripoli; or maybe",
    "the milkwort in Ehden, as often I saw the strigose bellflower",
    "and the cyclamen,",
    "you might have been the more awed by a mallow-leaved",
    "bindweed in Aley on your way to the brunnera in Baalbek.",
    "The Mediterranean poppy in Nabatieh, Beirut mullein",
    "in nearby Baabda,",
    "connate Alexanders in Qadisha, fodder vetch in Zgharta,",
    "white rocket in Sour, Gypsywort in Marjeyoun,",
    "headed Ziziphora in Baakleen, bladder skullcap in Barouk.",
    "The viscid catchfly,",
    "ah, vying with bats at evening in Zahle\u2014for these the earth",
    "of continuous habitation since the Chalcolithic Age",
    "salivates at dawn. But not a reed grows where no grave is.",
    "In Sacandaga Valley,",
    "two thousand bodies were trans-buried by the boneyard gang.",
    "They ceded the pitted ground to the dentist gang,",
    "whose jackhammers drilled the rock beneath.",
    "Powder monkeys tamped",
    "the holes with dynamite. The beaver-tooth gang\u2019s axes",
    "and cross-cut saws cleared the trees. Bush burners followed.",
    "The fires burned for two years. The patience of dam builders",
    "built a force",
    "equal to the water: It flooded the ashes, the railroad station,",
    "and a train, which I saw transposed in the steely swells,",
    "or so it seemed. But iron turns a torrent red."
