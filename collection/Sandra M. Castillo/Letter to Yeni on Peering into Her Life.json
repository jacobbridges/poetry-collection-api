    "I see you, not as you stand before me,",
    "so full of language threatening to spill from you,",
    "a silver-blue luminous substance the page of cups",
    "might carry in love, in a gold chalice,",
    "but as a child I might have seen, held,",
    "had I been an adult on that island",
    "where we might have become anyone",
    "other than ourselves.",
    "You are a sound you say your father carries,",
    "a beat in the heart of an African drum",
    "that seduced him with the thunder of",
    "the red of blood and earth,",
    "a flesh-pink guava growing inside you,",
    "its seeds on the tips of your fingers",
    "like islands, like memories becoming leaves,",
    "their veined undersides becoming maps,",
    "palmlines, bridges where the sound of water collects childhood",
    "in a blue bucket of memory,",
    "where my T\u00edo Machuco stands with childhood sandwiches I ate",
    "sitting on the cold",
    ", leaning against the Southwest red",
    "of that couch T\u00eda Hilda discarded like a useless memory",
    "when we were no longer voices in open rooms with connecting",
    "doors,",
    "when we were words, onion-skinned paper",
    "as transparent as re-written history or exile."
