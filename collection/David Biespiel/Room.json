    "It was hard to say what made us happiest.",

    "To stir the air? The air that opened",
    "Without fear? Just the branches",
    "And us in a room of wild things?",
    "Like a shapeless flame, it flew",
    "A dozen times around the room.",
    "And, in a wink, a dozen more.",
    "Into the wall, the window, the door.",
    "You said the world turns to parts.",
    "You said the parts are cunning spheres.",
    "You said you always love the face of sin.",
    "You said it\u2019s here, the lips and eyes and skin.",
    "Outside the snow deepened",
    "With heaves of discontent.",
    "Inside, the tremor of our life",
    "Flew in and in and in."
