    "In this poem there is no suffering.",
    "It spans hundreds of years and records",
    "no deaths, connecting when it can,",
    "those moments where people are healthy",
    "and happy, content to be alive. A Chapter,",
    "maybe a Volume, shorn of violence",
    "consists of an adult reading aimlessly.",
    "This line is the length of a full life",
    "smuggled in while no one was plotting",
    "against a neighbour, except in jest.",
    "Then, after a gap, comes Nellie. She",
    "is in a drought-fisted field",
    "with a hoe. This is her twelfth year",
    "on the land, and today her back",
    "doesn\u2019t hurt. Catechisms of self-pity",
    "and of murder have declared a day\u2019s truce",
    "in the Civil War within her. So today,",
    "we can bring Nellie, content with herself,",
    "with the world, into our History.",
    "For a day. In the next generation",
    "we find a suitable subject camping",
    "near the border of a divided country:",
    "for a while no one knows how near. For these",
    "few lines she is ours. But how about",
    "the lovers? you ask, the freshly-washed",
    "body close to yours; sounds, smells, tastes;",
    "anticipation of the young, the edited memory",
    "of the rest of us? How about thoughts",
    "higher than their thinkers?...Yes, yes.",
    "Give them half a line and a mass of footnotes:",
    "they have their own privileged history,",
    "like inherited income beside our husbandry.",
    "We bring our History up to date",
    "in a city like London: someone\u2019s just paid",
    "the mortgage, is free of guilt",
    "and not dying of cancer; and going",
    "past the news-stand, doesn\u2019t see a headline",
    "advertising torture. This is all",
    "recommended reading, but in small doses.",
