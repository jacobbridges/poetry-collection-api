    "Geneticist as driver, down the gene",
    "codes in, let's say, a topless coupe",
    "and you keep expecting bends,",
    "real tyre-testers on tight",
    "mountain passes, but instead it's dead",
    "straight, highway as runway,",
    "helix unravelled as vista,",
    "as vanishing point. Keep your foot",
    "down. This is a finite desert.",
    "You move too fast to read it,",
    "the order of the rocks, the cacti,",
    "roadside weeds, a blur to you.",
    "Every hour or so, you pass a shack",
    "which passes for a motel here:",
    "tidy faded rooms with TVs on",
    "for company, the owner pacing out",
    "his empty parking lot. And after",
    "each motel you hit a sandstorm",
    "thick as fog, but agony.",
    "Somewhere out there are remnants",
    "of our evolution, genes for how",
    "to fly south, sense a storm,",
    "hunt at night, how to harden",
    "your flesh into hide or scales.",
    "These are the miles of dead code.",
    "Every desert has them.",
    "You are on a mission to discover",
    "why the human heart still slows",
    "when divers break the surface,",
    "why mermaids still swim in our dreams."
