    "Think of the woman who first touched fire",
    "to a hollow stone filled with seal oil,",
    "how she fiddled with fuel and flame",
    "until blue shadows before and after her",
    "filled her house, crowded",
    "the underground, then",
    "fled like sky-captains",
    "chasing the aurora\u2019s whale tale",
    "green beyond the earth\u2019s curve.",
    "Her tenth summer, the elders let her",
    "raise her issum, seal pup orphaned",
    "when hunters brought in her mother,",
    "their grins of plenty",
    "broad, red. The women",
    "slit the hard belly.",
    "Plopped among the ruby innards",
    "steaming on rough-cut planks",
    "blinked a new sea-child",
    "whose first sound",
    "came out a question",
    "in the old language, a question",
    "that in one throaty bark",
    "asked",
    ", meaning What family",
    "is this? What comfort",
    "do you provide for guests?",
    "Do you let strangers remain",
    "strangers? The women rinsed the slick pup",
    "in cool water, crafted a pouch",
    "for her to suck. Then the young girl",
    "whose hands held light",
    "even when the room did not",
    "brought this new being",
    "beside her bed, let it scatter",
    "babiche and split birch",
    "gathered for snowshoes, let it",
    "nose the caribou neck hairs",
    "bearding her dance fans. They",
    "held up the fans to their foreheads,",
    "playing white hair, playing old.",
    "In the time when women do not sew",
    "the seal danced at her first potlatch.",
    "And when the lamps burned down,",
    "no one could see",
    "any difference between waves",
    "in rock, waves in sea.",
    "The pup lifted her nose, licked",
    "salt from seven stars, and slipped",
    "light back among silvers and chum",
    "light among the ghostly belugas",
    "swimming far north to offer themselves."
