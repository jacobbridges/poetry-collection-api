    "We drove through the gates",
    "into a maze of little roads,",
    "with speed bumps now,",
    "that circled a pavilion,",
    "field house, and ran past",
    "the playing fields and wound",
    "their way up to the cluster",
    "of wood and stone buildings",
    "of the school you went to once.",
    "The green was returning to",
    "the trees and lawn, the lake",
    "was still half-lidded with ice",
    "and blind in the middle.",
    "There was nobody around",
    "except a few cars in front",
    "of the administration. It must",
    "have been spring break.",
    "We left without ever getting out",
    "of the car. You were quiet",
    "that night, the next day,",
    "the way after heavy rain",
    "that the earth cannot absorb,",
    "the water lies in pools",
    "in unexpected places for days",
    "until it disappears."
