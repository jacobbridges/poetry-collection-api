    "I can\u2019t tell you I had climbed for hours on",
    "ledges and crawled through gaps in the earth.",
    "My hands negotiating",
    "through the teeth of the palisade",
    "lipped under the vineyard of temperate skies.",
    "And I can\u2019t tell you that I came",
    "onto a ledge within the shelter of a granite roof,",
    "ceaselessly carved by centuries of dripping water.",
    "Feeding from pooled water and singular sunlight",
    "a chamisa plant sat like a chopped wood.",
    "The opposite end of root",
    "speaking for its entirety through",
    "silence and color.",
    "And I wish I could tell you that at the moment",
    "I met its splitting scent under the enormity of stone",
    "your name appeared in my throat with clarity.",
    "And I wish we were old",
    "and in front of a grand painting,",
    "a picture or postcard of",
    "Picasso\u2019s \u201cGuernica\u201d perhaps.",
    "It would be then that I would tell you",
    "Picasso once said that it took him his entire life",
    "to learn how to paint like a child.",
    "It would be through these words",
    "that would make you understand",
    "the same clarity that pooled over me",
    "on that ledge those years before",
    "when as a young man I extended",
    "like direction, like timbre itself",
    "for a dying song that echoed your name."
