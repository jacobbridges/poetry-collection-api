    "sound knots",
    "pinned to a fabric-less body form of oak bone",
    "a barreled chest",
    "the presence of acoustic music over the instrument",
    "resting on your lap",
    "a limited vehicle but you knew that",
    "having learned tablature",
    "the guitar posed in sculpture",
    "clear its throat by reaching the oval gap flushed",
    "against stomach into its curious sound",
    "gather fingers around an inexhaustible voice and play the strings",
    "bread shaped to song as we ate and fidgeted",
    "the pitch of river",
    "frozen to stillness a film",
    "reeled and taut",
    "swelling water",
    "oily in its cold",
    "steps before it hardens",
    "an utterance before song is shaped",
    "a compression of freezing water",
    "eating away at its own babbling face",
    "where are the boxes of clothes",
    "the newspaper to scoop inside of cups",
    "feel free to comment",
    "miss nothing as of chewing a new food",
    "these are features of comfort",
    "a lower altitude,",
    "moved further but no egg crate to snug the ends of the hutch",
    "a chimera of tempered sand",
    "speak of her house absolved by the wiping ocean",
    "speak of her name by way of mountains",
    "the mirrors silver flaking for the edges of the mirrors",
    "leaving only glass unreflective patches",
    "the promised half",
    "the unanswerable ruin of aperture begging",
    "from where you haven\u2019t seen yourself in years"
