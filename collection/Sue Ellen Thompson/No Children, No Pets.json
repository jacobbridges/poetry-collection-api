    "I bring the cat\u2019s body home from the vet\u2019s",
    "in a running-shoe box held shut",
    "with elastic bands. Then I clean",
    "the corners where she has eaten and",
    "slept, scrubbing the hard bits of food",
    "from the baseboard, dumping the litter",
    "and blasting the pan with a hose. The plastic",
    "dishes I hide in the basement, the pee-",
    "soaked towel I put in the trash. I put",
    "the catnip mouse in the box and I put",
    "the box away, too, in a deep",
    "dirt drawer in the earth.",
    "When the death-energy leaves me,",
    "I go to the room where my daughter slept",
    "in nursery school, grammar school, high school,",
    "I lie on her milky bedspread and think",
    "of the day I left her at college, how nothing",
    "could keep me from gouging the melted candle-wax",
    "out from between her floorboards,",
    "or taking a razor blade to the decal",
    "that said to the firemen, \u201cBreak",
    "this window first.\u201d I close my eyes now",
    "and enter a place that\u2019s clearly",
    "expecting me, swaddled in loss",
    "and then losing that, too, as I move",
    "from room to bone-white room",
    "in the house of the rest of my life."
