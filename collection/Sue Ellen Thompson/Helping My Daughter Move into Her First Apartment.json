    "This is all I am to her now:",
    "a pair of legs in running shoes,",
    "two arms strung with braided wire.",
    "She heaves a carton sagging with CDs",
    "at me and I accept it gladly, lifting",
    "with my legs, not bending over,",
    "raising each foot high enough",
    "to clear the step. Fortunate to be",
    "of any use to her at all,",
    "I wrestle, stooped and single-handed,",
    "with her mattress in the stairwell,",
    "saying nothing as it pins me,",
    "sweating, to the wall. Vacuum cleaner,",
    "spiny cactus, five-pound sacks",
    "of rice and lentils slumped",
    "against my heart: up one flight",
    "of stairs and then another,",
    "down again with nothing in my arms."
