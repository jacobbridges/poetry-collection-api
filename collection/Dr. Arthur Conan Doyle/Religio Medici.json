    "God\u2019s own best will bide the test",

    "Be solid at the core;",
    "And Plague and Fever, that the whole",
    "Be changing evermore.",
    "He strews the microbes in the lung,",
    "The blood-clot in the brain;",
    "With test and test He picks the best,",
    "Then test them once again.",
    "He tests the body and the mind,",
    "He rings them o\u2019er and o\u2019er;",
    "And if they crack, He throws them back,",
    "And fashions them once more.",
    "He chokes the infant throat with slime,",
    "He sets the ferment free;",
    "He builds the tiny tube of lime",
    "That blocks the artery.",
    "He lets the youthful dreamer store",
    "Great projects in his brain,",
    "Until He drops the fungus spore",
    "That smears them out again.",
    "He stores the milk that feeds the babe,",
    "He dulls the tortured nerve;",
    "He gives a hundred joys of sense",
    "Where few or none might serve.",
    "And still He trains the branch of good",
    "Where the high blossoms be,",
    "And wieldeth still the shears of ill",
    "To prune and prune His tree."
