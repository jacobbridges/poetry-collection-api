    "The irresistible and benevolent light",
    "brushes through the angel-wing begonias,",
    "the clippings of ruddy ears for the living room.",
    "Intimate motes, debris of grounded, forlorn walks,",
    "speckle through the vitreous quality of blush.",
    "As fluid lulls turn like trout backs, azure-tipped fins",
    "oscillate in the shallows, the clear floating",
    "is dizziness.",
    "Tender events are meeting halves and wholes of affinity,",
    "the recurrence of whimsy and parallel streams",
    "flush away the blockage of malaise.",
    "Incessant gratitude, pliable kindness smolders",
    "in the husk of these sweet accumulations:",
    "abalone shells, the thoughtful carvings from friends,",
    "the stone of another\u2019s pocket, the photo of mystified",
    "moon over water, the smiles of worn chairs.",
    "Austere hopes find pleasure in lately cherished flowers.",
    "The blooms are articulate deluge, hues of delicacy.",
    "Petals parted dim renderings, the viable imprint",
    "of the blood-hot beam of light with reformed courage.",
    "Beveling the finish to suppression, the blade of choice",
    "brings the flourish of dividing while adequately doubling",
    "worth by two. Multiplying. The luminescent burning of space.",
    "The heat is a domicile as abandoned as red roses budding",
    "their ascension from stem.",
    "The sun has its own drum contenting itself with the rose",
    "heart it takes into continual rumbling. The connection",
    "of surface and hand. The great head of dark clouds finds",
    "its own place of unraveled repercussions and disruption,",
    "elsewhere, over the tall, staunch mountains of indemnity."
