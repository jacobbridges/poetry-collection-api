    "You sit in a chair, touched by nothing, feeling",
    "the old self become the older self, imagining",
    "only the patience of water, the boredom of stone.",
    "You think that silence is the extra page,",
    "you think that nothing is good or bad, not even",
    "the darkness that fills the house while you sit watching",
    "it happen. You\u2019ve seen it happen before. Your friends",
    "move past the window, their faces soiled with regret.",
    "You want to wave but cannot raise your hand.",
    "You sit in a chair. You turn to the nightshade spreading",
    "a poisonous net around the house. You taste",
    "the honey of absence. It is the same wherever",
    "you are, the same if the voice rots before",
    "the body, or the body rots before the voice.",
    "You know that desire leads only to sorrow, that sorrow",
    "leads to achievement which leads to emptiness.",
    "You know that this is different, that this",
    "is the celebration, the only celebration,",
    "that by giving yourself over to nothing,",
    "you shall be healed. You know there is joy in feeling",
    "your lungs prepare themselves for an ashen future,",
    "so you wait, you stare and you wait, and the dust settles",
    "and the miraculous hours of childhood wander in darkness."
