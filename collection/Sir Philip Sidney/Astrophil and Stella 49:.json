    "I on my horse, and Love on me, doth try",
    "Our horsemanships, while by strange work I prove",
    "A horseman to my horse, a horse to Love,",
    "And now man\u2019s wrongs in me, poor beast, descry.",
    "The reins wherewith my rider doth me tie",
    "Are humbled thoughts, which bit of reverence move,",
    "Curbed in with fear, but with gilt boss above",
    "Of hope, which makes it seem fair to the eye.",
    "The wand is will; thou, fancy, saddle art,",
    "Girt fast by memory; and while I spur",
    "My horse, he spurs with sharp desire to my heart;",
    "He sits me fast, however I do stir;",
    "And now hath made me to his hand so right",
    "That in the manage myself takes delight."
