    "Having this day my horse, my hand, my lance",
    "Guided so well that I obtain'd the prize,",
    "Both by the judgment of the English eyes",
    "And of some sent from that sweet enemy France;",
    "Horsemen my skill in horsemanship advance,",
    "Town folks my strength; a daintier judge applies",
    "His praise to sleight which from good use doth rise;",
    "Some lucky wits impute it but to chance;",
    "Others, because of both sides I do take",
    "My blood from them who did excel in this,",
    "Think Nature me a man of arms did make.",
    "How far they shot awry! The true cause is,",
    "Stella look'd on, and from her heav'nly face",
    "Sent forth the beams which made so fair my race."
