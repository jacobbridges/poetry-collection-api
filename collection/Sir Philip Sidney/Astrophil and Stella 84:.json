    "Highway, since you my chief Parnassus be,",
    "And that my Muse, to some ears not unsweet,",
    "Tempers her words to trampling horses' feet",
    "More oft than to a chamber melody.",
    "Now, blessed you bear onward blessed me",
    "To her, where I my heart, safe-left, shall meet:",
    "My Muse and I must you of duty greet",
    "With thanks and wishes, wishing thankfully.",
    "Be you still fair, honour'd by public heed;",
    "By no encroachment wrong'd, nor time forgot,",
    "Nor blam'd for blood, nor sham'd for sinful deed;",
    "And that you know I envy you no lot",
    "Of highest wish, I wish you so much bliss,i",
    "Hundreds of years you Stella's feet may kiss."
