    "My true-love hath my heart and I have his,",
    "By just exchange one for the other given:",
    "I hold his dear, and mine he cannot miss;",
    "There never was a bargain better driven.",
    "His heart in me keeps me and him in one;",
    "My heart in him his thoughts and senses guides:",
    "He loves my heart, for once it was his own;",
    "I cherish his because in me it bides.",
    "His heart his wound received from my sight;",
    "My heart was wounded with his wounded heart;",
    "For as from me on him his hurt did light,",
    "So still, methought, in me his hurt did smart:",
    "Both equal hurt, in this change sought our bliss,",
    "My true love hath my heart and I have his."
