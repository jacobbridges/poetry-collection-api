    "Your words my friend (right healthful caustics) blame",
    "My young mind marred, whom Love doth windlass so,",
    "That mine own writings like bad servants show",
    "My wits, quick in vain thoughts, in virtue lame,",
    "That Plato I read for nought, but if he tame",
    "Such coltish gyres, that to my birth I owe",
    "Nobler desires, least else that friendly foe,",
    "Great expectation, wear a train of shame.",
    "For since mad March great promise made of me,",
    "If now the May of my years much decline,",
    "What can be hoped my harvest time will be?",
    "Sure you say well, your wisdom\u2019s golden mine",
    "Dig deep with learning\u2019s spade, now tell me this,",
    "Hath this world ought so fair as Stella is?"
