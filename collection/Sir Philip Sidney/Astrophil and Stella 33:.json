    "I might!\u2014unhappy word\u2014O me, I might,",
    "And then would not, or could not, see my bliss;",

    "I find how heav'nly day, wretch! I did miss.",
    "Heart, rend thyself, thou dost thyself but right;",
    "No lovely Paris made thy Helen his,",
    "No force, no fraud robb'd thee of thy delight,",
    "Nor Fortune of thy fortune author is;",
    "But to myself myself did give the blow,",
    "While too much wit, forsooth, so troubled me",
    "That I respects for both our sakes must show:",
    "And yet could not by rising morn foresee",
    "How fair a day was near: O punish'd eyes,",
    "That I had been more foolish,\u2014or more wise!"
