    "Same size, my parents stained and tore",
    "alike in the barn, their brown hair",
    "ripe as cow after twelve hours of gutters.",
    "At supper they spoke in jokey moos.",
    "Sure, showers could dampen that reek",
    "down to a whiff under fingernails, behind ears,",
    "but no wash could wring the animal from their clothes:",
    "one pair, two pair, husband, wife, reversible."
