    "When in Wisconsin where I once had time",
    "the flyway swans came whistling",
    "to the rotten Green Bay ice and stayed,",
    "not feeding, four days, maybe five, I shouted",
    "and threw stones to see them fly.",
    "Blue herons followed, or came first.",
    "I shot a bittern\u2019s wing off with my gun.",
    "For that my wife could cry.",
    "My neighbor\u2019s wife mistook the spawning frogs",
    "for wood ducks nesting the white pines",
    "up on Bean Hill: I straightway",
    "set her right. Each April, on the first",
    "rainy night I lantern-hunt for salamanders",
    "where they hide, toewalking the bottom",
    "mucks and muds. I shudder",
    "at the scored skin of their sides, the deep",
    "flesh tucks. In hand, they dry. I walk",
    "in frogspawn jellies on my lawns. One time I hoped",
    "the great white birds might brake",
    "for the frog ditch and alight,",
    "but all the addled past falls in on itself,",
    "splash rings close inward on the rising stone,",
    "my gun sucks fire, the bone becomes",
    "whole bone, light narrows back",
    "on point and filament, the forest turns to sand,",
    "and only season lacking source rolls round",
    "and round, till I in my turns fall forever back",
    "clutching my stone, my gun, my light.",
    "When in Wisconsin where I once had time",
    "and spring beasts gorged my marrows and my tongue,",
    "I was not blind: the red eft clambered",
    "in my eye."
