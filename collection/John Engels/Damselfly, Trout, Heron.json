    "The damselfly folds its wings",
    "over its body when at rest. Captured,",
    "it should not be killed",
    "in cyanide, but allowed to die",
    "slowly: then the colors,",
    "especially the reds and blues,",
    "will last. In the hand",
    "it crushes easily into a rosy",
    "slime. Its powers of flight",
    "are weak. The trout",
    "feeds on the living damselfly.",
    "The trout leaps up from the water,",
    "and if there is sun you see",
    "the briefest shiver of gold,",
    "and then the river again.",
    "When the trout dies",
    "it turns its white belly",
    "to the mirror of the sky.",
    "The heron fishes for the trout",
    "in the gravelly shallows on the far",
    "side of the stream. The heron",
    "is the exact blue of the shadows",
    "the sun makes of trees on water.",
    "When you hold the heron most clearly",
    "in your eye, you are least certain",
    "it is there. When the blue heron dies,",
    "it lies beyond reach",
    "on the far side of the river."
