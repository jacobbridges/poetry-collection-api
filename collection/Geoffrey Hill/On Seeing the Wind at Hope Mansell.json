    "Whether or not shadows are of the substance",
    "such is the expectation I can",
    "wait to surprise my vision as a wind",
    "enters the valley: sudden and silent",
    "in its arrival, drawing to full cry",
    "the whorled invisibilities, glassen towers",
    "freighted with sky-chaff; that, as barnstorming",
    "powers, rammack the small",
    "orchard; that well-steaded oaks",
    "ride stolidly, that rake the light-leafed ash,",
    "that glowing yew trees, cumbrous, heave aside.",
    "Amidst and abroad tumultuous lumina,",
    "regents, reagents, cloud-f\u00eated, sun-ordained,",
    "fly tally over hedgerows, across fields."
