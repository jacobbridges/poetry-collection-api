    "Nothing to tell why I cannot write",
    "; nobody to narrate this",
    "latter acknowledgement: the self that counts",
    "words to a line, accountable survivor",
    "pain-wedged, pinioned in the cleft trunk,",
    "less petty than a sprite, poisonous as Ariel",
    "to Prospero's own knowledge. In my room",
    "a vase of peacock feathers. I will attempt",
    "to describe them, as if for evidence",
    "on which a life depends. Except for the eyes",
    "they are threadbare, the threads hanging",
    "as from a luminate tough weed in February.",
    "But those eyes\u2014like a Greek letter,",
    "omega, fossiled in an Indian shawl;",
    "like a shaved cross section of living tissue,",
    "the edge metallic blue, the core of jet,",
    "the white of the eye in fact closer to beige,",
    "the whole encircled with a black-fringed green.",
    "The peacock roosts alone on a Scots pine",
    "at the garden end, in blustery twilight",
    "his lambent cloak stark as a warlock's cape,",
    "the maharajah-bird that scavenges",
    "close by the stone-troughed, stone-terraced, stone-ensurfed",
    "Suffolk shoreline; at times displays his scream."
