    "For whom the possessed sea littered, on both shores,",
    "Ruinous arms; being fired, and for good,",
    "To sound the constitution of just wars,",
    "Men, in their eloquent fashion, understood.",
    "Relieved of soul, the dropping-back of dust,",
    "Their usage, pride, admitted within doors;",
    "At home, under caved chantries, set in trust,",
    "With well-dressed alabaster and proved spurs",
    "They lie; they lie; secure in the decay",
    "Of blood, blood-marks, crowns hacked and coveted,",
    "Before the scouring fires of trial-day",
    "Alight on men; before sleeked groin, gored head,",
    "Budge through the clay and gravel, and the sea",
    "Across daubed rock evacuates its dead."
