    "The creature that had once",
    "been a man handed over his petition,",
    "a stained and grimy scrap,",
    "handed it to his lord and master,",
    "a petition asking to be transferred",
    "to the status of a horse.",
    "You son-of-a-whore, the master,",
    "kicking for good measure, bellowed.",

    "one day off in ten. As is,",
    "I have none. As a horse,",

    "during work. As a former",
    "man, I cannot. As a horse,",

    "hungry, and hungry, I",
    "work less and get less",
    "bread, so I can barely stand.",

    "and two blankets. I have",
    "no blankets, no jacket.",
    "If a driver beats",
    "a horse too hard, he",
    "is punished, for a horse",
    "is precious. If the brigadiers",
    "beat and kick me, it is like",
    "beating a tree. So you see,",
    "a prisoner is nothing here.",
    "But a horse?",
    "A horse is something!",
    "Inside the frozen",
    "and the broken",
    "vista, the plea had a ring",
    "of truth heard",
    "even by the lord",
    "and master, who had",
    "previously been a man himself,",
    "and who, when no other",
    "former men could see,",
    "attached that name",
    "to the page, granting",
    "the horse a stable and two blankets."
