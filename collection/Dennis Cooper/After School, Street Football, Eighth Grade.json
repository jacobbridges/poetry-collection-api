    "Their jeans sparkled, cut off",
    "way above the knee, and my",
    "friends and I would watch them",
    "from my porch, books of poems",
    "lost in our laps, eyes wide as",
    "tropical fish behind our glasses.",
    "Their football flashed from hand",
    "to hand, tennis shoes gripped",
    "the asphalt, sweat's spotlight on",
    "their strong backs. We would",
    "dream of hugging them, and crouch",
    "later in weird rooms, and come.",
    "Once their ball fell our way",
    "so two of them came over, hands",
    "on their hips, asking us to",
    "throw it to them, which Arthur did,",
    "badly, and they chased it back.",
    "One turned to yell, \u201cThanks\u201d",
    "and we dreamed of his long",
    "teeth in our necks. We",
    "wanted them to wander over,",
    "place deep wet underarms to",
    "our lips, and then their white",
    "asses, then those loud mouths.",
    "One day one guy was very tired,",
    "didn't move fast enough,",
    "so a car hit him and he sprawled",
    "fifty feet away, sexy, but he was",
    "dead, blood like lipstick, then",
    "those great boys stood together",
    "on the sidewalk and we joined them,",
    "mixing in like one big friendship",
    "to the cops, who asked if we were,",
    "and those boys were too sad to counter.",
    "We'd known his name, Tim, and how",
    "he'd turned to thank us nicely",
    "but now he was under a sheet",
    "anonymous as God, the big boys crying,",
    "spitting words, and we stunned",
    "like intellectuals get, our high",
    "voices soft as the tinkling of a",
    "chandelier on a ceiling too high to see."
