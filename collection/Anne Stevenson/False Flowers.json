    "They were to have been a love gift,",
    "but when she slit the paper funnel,",
    "they both saw they were fake; false flowers",
    "he'd picked in haste from the store's display,",
    "handmade coloured stuff, stiff as crinoline.",
    "Instantly she thought of women's hands",
    "cutting in grimy light by a sweatshop window;",
    "rough plank tables strewn with cut-out",
    "flower heads: lily, iris, primula, scentless",
    "chrysanthemums, pistils rigged on wire",
    "in crowns of sponge-tipped stamens,",
    "sepals and petals perfect, perfectly",
    "immune to menaces from the garden.",
    "Why so wrong, so...flattening? Why not instead",
    "symbols of unchanging love?",
    "Yet pretty enough,",
    "she considered, arranging them in a vase",
    "with dry grass and last summer's hydrangeas",
    "whose deadness was still (how to put it?)",
    "alive, or maybe the other side of life.",
    "Two sides, really, of the same thing?",
    "She laughed a little, such ideas were embarrassing",
    "even when kept to oneself,",
    "but her train of thought",
    "carried her in its private tunnel through supper,",
    "and at bedtime, brushing her teeth,",
    "she happened to look up at the moon.",
    "Its sunlit face was turned, as always, in her direction.",
    ", she couldn't help thinking,",
    "though we see only half of it.",
    "It was an insight she decided she could",
    "share with him, but when he joined her",
    "and together they lay in the dark,",
    "there seemed no reason to say anything.",
    "The words, in any case, would be wrong,",
    "would escape or disfigure her meaning.",
    "was the syllable she murmured to him,",
    "fading into sleep. And just for a split second,",
    "teetering on the verge of it, she believed",
    "everything that had to be was understood."
