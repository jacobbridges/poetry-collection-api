    "The spirit is too blunt an instrument",
    "to have made this baby.",
    "Nothing so unskilful as human passions",
    "could have managed the intricate",
    "exacting particulars: the tiny",
    "blind bones with their manipulating tendons,",
    "the knee and the knucklebones, the resilient",
    "fine meshings of ganglia and vertebrae,",
    "the chain of the difficult spine.",
    "Observe the distinct eyelashes and sharp crescent",
    "fingernails, the shell-like complexity",
    "of the ear, with its firm involutions",
    "concentric in miniature to minute",
    "ossicles. Imagine the",
    "infinitesimal capillaries, the flawless connections",
    "of the lungs, the invisible neural filaments",
    "through which the completed body",
    "already answers to the brain.",
    "Then name any passion or sentiment",
    "possessed of the simplest accuracy.",
    "No, no desire or affection could have done",
    "with practice what habit",
    "has done perfectly, indifferently,",
    "through the body's ignorant precision.",
    "It is left to the vagaries of the mind to invent",
    "love and despair and anxiety",
    "and their pain."
