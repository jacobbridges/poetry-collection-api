    "You shout my name",
    "from beyond my dreams,",
    "beyond the picture window",
    "of this Rosarito beach house.",
    "Rushing from bed to shore",
    "I glimpse their backs\u2014",
    "volcanoes rising out of the sea.",
    "Your back, a blue-black silhouette,",
    "feet wet with the wash of morning waves.",
    "Fountains spring from mammal minds,",
    "my hands lifting a splash of sand.",
    "I'm on my knees,",
    "toes finding a cool prayer",
    "beneath them, fingers pressing",
    "sea foam to my temples,",
    "while you open arms wide as a generation,",
    "raise them to a compass point,",
    "dive.",
    "If you could reach them,",
    "you would ride their fins",
    "under the horizon,",
    "then surf the crash of waves",
    "left in their wake.",
    "And if I could grasp",
    "my own fear,",
    "I'd drown it,",
    "leave it breathless and blue",
    "as this ocean,",
    "as the brilliant backs",
    "of whales",
    "surfacing",
    "for air."
