    "The hands of this telling tree pull",
    "him from the cobalt bowl sky,",
    "bring Jimmy back to the ruins",
    "of Maxwell Street hunched in dusk.",
    "He stood where strings intersected",
    "frets like tracks meeting ties",
    "on the Illinois Central\u2019s passage",
    "from the Mississippi Delta,",
    "then followed the bread crumbs",
    "of troubadours to this steel city.",
    "Twelve-hour shifts beckoned",
    "mexicanos north on the Union Pacific",
    "from Piedras Negras",
    "to Pilsen, Back of the Yards.",
    "How many grandparents, mothers and fathers,",
    "pounded stake into soil,",
    "snuck or were shoved into boxcars,",
    "leapt onto the train\u2019s iron rungs",
    "as it shuddered along the rails",
    "to foundries where they poured",
    "molten metal, faced hot licks",
    "of the blast furnace\u2019s growl and hiss?",
    "How many lugged themselves north",
    "to slaughterhouses that drooled",
    "rank puddles at their feet? This,",
    "so sons and daughters might step off",
    "into another era, choose instruments of wood and metal,",
    "axes of their own timbre.",
    "This so Jimmy might mix his own palette\u2014",
    "tune each turquoise pitch and purple tone",
    "into an electric blues old as corridos,",
    "but new to the mexicanos who came each",
    "Sunday to the market at Maxwell.",
    "New to the ears of Roberto, a boy, who would keep",
    "his ranchera rhythms close",
    "as a pair of old jeans but grow",
    "into the blues as he listened",
    "to the heirs of Papa Jackson\u2014",
    "Johnny Young, Howlin\u2019 Wolf, Nighthawk",
    "and Maxwell Jimmy. Now Roberto sits in overalls",
    "at an easel, splits",
    "the hairs of his brush over how to compose",
    "this ofrenda, this homage. How",
    "to take Jimmy back in time to the market",
    "whose merchants once hustled",
    "with tricks for trade ancient as Africa, as Toltec Mexico,",
    "Maxwell, whose live blues bands",
    "and car radios belting norte\u00f1o mixes made",
    "every Sunday a session.",
    "How to take Jimmy back",
    "to Maxwell\u2019s gathering spot where he guzzles",
    "from an aluminum garden blooming atop his amp,",
    "swings his ax\u2014",
    "fingers climbing its trunk, plucking twigs\u2014",
    "while our feet tap the roots",
    "of this wailing tree. Notes skip through alleys",
    "of his voice like gravel",
    "pinging off windshields, lift a pitch",
    "high enough to singe the autumn sky\u2014",
    "cousin to the red and green gritos of the barrio",
    "only blocks away. Twelve bars spin",
    "like metal rims, stack like hubcaps,",
    "chords crackling in the tin barrels of his laughter.",
    "When the people gather, he sputters,",
    "and waits for them to peer into the devil\u2019s draw",
    "of his eyes before he roars,",
    "But we barely get to the punch line, to the end",
    "of a set, before the mayor swings his ax,",
    "a claw that rips this \u00e1rbol de blues up by its roots;",
    "before Chicago swings its wrecking ball",
    "to level homes, stores, restaurants, bars;",
    "before troops graffiti-blast, scrub and cinch-sack it",
    "all, but one empty wall",
    "where someone has scrawled Jimmy\u2019s name",
    "among the others in this hall of fame:",
    "Willie, Hound Dog, Honey Boy, Sal,",
    "the many legends who\u2019ve shared the marrow",
    "of their music, of Santana\u2019s hearty",
    "steaming with sabor",
    "and sometimes weeping."
