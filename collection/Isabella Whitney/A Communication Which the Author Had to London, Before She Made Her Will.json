    "The time is come, I must depart",
    "from thee, ah famous city;",
    "I never yet to rue my smart,",
    "did find that thou had\u2019st pity.",
    "Wherefore small cause there is, that I",
    "should grieve from thee to go;",
    "But many women foolishly,",
    "like me, and other moe,",
    "Do such a fix\u00e8d fancy set,",
    "on those which least deserve,",
    "That long it is ere wit we get",
    "away from them to swerve.",
    "But time with pity oft will tell",
    "to those that will her try,",
    "Whether it best be more to mell,",
    "or utterly defy.",
    "And now hath time me put in mind",
    "of thy great cruelness,",
    "That never once a help would find,",
    "to ease me in distress.",
    "Thou never yet would\u2019st credit give",
    "to board me for a year;",
    "Nor with apparel me relieve,",
    "except thou pay\u00e8d were.",
    "No, no, thou never did\u2019st me good,",
    "nor ever wilt, I know.",
    "Yet am I in no angry mood,",
    "but will, or ere I go,",
    "In perfect love and charity,",
    "my testament here write,",
    "And leave to thee such treasury,",
    "as I in it recite.",
    "Now stand aside and give me leave",
    "to write my latest will;",
    "And see that none you do deceive",
    "of that I leave them till."
