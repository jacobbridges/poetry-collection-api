    "Because I to my brethern wrote",
    "and to my sisters two:",
    "Good sister Anne, you this might wote,",
    "if so I should not do",
    "To you, or ere I parted hence,",
    "You vainly had bestowed expence.",
    "Yet is it not for that I write,",
    "for nature did you bind",
    "To do me good, and to requite",
    "hath nature me inclined:",
    "Wherefore good sister take in gree",
    "These simple lines that come from me.",
    "Wherein I wish you Nestor's days,",
    "in happy health to rest:",
    "With such success in all assays",
    "as those which God hath blest:",
    "Your husband with your pretty boys,",
    "God keep them free from all annoys.",
    "And grant if that my luck it be",
    "to linger here so long",
    "Till they be men, that I may see",
    "for learning them so strong",
    "That they may march amongst the best",
    "Of them which learning have possest.",
    "By that time will my aged years",
    "perhaps a staff require:",
    "And quakingly as still in fears",
    "my limbs draw to the fire:",
    "Yet joy I shall them so to see,",
    "If any joy in age there be.",
    "Good sister so I you commend",
    "to him that made us all:",
    "I know you huswifery intend,",
    "though I to writing fall:",
    "Wherefore no lenger shall you stay",
    "From business that profit may.",
    "Had I a husband, or a house,",
    "and all that longs thereto,",
    "My self could frame about to rouse,",
    "as other women do:",
    "But till some household cares me tie,",
    "My books and pen I will apply."
