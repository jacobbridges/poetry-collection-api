    "How untouchable the girls arm-locked strutting",
    "up the main hall of Central High unopposed",
    "for decades looked. I flattened myself against",
    "the wall, unnerved by their cloudsea of \u00e9lan,",
    "which pounced upon any timid girl regrettably",
    "in their way, their high-wattage lifting slow motion",
    "like curls of light strands of honey. The swagger",
    "behind their blue-tinted sunglasses and low-rider",
    "jeans hurt boys like me, so vast the worlds",
    "between us, even the slightest whiff of recognition,",
    "an accidental side glance, an unintended tongue-piercing",
    "display of Juicy Fruit chew, was intoxicating",
    "and could wildly cast a chess-playing geek into",
    "a week-long surmise of inner doubts, likelihoods,",
    "and depressions. You might say my whole life led",
    "to celebrating youth and how it snubs and rebuffs.",
    "Back then I learned to avoid what I feared",
    "and to place my third-string hopes on a game-winning",
    "basketball shot, sure it would slow them to a stop,",
    "pan their lip-glossed smiles, blessing me with their cool."
