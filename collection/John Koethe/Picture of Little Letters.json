    "I think I like this room.",
    "The curtains and the furniture aren\u2019t the same",
    "Of course, but the light comes in the window as it used to",
    "Late in the morning, after the others had gone to work.",
    "You can even shave in it. On the dresser with the mirror",
    "Are a couple of the pictures we took one afternoon",
    "Last May, walking down the alley in the late sunlight.",
    "I remember now how we held hands for fifteen minutes",
    "Afterwards. The words meander through the mirror",
    "But I don\u2019t want them now, I don\u2019t want these abbreviations.",
    "What I want in poetry is a kind of abstract photography",
    "Of the nerves, but what I like in photography",
    "Is the poetry of literal pictures of the neighborhood.",
    "The late afternoon sunlight is slanting through the window",
    "Again, sketching the room in vague gestures of discontent",
    "That roll off the mind, and then only seem to disappear.",
    "What am I going to do now? And how am I going to sleep tonight?",
    "A peculiar name flickers in the mirror, and then disappears."
