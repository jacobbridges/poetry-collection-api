    "It starts in sadness and bewilderment,",
    "The self-reflexive iconography",
    "Of late adolescence, and a moment",
    "When the world dissolves into a fable",
    "Of an alternative geography",
    "Beyond the threshold of the visible.",
    "And the heart is a kind of mute witness,",
    "Abandoning everything for the sake",
    "Of an unimaginable goodness",
    "Making its way across the crowded stage",
    "Of what might have been, leaving in its wake",
    "The anxiety of an empty page.",
    "Thought abhors a vacuum. Out of it came",
    "A partially recognizable shape",
    "Stumbling across a wilderness, whose name,",
    "Obscure at first, was sooner or later",
    "Sure to be revealed, and a landscape",
    "Of imaginary rocks and water",
    "And the dull pastels of the dimly lit",
    "Interior of a gymnasium.",
    "Is art the mirror of its opposite,",
    "Or is the world itself a mimesis?",
    "This afternoon at the symposium",
    "Someone tried to resurrect the thesis",
    "That a poem is a deflected sigh.",
    "And I remembered a day on a beach",
    "Thirty-five years ago, in mid-July,",
    "The summer before I left for college,",
    "With the future hanging just out of reach",
    "And constantly receding, like the edge",
    "Of the water floating across the sand.",
    "Poems are the fruit of the evasions",
    "Of a life spent trying to understand",
    "The vacuum at the center of the heart,",
    "And for all the intricate persuasions",
    "They enlist in the service of their art,",
    "Are finally small, disappointing things.",
    "Yet from them there materializes",
    "A way of life, a way of life that brings",
    "The fleeting pleasures of a vocation",
    "Made up of these constant exercises",
    "In what still passes for celebration,",
    "That began in a mood of hopelessness",
    "On an evening in a dormitory",
    "Years and years ago, and seemed to promise",
    "A respite from disquietude and care,",
    "But that left only the lovely story",
    "Of a bright presence hanging in the air."
