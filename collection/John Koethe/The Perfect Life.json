    "I have a perfect life. It isn't much,",
    "But it's enough for me. It keeps me alive",
    "And happy in a vague way: no disappointments",
    "On the near horizon, no pangs of doubt;",
    "Looking forward in anticipation, looking back",
    "In satisfaction at the conclusion of each day.",
    "I heed the promptings of my inner voice,",
    "And what I hear is comforting, full of reassurance",
    "For my own powers and innate superiority\u2014the fake",
    "Security of someone in the grip of a delusion,",
    "In denial, climbing ever taller towers",
    "Like a tiny tyrant looking on his little kingdom",
    "With a secret smile, while all the while",
    "Time lies in wait. And what feels ample now",
    "Turns colorless and cold, and what seems beautiful",
    "And strong becomes an object of indifference",
    "Reaching out to no one, as later middle age",
    "Turns old, and the strength is gone.",
    "Right now the moments yield to me sweet",
    "Feelings of contentment, but the human",
    "Dies, and what I take for granted bears a name",
    "To be forgotten soon, as the things I know",
    "Turn into unfamiliar faces",
    "In a strange room, leaving merely",
    "A blank space, like a hole left in the wake",
    "Of a perfect life, which closes over."
