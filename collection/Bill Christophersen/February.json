    "The cold grows colder, even as the days",
    "grow longer, February's mercury vapor light",
    "buffing but not defrosting the bone-white",
    "ground, crusty and treacherous underfoot.",
    "This is the time of year that's apt to put",
    "a hammerlock on a healthy appetite,",
    "old anxieties back into the night,",
    "insomnia and nightmares into play;",
    "when things in need of doing go undone",
    "and things that can't be undone come to call,",
    "muttering recriminations at the door,",
    "and buried ambitions rise up through the floor",
    "and pin your wriggling shoulders to the wall;",
    "and hope's a reptile waiting for the sun."
