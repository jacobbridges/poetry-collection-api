    "For ten days now, two luna moths remain",
    "silk-winged and lavish as a double broach",
    "pinned beneath the porch light of my cabin.",
    "Two of them, patinaed that sea-glass green",
    "of copper weather vanes nosing the wind,",
    "the sun-lit green of rockweed, the lichen\u2019s",
    "green scabbing-over of the bouldered shore,",
    "the plush green peat that carpets the island,",
    "that hushes, sinks then holds a boot print",
    "for days, and the sapling-green of new pines",
    "sprouting through it. The miraculous green",
    "origami of their wings\u2014false eyed, doomed",
    "and sensual as the mermaid\u2019s long green fins:",
    "a green siren calling from the moonlight.",
    "A green siren calling from the moonlight,",
    "from the sweet gum leaves and paper birches",
    "that shed, like tiny white decrees, scrolled bark.",
    "They emerge from cocoons like greased hinges,",
    "all pheromone and wing, instinct and flutter.",
    "They rise, hardwired, driven, through the creaking",
    "pine branches tufted with beard moss and fog.",
    "Two luna moths flitting like exotic birds",
    "towards only each other and light, in these",
    "their final few days, they mate, then starving",
    "they wait, inches apart, on my cabin wall",
    "to die, to share fully each pure and burning",
    "moment. They are, like desire itself, born",
    "without mouths. What, if not this, is love?"
