    "Because you died, I shall not rest again,",
    "But wander ever through the lone world wide,",
    "Seeking the shadow of a dream grown vain",
    "Because you died.",
    "I shall spend brief and idle hours beside",
    "The many lesser loves that still remain,",
    "But find in none my triumph and my pride;",
    "And Disillusion's slow corroding stain",
    "Will creep upon each quest but newly tried,",
    "For every striving now shall nothing gain",
    "Because you died."
