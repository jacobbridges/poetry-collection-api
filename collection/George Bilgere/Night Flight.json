    "I am doing laps at night, alone",
    "In the indoor pool. Outside",
    "It is snowing, but I am warm",
    "And weightless, suspended and out",
    "Of time like a fly in amber.",
    "She is thousands of miles",
    "From here, and miles above me,",
    "Ghosting the stratosphere,",
    "Heading from New York to London.",
    "Though it is late, even",
    "At that height, I know her light",
    "Is on, her window a square",
    "Of gold as she reads mysteries",
    "Above the Atlantic. I watch",
    "The line of black tile on the pool\u2019s",
    "Floor, leading me down the lane.",
    "If she looks down by moonlight,",
    "Under a clear sky, she will see",
    "Black water. She will see me",
    "Swimming distantly, moving far",
    "From shore, suspended with her",
    "In flight through the wide gulf",
    "As we swim toward land together."
