    "One evening in winter",
    "when nothing has been enough,",
    "when the days are too short,",
    "the nights too long",
    "and cheerless, the secret",
    "and docile buds of the apple",
    "blossoms begin their quick",
    "ascent to light. Night",
    "after interminable night",
    "the sugars pucker and swell",
    "into green slips, green",
    "silks. And just as you find",
    "yourself at the end",
    "of winter\u2019s long, cold",
    "rope, the blossoms open",
    "like pink thimbles",
    "and that black dollop",
    "of shine called",
    "bumblebee stumbles in."
