    "It is not poetry you fear, but poets,",
    "their indelible brand",
    "of words. How will your daughter",
    "escape the mark men hanged",
    "young women for in Salem?",
    "I am nothing more than a teacher,",
    "like you. See, I have removed",
    "my shoes and socks. I am rolling",
    "my trousers above my ankles.",
    "No cloven hooves. Long feet and toes",
    "like you and your beautiful daughter.",
    "It is language that has won",
    "her over, earth-bound words",
    "walking orderly across the page",
    "like children holding to",
    "the rope attached to your wrist,",
    "teacher and students",
    "traversing the noisy street",
    "at the crosswalk, with the light",
    "of your fingers composing",
    "the line your children read,",
    "each syllable's afterimage trailing",
    "your quick passage of hands",
    "conducting the boys and girls",
    "safely from one curb to the other."
