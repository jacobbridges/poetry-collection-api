    "Whether on the boulevard or gravel backroad,",
    "I do not easily raise my hand to those who toss",
    "up theirs in anonymous hello, merely to say",
    "\u201cI\u2019m passing this way.\u201d Once out of shyness, now",
    "reluctance to tip my hand, I admire the shrubbery",
    "instead. I\u2019ve learned where the lines are drawn",
    "and keep the privet well trimmed. I left one house",
    "with toys on the floor for another with quiet rugs",
    "and a bed where the moon comes in. I\u2019ve thrown",
    "myself at men in black turtlenecks only to find",
    "that home is best after all. Home where I sit",
    "in the glider, knowing it needs oil, like my own",
    "rusty joints. Where I coax blackberry to dogwood",
    "and winter to harvest, where my table is clothed",
    "in light. Home where I walk out on the thin page",
    "of night, without waving or giving myself away,",
    "and return with my words burning like fire in the grate."
