    "My mother sends the baby pictures she promised\u2014",
    "egg hunting in Shelby Park, wooden blocks",
    "and Thumbelina tossed on the rug, knotty pine",
    "walls in a house lost to memory. I separate out",
    "the early ones, studying my navel or crumbs",
    "on the tray, taken before my awareness",
    "of Sylvania Superflash. Here I am sitting",
    "on the dinette table, the near birthday cake",
    "striking me dumb. Two places of wedding china,",
    "two glasses of milk, posed for the marvelous",
    "moment: the child squishes the fluted rosettes,",
    "mother claps her hands, father snaps the picture",
    "in the face of time. When the sticky sweet",
    "is washed off the page, we are pasted in an album",
    "of blessed amnesia. The father leaves the pine house",
    "and sees the child on weekends, the mother",
    "stores the china on the top shelf until it\u2019s dull and crazed,",
    "the saucer-eyed girl grips her curved spoon",
    "like there\u2019s no tomorrow."
