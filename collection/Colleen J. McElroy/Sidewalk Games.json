    "I",
    "The sidewalks were long where I grew up.",
    "They were as veined as the backs",
    "Of my Grandma\u2019s hands.",
    "We knew every inch of pavement;",
    "We jumped the cracks",
    "Chanting rhymes that broke evil spirits,",
    "Played tag at sunset",
    "Among the fireflies and sweet maple trees",
    "Or sang wishful sonnets about boyfriends",
    "To the tune of whipping jump ropes.",
    "The sidewalks wrapped around corners",
    "Like dirty ribbons lacing the old houses",
    "Together in tight knots;",
    "Maple trees bordered",
    "The all-white cemetery.",
    "Sometimes we\u2019d watch Priscilla\u2019s uncle",
    "Sway down the dirt alley towards home.",
    "We called her Pussy, called him",
    "Crazy Max.",
    "He was feebleminded and took to fits,",
    "Barely making it from alley to pavement,",
    "Loping down the street like a drunk.",
    "We paced his jagged walk",
    "Against tumbling tunes,",
    "Taunting each pigeon-toed footstep",
    "With rhyme.",
    "The boys bolder, louder",
    "The girls tagging along",
    "Braids flopping like twisted hemp,",
    "Ending in brightly colored ribbons.",
    "We turned our black faces into silence",
    "When he finally made it home;",
    "Watched him grope up the broken concrete stairs,",
    "Clutch the wooden railing,",
    "Lunge for the broken screen door",
    "And his medicine.",
    "His tongue flopped wildly,",
    "Parrot noises drowning his sister\u2019s cries",
    "As she rushed from the black pit",
    "Of their house.",
    "One day, he leaned away from the safe umbrella",
    "Of his sister\u2019s voice;",
    "Leaned into the sky,",
    "Hanging on the porch rail like a rag doll,",
    "Then fell into the cracks of the sidewalk.",
    "We rarely chanted after that,",
    "Always passed Pussy\u2019s house in silence.",
    "Sometimes I\u2019d sit in the sweet stillness",
    "Of Grandma\u2019s moldy basement",
    "And draw his outline on the wet fuzzy walls.",
    "The grey concrete backdropped my stick figure",
    "As it fell into nothingness.",
    "II",
    "Bumpsy played the Dirty Dozens",
    "As we jackknifed the length of the block,",
    "Forcing grown-ups off the street.",
    "We linked arms like soldiers,",
    "Our black legs scissoring in precision.",
    "One\u2019s a company, two\u2019s a crowd",
    "Three on the sidewalk is not allowed\u2014",
    "Last night, the night before",
    "Twenty-four robbers at my door\u2014",
    "Po-lice, po-lice, do your duty",
    "Make this boy stop feeling my booty\u2014",
    "Mary, Mary, tell me true",
    "Who is the one you love?",
    "Tin soldiers, wooden guns, and sharp tongues.",
    "We got comic books for the price of one",
    "In blitz attacks at Old Man Farrow\u2019s dirty store.",
    "Garages were secret places for dirty jokes,",
    "Our folks couldn\u2019t afford cars.",
    "When we got older, we played house for real",
    "Until we found Terry\u2019s baby sister\u2019s body",
    "Behind a stack of tires;",
    "The melodies we\u2019d sung still seemed to bounce",
    "Off the dirty walls and stacks of comic books.",
    "III",
    "Our houses ended at the sidewalk,",
    "Whitewashed steps gleaming like teeth",
    "Against the blocks of grey pavement.",
    "We walked three blocks just to find",
    "A vacant lot to feed Mildred\u2019s thirst",
    "For green grass.",
    "Fat Vaughn could eat a whole sheet",
    "Of newspaper in less than three minutes.",
    "Once, I licked the damp cellar wall,",
    "But the taste didn\u2019t match the sweet smell.",
    "Ten years later, I searched through Grandma\u2019s",
    "Things before they were sold for auction.",
    "I found her picture, three comics and the wind-up",
    "Victrola we had used to put on our version",
    "Of Cotton Club musicals.",
    "We traded days so we could all be stars;",
    "The rest sang chorus until the Victrola",
    "Ran out of steam, the record moaning",
    "Like a sick calf.",
    "I found the stack of old pillows",
    "We collapsed on, giggling and tumbling",
    "Against each other like puppies,",
    "While the needle stuck in one groove",
    "Cutting circles in the records."
