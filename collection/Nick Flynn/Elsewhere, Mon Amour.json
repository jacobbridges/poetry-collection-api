    "Leaning from the platform, waiting for a glimmer",
    "to braid the rails",
    "the eyes of the action hero cut from the poster",
    "all that concrete pressing down",
    "A fine edge gleams around your body",
    "as if it could be contained",
    "The way each finger is licked, dipped in &",
    "rubbed across the gums",
    "until the teeth go away",
    "Even my hands kiss you",
    "A night broken down into grains",
    "If you find yourself lost, dig",
    "a cave in the snow, quickly",
    "you need shelter against the night",
    "A candle could keep you alive",
    "the engine of your lungs",
    "will heat the air around you, someone will",
    "miss you, they will send out dogs",
    "You must be somewhere, right?"
