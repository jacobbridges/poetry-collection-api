    "And here face down beneath the sun",
    "And here upon earth\u2019s noonward height",
    "To feel the always coming on",
    "The always rising of the night:",
    "To feel creep up the curving east",
    "The earthy chill of dusk and slow",
    "Upon those under lands the vast",
    "And ever climbing shadow grow",
    "And strange at Ecbatan the trees",
    "Take leaf by leaf the evening strange",
    "The flooding dark about their knees",
    "The mountains over Persia change",
    "And now at Kermanshah the gate",
    "Dark empty and the withered grass",
    "And through the twilight now the late",
    "Few travelers in the westward pass",
    "And Baghdad darken and the bridge",
    "Across the silent river gone",
    "And through Arabia the edge",
    "Of evening widen and steal on",
    "And deepen on Palmyra\u2019s street",
    "The wheel rut in the ruined stone",
    "And Lebanon fade out and Crete",
    "High through the clouds and overblown",
    "And over Sicily the air",
    "Still flashing with the landward gulls",
    "And loom and slowly disappear",
    "The sails above the shadowy hulls",
    "And Spain go under and the shore",
    "Of Africa the gilded sand",
    "And evening vanish and no more",
    "The low pale light across that land",
    "Nor now the long light on the sea:",
    "And here face downward in the sun",
    "To feel how swift how secretly",
    "The shadow of the night comes on ..."
