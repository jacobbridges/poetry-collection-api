    "I speak this poem now with grave and level voice",
    "In praise of autumn, of the far-horn-winding fall.",
    "I praise the flower-barren fields, the clouds, the tall",
    "Unanswering branches where the wind makes sullen noise.",
    "I praise the fall: it is the human season.",
    "Now",
    "No more the foreign sun does meddle at our earth,",
    "Enforce the green and bring the fallow land to birth,",
    "Nor winter yet weigh all with silence the pine bough,",
    "But now in autumn with the black and outcast crows",
    "Share we the spacious world: the whispering year is gone:",
    "There is more room to live now: the once secret dawn",
    "Comes late by daylight and the dark unguarded goes.",
    "Between the mutinous brave burning of the leaves",
    "And winter\u2019s covering of our hearts with his deep snow",
    "We are alone: there are no evening birds: we know",
    "The naked moon: the tame stars circle at our eaves.",
    "It is the human season. On this sterile air",
    "Do words outcarry breath: the sound goes on and on.",
    "I hear a dead man\u2019s cry from autumn long since gone.",
    "I cry to you beyond upon this bitter air."
