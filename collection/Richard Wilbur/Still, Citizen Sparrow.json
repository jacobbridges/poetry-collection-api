    "Still, citizen sparrow, this vulture which you call",
    "Unnatural, let him but lumber again to air",
    "Over the rotten office, let him bear",
    "The carrion ballast up, and at the tall",
    "Tip of the sky lie cruising. Then you\u2019ll see",
    "That no more beautiful bird is in heaven\u2019s height,",
    "No wider more placid wings, no watchfuller flight;",
    "He shoulders nature there, the frightfully free,",
    "The naked-headed one. Pardon him, you",
    "Who dart in the orchard aisles, for it is he",
    "Devours death, mocks mutability,",
    "Has heart to make an end, keeps nature new.",
    "Thinking of Noah, childheart, try to forget",
    "How for so many bedlam hours his saw",
    "Soured the song of birds with its wheezy gnaw,",
    "And the slam of his hammer all the day beset",
    "The people\u2019s ears. Forget that he could bear",
    "To see the towns like coral under the keel,",
    "And the fields so dismal deep. Try rather to feel",
    "How high and weary it was, on the waters where",
    "He rocked his only world, and everyone\u2019s.",
    "Forgive the hero, you who would have died",
    "Gladly with all you knew; he rode that tide",
    "To Ararat; all men are Noah\u2019s sons."
