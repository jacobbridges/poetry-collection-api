    "The eyes open to a cry of pulleys,",
    "And spirited from sleep, the astounded soul",
    "Hangs for a moment bodiless and simple",
    "As false dawn.",
    "Outside the open window",
    "The morning air is all awash with angels.",
    "Some are in bed-sheets, some are in blouses,",
    "Some are in smocks: but truly there they are.",
    "Now they are rising together in calm swells",
    "Of halcyon feeling, filling whatever they wear",
    "With the deep joy of their impersonal breathing;",
    "Now they are flying in place, conveying",
    "The terrible speed of their omnipresence, moving",
    "And staying like white water; and now of a sudden",
    "They swoon down into so rapt a quiet",
    "That nobody seems to be there.",
    "The soul shrinks",
    "From all that it is about to remember,",
    "From the punctual rape of every bless\u00e8d day,",
    "And cries,",
    "\u201cOh, let there be nothing on earth but laundry,",
    "Nothing but rosy hands in the rising steam",
    "And clear dances done in the sight of heaven.\u201d",
    "Yet, as the sun acknowledges",
    "With a warm look the world\u2019s hunks and colors,",
    "The soul descends once more in bitter love",
    "To accept the waking body, saying now",
    "In a changed voice as the man yawns and rises,",
    "\u201cBring them down from their ruddy gallows;",
    "Let there be clean linen for the backs of thieves;",
    "Let lovers go fresh and sweet to be undone,",
    "And the heaviest nuns walk in a pure floating",
    "Of dark habits,",
    "keeping their difficult balance.\u201d"
