    "To cure myself of wanting Cuban songs,",
    "I wrote a Cuban song about the need",
    "For people to suppress their fantasies,",
    "Especially unhealthy ones. The song",
    "Began by making reference to the sea,",
    "Because the sea is like a need so great",
    "And deep it never can be swallowed. Then",
    "The song explores some common myths",
    "But the Cuban people and their folklore:",
    "The story of a little Carib boy",
    "Mistakenly abandoned to the sea;",
    "The legend of a bird who wanted song",
    "So desperately he gave up flight; a queen",
    "Whose strength was greater than a rival king\u2019s.",
    "The song goes on about morality,",
    "And then there is a line about the sea,",
    "How deep it is, how many creatures need",
    "Its nourishment, how beautiful it is",
    "To need. The song is ending now, because",
    "I cannot bear to hear it any longer.",
    "I call this song of needful love my voice."
