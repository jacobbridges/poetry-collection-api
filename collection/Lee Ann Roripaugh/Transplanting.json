    "1.",
    "My mother carried the chest x-ray",
    "in her lap on the plane, inside",
    "a manila envelope that read",
    "and, garnished",
    "with leis at the Honolulu Airport,",
    "waited in line\u2014this strange image",
    "of ribcage, chain-link vertebrae,",
    "pearled milk of lung, and the murky",
    "enigmatic chambers of her heart",
    "in hand. Until it was her turn",
    "and the immigration officer held",
    "the black-and-white film up",
    "to sun, light pierced clean through",
    "her, and she was ushered from one",
    "life through the gate of another,",
    "wreathed in the dubious and illusory",
    "perfume of plucked orchids.",
    "2.",
    "Newly arrived in New Mexico,",
    "stiff and crisp in new dungarees,",
    "her honeymoon, they drove",
    "into the mountains in a borrowed car,",
    "spiraling up and up toward the rumor",
    "of deer, into the green tangy turpentine",
    "scent of pine, where air crackled",
    "with the sizzling collision of bees,",
    "furred legs grappling velvet bodies",
    "as they mated midair, and where",
    "they came upon the disconsolate gaze",
    "of a Madonna alcoved against",
    "the side of the road, her feet wreathed",
    "in candles, fruit, flowers, and other",
    "offerings. Nearby, a vendor",
    "with a wooden plank balanced between",
    "two folding chairs and the glossy",
    "row of ceramic pigs lined up across,",
    "brilliant glaze shimmering the heat.",
    "My mother fell in love with the red-",
    "and-blue splash of flowers tattooed",
    "into fat flanks and bellies, the green",
    "arabesques of stem and leaf circling",
    "hoof, snout, and ear.",
    ".",
    "Years later she still describes the pig",
    "with a sigh\u2014",
    ", the word",
    "she chooses with careful consideration.",
    "She\u2019d filled the pig with Kennedy dollars",
    "from the grocery budget, each half dollar",
    "a small luxury denied at the local",
    "Piggly Wiggly, until one day, jingling",
    "the shift and clink of the pig\u2019s",
    "growing silver weight, she shook",
    "too hard, and as if the hoarded wealth",
    "of her future were too much to contain,",
    "the pig broke open\u2014spilling coins",
    "like water, a cold shiny music, into her lap\u2014",
    "fragments of bright pottery shards",
    "scattering delicate as Easter eggshell.",
    "3.",
    "My mother sneezes in Japanese.",
    "An exclamation of surprise\u2014two sharp",
    "crisp syllables before pulling out",
    "the neatly folded and quartered tissue",
    "she keeps tucked inside the wrist",
    "of her sweater sleeve. Sometimes,",
    "when ragweed blooms, I wonder why",
    "her sneeze isn\u2019t mine, why something",
    "so involuntary, so deeply rooted",
    "in the seed of speech, breaks free from",
    "my mouth like thistle in a stiff breeze,",
    "in a language other than my mother\u2019s",
    "tongue. How do you chart the diaspora",
    "of a sneeze?",
    "you turned out this way, she always",
    "tells me, and I think that we are each",
    "her own moon\u2014one face in shadow,",
    "undisclosed seas and surprising mountains,",
    "rotating in the circular music",
    "of separate spheres, but held in orbit",
    "by the gravitational muscle",
    "of the same mercurial spinning heart.",
    "4.",
    "There is an art to this. To shish",
    "kebab the varnished pit of avocado",
    "on three toothpicks above a pickle jar",
    "of cool water, tease down the pale",
    "thirsty hairs of root until one sinewy",
    "arm punches up and unclenches its green",
    "fisted hand, palm open, to the sun.",
    "To discern the oniony star-struck",
    "subterfuge of bulbs, their perverse",
    "desires, death-like sleeps, and conspire",
    "behind the scenes to embroider",
    "the Elizabethan ruffles and festoons",
    "of their flamboyant resurrections.",
    "To trick the tomatoes into letting down",
    "their swelling, tumescent orbs",
    "in the cottony baked heat of the attic",
    "until their sunburnt faces glow",
    "like round orange lanterns under",
    "the crepuscular twilight of the eaves.",
    "Unwrapping the cuttings of succulents",
    "from their moist, paper-towel bandages,",
    "and snugging them down into firm",
    "dimples of dirt and peat, coaxing up",
    "the apple-green serpentine coils of sweet",
    "pea with a snake charmer\u2019s song to wind",
    "around the trellis and flicker their quick",
    "pink-petaled tongues. The tender slips",
    "of mint, sueded upturned bells of petunia,",
    "and slim fingers of pine that pluck",
    "the metal window screen like a tin harp",
    "by the breakfast nook where my father",
    "stirs his morning coffee and waits",
    "for the neighbors\u2019 Dalmatian to hurl",
    "itself over the back fence and hang,",
    "limply twisting and gasping on the end",
    "of its chain and collar like a polka-dotted",
    "petticoat, until my father goes outside",
    "and takes its baleful kicking weight",
    "in his arms and gently tosses it back",
    "over the fence into the neighbors\u2019 yard.",
    "Year after year, the dandelions",
    "and clover are weeded out, summers",
    "come and go, and roots stubbornly inch",
    "down around the foundation of the house\u2014",
    "labyrinthine, powerful and deep.",
    "5.",
    "She was given an apple on the plane,",
    "round and fragrant with the scent",
    "of her grandfather\u2019s fruit orchards",
    "during autumn, when chestnuts",
    "dropped from their trees and struck",
    "the metal rooftop like the small heavy",
    "tongues of bells, and black dragon-",
    "flies like quick shiny needles darted",
    "in and out of the spin and turn",
    "of leaves fluttering down like soft",
    "bright scraps of silk. She wrapped",
    "the apple in a napkin to save",
    "for later, and it was confiscated",
    "at customs before she had the chance",
    "for even a taste. Over the years it",
    "seemed to grow larger, yellower, juicier",
    "and more delicious, and even though",
    "there were burnished rows of apples",
    "stacked in gleaming pyramids",
    "at the supermarket with quaint",
    "names like Macintosh, Winesap,",
    "and Granny Smith, and even though",
    "there were sunlit apple orchards",
    "at my American grandfather\u2019s ranch,",
    "where rattlesnakes slumbered",
    "in the heat and redolence of fruit",
    "flesh, frightening the horses,",
    "she sampled one after another,",
    "but they never tasted as sweet",
    "or as bright as the apple taken from her,",
    "the one she had to leave behind."
