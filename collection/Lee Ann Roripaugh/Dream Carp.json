    "People traveled from miles away to see",
    "my paintings of fish\u2014",
    "the jeweled armor of their scales, the beadlike",
    "set of their eyes in",
    "rubbery socket rings, the glimmering",
    "swish of fin and tail",
    "so real it seemed that you could almost dip",
    "a net deep into",
    "the paper and pull up the arching wet",
    "weight of a golden carp,",
    "a shiny trout, or the dark muscular",
    "heft of a bass with",
    "its mouth stretched into the surprised, wiry",
    "\u201coh\u201d of a child\u2019s wind",
    "sock. I captured my models from the sea,",
    "lake, and goldfish pond",
    "in the back garden, so careful not to",
    "let their mouths be torn",
    "by the hook, their scales chipped, or the silky",
    "tissue of their tails",
    "ripped by a clumsy hand. I kept them in",
    "large glass bowls, fed them",
    "mosquito wings or dry silkworm pupas",
    "offered from chopsticks,",
    "and when I was finished making sketches,",
    "I quickly took them",
    "back and set them free again. Every",
    "night I dream I swim",
    "with these fish as a golden carp\u2014black spots",
    "on cloisonn\u00e9 scales,",
    "pulled to the surface by the deceptive",
    "creamy luster of",
    "the moon or the sizzle of firefly lights",
    "across the water.",
    "And every night I am tempted once",
    "again by the smell",
    "of the baited hook, by my predictable",
    "hunger for earthly",
    "things, and each time I am surprised again",
    "by the stinging hook",
    "in my lip that pulls me mercilessly",
    "into the bright air,",
    "setting my gills on fire, the sharp, silver",
    "pain of the knife that",
    "slits me open so easily from tail",
    "to throat to reveal",
    "the scarlet elastic of my raw gills,",
    "the translucent film",
    "of my air sac, the milky rise of my",
    "stomach, and the gray",
    "marbled coil of my intestines. I rise",
    "late each day, and work",
    "in brighter light. When I die, I will",
    "have my paintings brought",
    "down to the lake and slipped into the water.",
    "First the edges of",
    "ink will blur, and then there will be a great",
    "flurry as the fins,",
    "tails, and bodies begin blossoming in-",
    "to life again, each",
    "fish detaching from its canvas of silk",
    "or rice paper\u2014a",
    "swirl of color, motion, swimming away."
