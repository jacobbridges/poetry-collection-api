    "In the sad November time,",
    "When the leaf has left the lime,",
    "And the Cam, with sludge and slime,",
    "Plasters his ugly channel,",
    "While, with sober step and slow,",
    "Round about the marshes low,",
    "Stiffening students stumping go",
    "Shivering through their flannel.",
    "Then to me in doleful mood",
    "Rises up a question rude,",
    "Asking what sufficient good",
    "Comes of this mode of living?",
    "Moping on from day to day,",
    "Grinding up what will not \u201cpay,\u201d",
    "Till the jaded brain gives way",
    "Under its own misgiving.",
    "Why should wretched Man employ",
    "Years which Nature meant for joy,",
    "Striving vainly to destroy",
    "Freedom of thought and feeling?",
    "Still the injured powers remain",
    "Endless stores of hopeless pain,",
    "When at last the vanquished brain",
    "Languishes past all healing.",
    "Where is then his wealth of mind\u2014",
    "All the schemes that Hope designed?",
    "Gone, like spring, to leave behind",
    "Indolent melancholy.",
    "Thus he ends his helpless days,",
    "Vex\u2019t with thoughts of former praise\u2014",
    "Tell me, how are Wisdom\u2019s ways",
    "Better than senseless Folly?",
    "Happier those whom trifles please,",
    "Dreaming out a life of ease,",
    "Sinking by unfelt degrees",
    "Into annihilation.",
    "Or the slave, to labour born,",
    "Heedless of the freeman\u2019s scorn,",
    "Destined to be slowly worn",
    "Down to the brute creation.",
    "Thus a tempting spirit spoke,",
    "As from troubled sleep I woke",
    "To a morning thick with smoke,",
    "Sunless and damp and chilly.",
    "Then to sleep I turned once more,",
    "Eyes inflamed and windpipe sore,",
    "Dreaming dreams I dreamt before,",
    "Only not quite so silly.",
    "In my dream methought I strayed",
    "Where a learned-looking maid",
    "Stores of flimsy goods displayed,",
    "Articles not worth wearing.",
    "\u201cThese,\u201d she said, with solemn air,",
    "\u201cAre the robes that sages wear,",
    "Warranted, when kept with care,",
    "Never to need repairing.\u201d",
    "Then unnumbered witlings, caught",
    "By her wiles, the trappings bought,",
    "And by labour, not by thought,",
    "Honour and fame were earning.",
    "While the men of wiser mind",
    "Passed for blind among the blind;",
    "Pedants left them far behind",
    "In the career of learning.",
    "\u201cThose that fix their eager eyes",
    "Ever on the nearest prize",
    "Well may venture to despise",
    "Loftier aspirations.",
    "Pedantry is in demand!",
    "Buy it up at second-hand,",
    "Seek no more to understand",
    "Profitless speculations.\u201d",
    "Thus the gaudy gowns were sold,",
    "Cast off sloughs of pedants old;",
    "Proudly marched the students bold",
    "Through the domain of error,",
    "Till their trappings, false though fair,",
    "Mouldered off and left them bare,",
    "Clustering close in blank despair,",
    "Nakedness, cold, and terror.",
    "Then, I said, \u201cThese haughty Schools",
    "Boast that by their formal rules",
    "They produce more learned fools",
    "Than could be well expected.",
    "Learned fools they are indeed,",
    "Learned in the books they read;",
    "Fools whene\u2019er they come to need",
    "Wisdom, too long neglected.",
    "\u201cOh! that men indeed were wise,",
    "And would raise their purblind eyes",
    "To the opening mysteries",
    "Scattered around them ever.",
    "Truth should spring from sterile ground,",
    "Beauty beam from all around,",
    "Right should then at last be found",
    "Joining what none may sever.\u201d"
