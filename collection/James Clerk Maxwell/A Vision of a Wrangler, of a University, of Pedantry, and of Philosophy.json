    "Ever made the slightest use.",
    "Late to bed and early rising,",
    "Ever luxury despising,",
    "Ever training, never \u201csizing,\u201d",
    "I have suffered with the rest.",
    "Yellow cheek and forehead ruddy,",
    "Memory confused and muddy,",
    "These are the effects of study",
    "Of a subject so unblest.",

    "If you had them you would hate your",
    "Symbolising sense of sight.",
    "Seeing planets in their courses",
    "Thick beset with arrowy \u201cforces,\u201d",

    "Than when free\u2019d from every fetter",
    "That the uninforming letter",
    "Rivets on the tortured mind,",
    "Man, with silent admiration",
    "Sees the glories of Creation,",
    "And, in holy contemplation,",
    "Leaves the learned crowd behind!"
