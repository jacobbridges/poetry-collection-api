    "We\u2019re all dreamers; we don\u2019t know who we are.",
    "Some machine made us; machine of the world, the constricting family.",
    "Then back to the world, polished by soft whips.",
    "We dream; we don\u2019t remember.",
    "Machine of the family: dark fur, forests of the mother\u2019s body.",
    "Machine of the mother: white city inside her.",
    "And before that: earth and water.",
    "Moss between rocks, pieces of leaves and grass.",
    "And before, cells in a great darkness.",
    "And before that, the veiled world.",
    "This is why you were born: to silence me.",
    "Cells of my mother and father, it is your turn",
    "to be pivotal, to be the masterpiece.",
    "I improvised; I never remembered.",
    "Now it\u2019s your turn to be driven;",
    "you\u2019re the one who demands to know:",
    "Why do I suffer? Why am I ignorant?",
    "Cells in a great darkness. Some machine made us;",
    "it is your turn to address it, to go back asking",
    "what am I for? What am I for?"
