    "twelve weeks of summer. All this",
    "belongs to you: on the other hand,",
    "I planted the seeds, I watched the first shoots",
    "like wings tearing the soil, and it was my heart",

    "between the dead and the living, who are, in consequence,",
    "immune to foreshadowing, you may not know",
    "how much terror we bear, the spotted leaf,",
    "the red leaves of the maple falling",
    "even in August, in early darkness: I am responsible",
    "for these vines."
