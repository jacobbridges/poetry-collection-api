    "On a small lake off",
    "the map of the world, two",
    "swans lived. As swans,",
    "they spent eighty percent of the day studying",
    "themselves in the attentive water and",
    "twenty percent ministering to the beloved",
    "other. Thus",
    "their fame as lovers stems",
    "chiefly from narcissism, which leaves",
    "so little leisure for",
    "more general cruising. But",
    "fate had other plans: after ten years, they hit",
    "slimy water; whatever the filth was, it",
    "clung to the male\u2019s plumage, which turned",
    "instantly gray; simultaneously,",
    "the true purpose of his neck\u2019s",
    "flexible design revealed itself. So much",
    "action on the flat lake, so much",
    "he\u2019s missed! Sooner or later in a long",
    "life together, every couple encounters",
    "some emergency like this, some",
    "drama which results",
    "in harm. This",
    "occurs for a reason: to test",
    "love and to demand",
    "fresh articulation of its complex terms.",
    "So it came to light that the male and female",
    "flew under different banners: whereas",
    "the male believed that love",
    "was what one felt in one\u2019s heart",
    "the female believed",
    "love was what one did. But this is not",
    "a little story about the male\u2019s",
    "inherent corruption, using as evidence the swan\u2019s",
    "sleazy definition of purity. It is",
    "a story of guile and innocence. For ten years",
    "the female studied the male; she dallied",
    "when he slept or when he was",
    "conveniently absorbed in the water,",
    "while the spontaneous male",
    "acted casually, on",
    "the whim of the moment. On the muddy water",
    "they bickered awhile, in the fading light,",
    "until the bickering grew",
    "slowly abstract, becoming",
    "part of their song",
    "after a little longer."
