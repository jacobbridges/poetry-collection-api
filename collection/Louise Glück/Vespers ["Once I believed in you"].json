    "Once I believed in you; I planted a fig tree.",
    "Here, in Vermont, country",
    "of no summer. It was a test: if the tree lived,",
    "it would mean you existed.",
    "By this logic, you do not exist. Or you exist",
    "exclusively in warmer climates,",
    "in fervent Sicily and Mexico and California,",
    "where are grown the unimaginable",
    "apricot and fragile peach. Perhaps",
    "they see your face in Sicily; here we barely see",
    "the hem of your garment. I have to discipline myself",
    "to share with John and Noah the tomato crop.",
    "If there is justice in some other world, those",
    "like myself, whom nature forces",
    "into lives of abstinence, should get",
    "the lion's share of all things, all",
    "objects of hunger, greed being",
    "praise of you. And no one praises",
    "more intensely than I, with more",
    "painfully checked desire, or more deserves",
    "to sit at your right hand, if it exists, partaking",
    "of the perishable, the immortal fig,",
    "which does not travel."
