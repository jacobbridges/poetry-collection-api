    "Huge vapours brood above the clifted shore,",
    "Night o'er the ocean settles, dark and mute,",
    "Save where is heard the repercussive roar",
    "Of drowsy billows, on the rugged foot",
    "Of rocks remote; or still more distant tone",
    "Of seamen, in the anchored bark, that tell",
    "The watch relieved; or one deep voice alone,",
    "Singing the hour, and bidding \"strike the bell.\"",
    "All is black shadow, but the lucid line",
    "Marked by the light surf on the level sand,",
    "Or where afar, the ship-lights faintly shine",
    "Like wandering fairy fires, that oft on land",
    "Mislead the pilgrim; such the dubious ray",
    "That wavering reason lends, in life's long darkling way."
