    "Handsome, like those foam-topped tidal waves breaking high, in little crystal globes.",
    "Handsome, like the breeze that lifts a little tuft of tulle. If tulle were life.",
    "Handsome, like a frozen face, tear-tracked, when the sun hammers down.",
    "Handsome. Like fire.",
    "Handsome, like the bottomless sky, with that one proud penetrating star.",
    "But handsome, too, like a sky that\u2019s an arching ocean, and an earth prone as an ocean\u2019s floor.",
    "Handsome ocean-sky, and earth-sea floor.",
    "The big question is: where\u2019s the man in a scene like this?",
    "Handsome: the man asleep. And the night sky swarms, tropic and wide.",
    "Handsome, in some ornamental, muggy midnight caught between cat\u2019s paws. Sharp-nailed:",
    "they prick.",
    "Handsome: the firefly swarms around you.",
    "Handsome, like a soap bubble grazing a little black dress. Like a soap-bubble pricked with a pin.",
    "Handsomeness a rainbow, a rainbow an arrow, an arrow in my chest.",
    "Handsome, like shadows slow-rolling on a Japanese screen.",
    "Handsome motion.",
    "Handsome as life and poison.",
    "Sun-blood handsome. Bleeding sun."
