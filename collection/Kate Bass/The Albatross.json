    "When I know you are coming home",
    "I put on this necklace:",
    "glass beads on a silken thread,",
    "a blue that used to match my eyes.",
    "I like to think I am remembering you.",
    "I like to think you don\u2019t forget.",
    "The necklace lies heavy on my skin,",
    "it clatters when I reach down",
    "to lift my screaming child.",
    "I swing her, roll her in my arms until she forgets.",
    "The beads glitter in the flicker of a TV set",
    "as I sit her on my lap",
    "and wish away the afternoon.",
    "I wait until I hear a gate latch lift",
    "the turn of key in lock.",
    "I sit amongst toys and unwashed clothes,",
    "I sit and she fingers the beads until you speak",
    "in a voice that no longer seems familiar, only strange.",
    "I turn as our child tugs at the string.",
    "I hear a snap and a sound like falling rain."
