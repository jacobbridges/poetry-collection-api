    "I remember, I remember,",
    "The house where I was born,",
    "The little window where the sun",
    "Came peeping in at morn;",
    "He never came a wink too soon,",
    "Nor brought too long a day,",
    "But now, I often wish the night",
    "Had borne my breath away!",
    "I remember, I remember,",
    "The roses, red and white,",
    "The vi'lets, and the lily-cups,",
    "Those flowers made of light!",
    "The lilacs where the robin built,",
    "And where my brother set",
    "The laburnum on his birthday,\u2014",
    "The tree is living yet!",
    "I remember, I remember,",
    "Where I was used to swing,",
    "And thought the air must rush as fresh",
    "To swallows on the wing;",
    "My spirit flew in feathers then,",
    "That is so heavy now,",
    "And summer pools could hardly cool",
    "The fever on my brow!",
    "I remember, I remember,",
    "The fir trees dark and high;",
    "I used to think their slender tops",
    "Were close against the sky:",
    "It was a childish ignorance,",
    "But now 'tis little joy",
    "To know I'm farther off from heav'n",
    "Than when I was a boy."
