    "Tonight the bear",
    "comes to the orchard and, balancing",
    "on her hind legs, dances under the apple trees,",
    "hanging onto their boughs,",
    "dragging their branches down to earth.",
    "Look again. It is not the bear",
    "but some afterimage of her",
    "like the car I once saw in the driveway",
    "after the last guest had gone.",
    "Snow pulls the apple boughs to the ground.",
    "Whatever moves in the orchard\u2014",
    "heavy, lumbering\u2014is clear as wind.",
    "The bear is long gone.",
    "Drunk on apples,",
    "she banged over the trash cans that fall night,",
    "then skidded downstream. By now",
    "she must be logged in for the winter.",
    "Unless she is choosy.",
    "I imagine her as very choosy,",
    "sniffing at the huge logs, pawing them, trying",
    "each one on for size,",
    "but always coming out again.",
    "Until tonight.",
    "Tonight sap freezes under her skin.",
    "Her breath leaves white apples in the air.",
    "As she walks she dozes,",
    "listening to the sound of axes chopping wood.",
    "Somewhere she can never catch up to",
    "trees are falling. Chips pile up like snow",
    "When she does find it finally,",
    "the log draws her in as easily as a forest,",
    "and for a while she continues to see,",
    "just ahead of her, the moon",
    "trapped like a salmon in the ice."
