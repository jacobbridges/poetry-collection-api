    "The shock comes slowly",
    "as an afterthought.",
    "First you hear the words",
    "and they are like all other words,",
    "ordinary, breathing out of lips,",
    "moving toward you in a straight line.",
    "Later they shatter",
    "and rearrange themselves. They spell",
    "something else hidden in the muscles",
    "of the face, something the throat wanted to say.",
    "Decoded, the message etches itself in acid",
    "so every syllable becomes a sore.",
    "The shock blooms into a carbuncle.",
    "The body bends to accommodate it.",
    "A special scarf has to be worn to conceal it.",
    "It is now the size of a head.",
    "The next time you look,",
    "it has grown two eyes and a mouth.",
    "It is difficult to know which to use.",
    "Now you are seeing everything twice.",
    "After a while it becomes an old friend.",
    "It reminds you every day of how it came to be."
