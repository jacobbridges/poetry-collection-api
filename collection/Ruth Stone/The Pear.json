    "There hangs this bellied pear, let no rake doubt,",
    "Meat for the tongue and febrile to the skin,",
    "Wasting for the mildew and the rot,",
    "A tallow rump slow rounded, a pelt thin",
    "And for the quickest bite; so, orchard bred,",
    "Heaviest downward from the shaking stem.",
    "Whose fingers curve around the ripened head",
    "Lust to split so fine a diadem.",
    "There is the picker, stretches for the knife,",
    "There are the ravening who claw the fruit,",
    "More, those adjuring wax that lasts a life,",
    "And foxes, freak for cunning, after loot.",
    "For that sweet suck the hornet whines his wits,",
    "But husbandman will dry her for the pits."
