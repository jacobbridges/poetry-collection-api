    "Enclosure, steam-heated; a trial casket.",
    "You are here; your name on a postal box;",
    "entrance into another place like vapor.",
    "No one knows you. No one speaks to you.",
    "All of their cocks stare down their pant legs",
    "at the ground. Their cunts are blind. They",
    "barely let you through the check-out line.",
    "Have a nice day. Plastic or paper?",
    "Are you origami? A paper folded swan,",
    "like the ones you made when you were ten?",
    "When you saw the constellations, lying",
    "on your back in the wet grass,",
    "the soapy pear blossoms drifting",
    "and wasting, and those stars, the burned out ones",
    "whose light was still coming in waves;",
    "your body was too slight.",
    "How could it hold such mass?",
    "Still on your lips the taste of something.",
    "All night you waited for morning, all morning",
    "for afternoon, all afternoon for night;",
    "and still the longing sings.",
    "Oh, paper bird with folded wings."
