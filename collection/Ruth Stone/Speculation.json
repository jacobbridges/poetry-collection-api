    "In the coolness here I care",
    "Not for the down-pressed noises overhead,",
    "I hear in my pearly bone the wear",
    "Of marble under the rain; nothing is truly dead,",
    "There is only the wearing away,",
    "The changing of means. Nor eyes I have",
    "To tell how in the summer the mourning dove",
    "Rocks on the hemlock\u2019s arm, nor ears to rend",
    "The sad regretful mind",
    "With the call of the horned lark.",
    "I lie so still that the earth around me",
    "Shakes with the weight of day;",
    "I do not mind if the vase",
    "Holds decomposed cut flowers, or if they send",
    "One of their kind to tidy up. Such play",
    "I have no memories of,",
    "Nor of the fire-bush flowers, or the bark",
    "Of the rough pine where the crows",
    "With their great haw and flap",
    "Circle in kinned excitement when a wind blows.",
    "I am kin with none of these,",
    "Nor even wed to the yellowing silk that splits;",
    "My sensitive bones, which dreaded,",
    "As all the living do, the dead,",
    "Wait for some unappointed pattern. The wits",
    "Of countless centuries dry in my skull and overhead",
    "I do not heed the first rain out of winter,",
    "Nor do I care what they have planted. At my center",
    "The bone glistens; of wondrous bones I am made;",
    "And alone shine in a phosphorous glow,",
    "So, in this little plot where I am laid."
