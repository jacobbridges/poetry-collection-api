    "I went back, as to my relatives.",
    "When I arrived, the elms had been shaved.",
    "But you were all the same.",
    "The buildings, the dry classrooms.",
    "I embraced your eyes, your avenues.",
    "You were fixed in the same expressions.",
    "Your flat voices, your dental work,",
    "like your lips, slipping over words already said.",
    "Additional agricultural pamphlets;",
    "many of you sat in private offices.",
    "Why did I think I could drag it all back,",
    "the former edge of town where",
    "streets ended in fields under clouds",
    "puffed like the French phrases",
    "he kissed me with in the sucked-in breath",
    "of that illusive happiness.",
    "Coming back, listening, looking;",
    "ready to take your bodies in my hands.",
    "Returning to streets that had poured",
    "heavy shopping malls",
    "over the hay-sweet grass",
    "where he and I lay whispering",
    "the most important nonsense",
    "of my desperate and embittered life."
