    "Kids once carried tin soldiers in their pockets as charms",
    "against being afraid, but how trust soldiers these days",
    "not to load up, aim, blast the pants off your legs?",
    "I have a key-chain zebra I bought at the Thanksgiving fair.",
    "How do I know she won't kick, or bite at my crotch?",
    "Because she's been murdered, machine-gunned: she's dead.",
    "Also, she's a she: even so crudely carved, you can tell",
    "by the sway of her belly a foal's inside her.",
    "Even murdered mothers don't hurt people, do they?",
    "And how know she's murdered? Isn't everything murdered?",
    "Some dictator's thugs, some rebels, some poachers;",
    "some drought, world-drought, world-rot, pollution, extinction.",
    "Everything's murdered, but still, not good, a dead thing",
    "in with your ID and change. I fling her away, but the death",
    "of her clings, the death of her death, her murder, her slaughter.",

    ", enormous as clouds!",
    "And the marching bands, majorettes, anthems and drums!",
    "When the great bass stomped its galloping boom out",
    "to the crowd, my heart swelled with valor and pride.",
    "I remembered when we saluted, when we took off our hat."
