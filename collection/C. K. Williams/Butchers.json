    "Thank goodness we were able to wipe the Neanderthals out, beastly things,",
    "from our mountains, our tundra\u2014that way we had all the meat we might need.",
    "Thus the butcher can display under our very eyes his hands on the block,",
    "and never refer to the rooms hidden behind where dissections are effected,",
    "where flesh is reduced to its shivering atoms and remade for our delectation",
    "as cubes, cylinders, barely material puddles of admixtured horror and blood.",
    "Rembrandt knew of all this\u2014isn\u2019t his flayed beef carcass really a caveman?",
    "It\u2019s Christ also, of course, but much more a troglodyte such as we no longer are.",
    "Vanished those species\u2014begone!\u2014those tribes, those peoples, those nations\u2014",
    "Myrmidon, Ottoman, Olmec, Huron, and Kush: gone, gone, and goodbye.",
    "2",
    "But back to the chamber of torture, to Rembrandt, who was telling us surely",
    "that hoisted with such cables and hung from such hooks we too would reveal",
    "within us intricate layerings of color and pain: alive the brush is with pain,",
    "aglow with the cruelties of crimson, the cooled, oblivious ivory of our innards.",
    "Fling out the hooves of your hands! Open your breast, pluck out like an Aztec",
    "your heart howling its Cro-Magnon cries that compel to battles of riddance!",
    "Our own planet at last, where purged of wilderness, homesickness, prowling,",
    "we\u2019re no longer compelled to devour our enemies\u2019 brains, thanks to our butcher,",
    "who inhabits this palace, this senate, this sentried, barbed-wire enclosure",
    "where dare enter none but subservient breeze; bent, broken blossom; dry rain."
