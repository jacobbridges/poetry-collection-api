    "carefully treated with a protective wax",
    "so that visitors may touch them.",
    "\u2014",
    "Stone soldier, it's okay now.",
    "I've removed my rings, my watch, my bracelets.",
    "I'm allowed, brave girl,",
    "to touch you here, where the mail covers your throat,",
    "your full neck, down your shoulders",
    "to here, where raised unlatchable buckles",
    "mock-fasten your plated armor.",
    "Nothing peels from you.",
    "Your skin gleams like the silver earrings",
    "you do not wear.",
    "Above you, museum windows gleam October.",
    "Above you, high gold leaves flinch in the garden,",
    "but the flat immovable leaves entwined in your hair to crown you",
    "go through what my fingers can't.",
    "I want you to have a mind I can turn in my hands.",
    "You have a smooth and upturned chin,",
    "cold cheeks, unbruisable eyes,",
    "and hair as grooved as fig skin.",
    "It's October, but it's not October",
    "behind your ears, which don't hint",
    "of dark birds moving overhead,",
    "or of the blush and canary leaves",
    "emptying themselves",
    "in slow spasms",
    "into shallow hedgerows.",
    "Still bride of your own armor,",
    "bride of your own blind eyes,",
    "this isn't an appeal.",
    "If I could I would let your hair down",
    "and make your ears disappear.",
    "Your head at my shoulder, my fingers on your lips\u2014",
    "as if the cool of your stone curls were the cool",
    "of an evening\u2014",
    "as if you were about to eat salt from my hand."
