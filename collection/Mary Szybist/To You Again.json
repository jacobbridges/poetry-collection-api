    "Again this morning my eyes woke up too close",
    "to your eyes,",
    "their almost green orbs",
    "too heavy-lidded to really look back.",
    "To wake up next to you",
    "is ordinary. I do not even need to look at you",
    "to see you.",
    "But I do look. So when you come to me",
    "in your opulent sadness, I see",
    "you do not want me",
    "to unbutton you",
    "so I cannot do the one thing",
    "I can do.",
    "Now it is almost one a.m. I am still at my desk",
    "and you are upstairs at your desk a staircase",
    "away from me. Already it is years",
    "of you a staircase",
    "away from me. To be near you",
    "and not near you",
    "is ordinary.",
    "You",
    "are ordinary.",
    "Still, how many afternoons have I spent",
    "peeling blue paint from",
    "our porch steps, peering above",
    "hedgerows, the few parked cars for the first",
    "glimpse of you. How many hours under",
    "the overgrown, pink Camillas, thinking",
    "the color was wrong for you, thinking",
    "you'd appear",
    "after my next",
    "blink.",
    "Soon you'll come down the stairs",
    "to tell me something. And I'll say,",
    "okay. Okay. I'll say it",
    "like that, say it just like",
    "that, I'll go on being",
    "your never-enough.",
    "It's not the best in you",
    "I long for. It's when you're noteless,",
    "numb at the ends of my fingers, all is",
    "all. I say it is."
