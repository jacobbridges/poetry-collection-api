    "Mary who mattered to me, gone or asleep",
    "among fruits, spilled",
    "in ash, in dust, I did not",
    "leave you. Even now I can't keep from",
    "composing you, limbs",
    "blue cloak",
    "soft hands. I sleep to the sound",
    "of your name, I say there is no Mary",
    "except the word Mary, no trace",
    "on the dust of my pillowslip. I only",
    "dream of your ankles brushed by dark violets,",
    "of honeybees above you",
    "murmuring into a crown. Antique queen,",
    "the night dreams on: here are the pears",
    "I have washed for you, here the heavy-winged doves,",
    "asleep by the hyacinths. Here I am,",
    "having bathed carefully in the syllables",
    "of your name, in the air and the sea of them, the sharp scent",
    "of their sea foam. What is the matter with me?",
    "Mary, what word, what dust",
    "can I look behind? I carried you a long way",
    "into my mirror, believing you would carry me",
    "back out. Mary, I am still",
    "for you, I am still a numbness for you."
