    "The job was easy: I tucked",
    "them in, kicked off my shoes, listened for",
    "the floor to go quiet. Everyone",
    "slept except one: outside her door,",
    "she paced, she hummed, holding",

    "At first it was just to",
    "quiet her. I could only sleep",
    "if she slept, and I needed relief",
    "from myself. That is how she",
    "became a body next to mine",
    "whether or not I wanted there to be",
    "a body. She climbed",
    "into my bed. I let her",
    "sleep hot and damp against my spine.",
    "All night she rocked, she turned,",
    "she poked her spastic elbows",
    "into my calves and slurred",
    "her broken noises in the dark. All the old",
    "fans went round in clicks",
    "those summer nights\u2014and she rolled",
    "in bed and kicked",
    "me in the head and I was",
    "happy. No words, no tricks,",
    "I just didn't love",
    "my loneliness. My mind",
    "felt cooler",
    "with her there. Beside",
    "her, I could have been anyone.",
    "She had no word for me and not the kind",
    "of mind to keep one.",
    "And if she kicked",
    "me, some nights, just",
    "for the fun of it\u2014who was I",
    "to disappoint my one?",
    "Sometimes I imagine I",
    "was someone she won",
    "at a fair as the wheel spun",
    "under the floating, unfaltering sun",
    "and clicked each lucky one",
    "and one",
    "until I was happily undone."
