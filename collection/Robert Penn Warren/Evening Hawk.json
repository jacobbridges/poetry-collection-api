    "From plane of light to plane, wings dipping through",
    "Geometries and orchids that the sunset builds,",
    "Out of the peak's black angularity of shadow, riding",
    "The last tumultuous avalanche of",
    "Light above pines and the guttural gorge,",
    "The hawk comes.",
    "His wing",
    "Scythes down another day, his motion",
    "Is that of the honed steel-edge, we hear",
    "The crashless fall of stalks of Time.",
    "The head of each stalk is heavy with the gold of our error.",
    "Look! Look! he is climbing the last light",
    "Who knows neither Time nor error, and under",
    "Whose eye, unforgiving, the world, unforgiven, swings",
    "Into shadow.",
    "Long now,",
    "The last thrush is still, the last bat",
    "Now cruises in his sharp hieroglyphics. His wisdom",
    "Is ancient, too, and immense. The star",
    "Is steady, like Plato, over the mountain.",
    "If there were no wind we might, we think, hear",
    "The earth grind on its axis, or history",
    "Drip in darkness like a leaking pipe in the cellar."
