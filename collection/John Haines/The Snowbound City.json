    "I believe in this stalled magnificence,",
    "this churning chaos of traffic,",
    "a beast with broken spine,",
    "its hoarse voice hooded in feathers",
    "and mist; the baffled eyes",
    "wink amber and slowly darken.",
    "Of men and women suddenly walking,",
    "stumbling with little sleighs",
    "in search of Tibetan houses \u2014",
    "dust from a far-off mountain",
    "already whitens their shoulders.",
    "When evening falls in blurred heaps,",
    "a man losing his way among churches",
    "and schoolyards feels under his cold hand",
    "the stone thoughts of that city,",
    "impassable to all but a few children",
    "who went on into the hidden life",
    "of caves and winter fires,",
    "their faces glowing with disaster."
