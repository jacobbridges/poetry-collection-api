    "Facing the wind of the avenues",
    "one spring evening in New York,",
    "I wore under my thin jacket",
    "a sweater given me by the wife",
    "of a genial Manchurian.",
    "The warmth in that sweater changed",
    "the indifferent city block by block.",
    "The buildings were mountains",
    "that fled as I approached them.",
    "The traffic became sheep and cattle",
    "milling in muddy pastures.",
    "I could feel around me the large",
    "movements of men and horses.",
    "It was spring in Siberia or Mongolia,",
    "wherever I happened to be.",
    "Rough but honest voices called to me",
    "out of that solitude:",
    "they told me we are all tired",
    "of this coiling weight,",
    "the oppression of a long winter;",
    "that it was time to renew our life,",
    "burn the expired contracts,",
    "elect new governments.",
    "The old Imperial sun has set,",
    "and I must write a poem to the Emperor.",
    "I shall speak it like the man",
    "I should be, an inhabitant of the frontier,",
    "clad in sweat-darkened wool,",
    "my face stained by wind and smoke.",
    "Surely the Emperor and his court",
    "will want to know what a fine",
    "and generous revolution begins tomorrow",
    "in one of his remote provinces...",
    "(1967)"
