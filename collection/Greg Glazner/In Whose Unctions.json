    "By now the snow is easing",
    "the live nerves of the wire fence",
    "and the firs,",
    "softening the distances it falls through,",
    "laying down a rightness,",
    "as in the spackled whites,",
    "the woodgrains of a room\u2019s hush",
    "before music,",
    "before a lush legato in whose unctions",
    "the excruciations ease,",
    "as in the first",
    "thick arrhythmics from the hardwoods",
    "of the late quartets,",
    "whose dense snow of emotion,",
    "downdrifting,",
    "formal,",
    "whose violins and cellos,",
    "desiring the exhilarations of changes,",
    "turn loose an infusion",
    "of wintry music, all sideslip and immense descent,",
    "repetitions, evolutions",
    "salving down into the still air,",
    "the wound,",
    "the listening."
