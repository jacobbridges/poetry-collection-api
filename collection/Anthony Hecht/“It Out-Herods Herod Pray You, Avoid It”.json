    "Tonight my children hunch",
    "Toward their Western, and are glad",
    "As, with a Sunday punch,",
    "The Good casts out the Bad.",
    "And in their fairy tales",
    "The warty giant and witch",
    "Get sealed in doorless jails",
    "And the match-girl strikes it rich.",
    "I\u2019ve made myself a drink.",
    "The giant and witch are set",
    "To bust out of the clink",
    "When my children have gone to bed.",
    "All frequencies are loud",
    "With signals of despair;",
    "In flash and morse they crowd",
    "The rondure of the air.",
    "For the wicked have grown strong,",
    "Their numbers mock at death,",
    "Their cow brings forth its young,",
    "Their bull engendereth.",
    "Their very fund of strength,",
    "Satan, bestrides the globe;",
    "He stalks its breadth and length",
    "And finds out even Job.",
    "Yet by quite other laws",
    "My children make their case;",
    "Half God, half Santa Claus,",
    "But with my voice and face,",
    "A hero comes to save",
    "The poorman, beggarman, thief,",
    "And make the world behave",
    "And put an end to grief.",
    "And that their sleep be sound",
    "I say this childermas",
    "Who could not, at one time,",
    "Have saved them from the gas."
