    "Now he has silver in him. When sometime",
    "Death shall boil down unnecessary fat",
    "To reach the nub of our identity,",
    "When in the run of crime",
    "The skull is rifled for the gold in teeth,",
    "And chemistry has eaten from the spine",
    "Superfluous life and vigor, why then he",
    "Will show a richness to be wondered at,",
    "And shall be thought a mine",
    "Whose claim and stake are stone and floral wreath.",
    "The body burns away, and burning gives",
    "Light to the eye and moisture to the lip",
    "And warmth to our desires, but it burns",
    "Whatever body lives",
    "Into extinction though it wear a plate",
    "Of armor in it: therefore do we thrive",
    "In fear of fire, in terror of the ship",
    "That carries us to fire. A soldier learns",
    "To bear the silver weight",
    "Where in his head the fire is most alive."
