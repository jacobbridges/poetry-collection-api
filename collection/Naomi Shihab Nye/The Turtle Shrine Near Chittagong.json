    "Humps of shell emerge from dark water.",
    "Believers toss hunks of bread,",
    "hoping the fat reptilian heads",
    "will loom forth from the murk",
    "and eat. Meaning:",
    "heard.",
    "I stood, breathing the stench of mud",
    "and rotten dough, and could not feel",
    "encouraged. Climbed the pilgrim hill",
    "where prayers in tissue radiant tubes",
    "were looped to a tree. Caught in",
    "their light, a hope washed over me",
    "small as the hope of stumbling feet",
    "but did not hold long enough",
    "to get me down.",
    "Rickshas crowded the field,",
    "announced by tinny bells.",
    "The friend beside me, whose bread",
    "floated and bobbed,",
    "grew grim. They\u2019re full, I told him.",
    "That night I told the man I love most",
    "he came from hell. It was also",
    "his birthday. We gulped lobster",
    "over a white tablecloth in a country",
    "where waves erase whole villages, annually,",
    "and don\u2019t even make our front page.",
    "Waiters forded the lulling currents",
    "of heat. Later, my mosquito net",
    "had holes.",
    "All night, I was pitching something,",
    "crumbs or crusts, into that bottomless pool",
    "where the spaces between our worlds take root.",
    "He would forgive me tomorrow.",
    "But I wanted a mouth to rise up",
    "from the dark, a hand,",
    "any declarable body part, to swallow",
    "or say,"
