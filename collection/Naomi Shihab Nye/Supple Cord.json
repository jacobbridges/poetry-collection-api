    "My brother, in his small white bed,",
    "held one end.",
    "I tugged the other",
    "to signal I was still awake.",
    "We could have spoken,",
    "could have sung",
    "to one another,",
    "we were in the same room",
    "for five years,",
    "but the soft cord",
    "with its little frayed ends",
    "connected us",
    "in the dark,",
    "gave comfort",
    "even if we had been bickering",
    "all day.",
    "When he fell asleep first",
    "and his end of the cord",
    "dropped to the floor,",
    "I missed him terribly,",
    "though I could hear his even breath",
    "and we had such long and separate lives",
    "ahead."
