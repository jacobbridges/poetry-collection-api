    "Every few minutes, he wants",
    "to march the trail of flattened rye grass",
    "back to the house of muttering",
    "hens. He too could make",
    "a bed in hay. Yesterday the egg so fresh",
    "it felt hot in his hand and he pressed it",
    "to his ear while the other children",
    "laughed and ran with a ball, leaving him,",
    "so little yet, too forgetful in games,",
    "ready to cry if the ball brushed him,",
    "riveted to the secret of birds",
    "caught up inside his fist,",
    "not ready to give it over",
    "to the refrigerator",
    "or the rest of the day."
