    "Morning glories, pale as a mist drying,",
    "fade from the heat of the day, but already",
    "hunchback bees in pirate pants and with peg-leg",
    "hooks have found and are boarding them.",
    "This could do for the sack of the imaginary",
    "fleet. The raiders loot the galleons even as they",
    "one by one vanish and leave still real",
    "only what has been snatched out of the spell.",
    "I\u2019ve never seen bees more purposeful except",
    "when the hive is threatened. They know",
    "the good of it must be grabbed and hauled",
    "before the whole feast wisps off.",
    "They swarm in light and, fast, dive in,",
    "then drone out, slow, their pantaloons heavy",
    "with gold and sunlight. The line of them,",
    "like thin smoke, wafts over the hedge.",
    "And back again to find the fleet gone.",
    "Well, they got this day\u2019s good of it. Off",
    "they cruise to what stays open longer.",
    "Nothing green gives honey. And by now",
    "you\u2019d have to look twice to see more than green",
    "where all those white sails trembled",
    "when the world was misty and open",
    "and the prize was there to be taken."
