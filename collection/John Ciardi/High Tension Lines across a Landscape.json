    "There are diagrams on stilts all wired together",
    "Over the hill and the wind and out of sight.",
    "There is a scar in the trees where they walk away",
    "Beyond me. There are signs of something",
    "Nearly God (or at least most curious)",
    "About them. I think those diagrams are not",
    "At rest.",
    "I think they are a way of ciphering God:",
    "He is the hugest socket and all his miracles",
    "Are wired behind him scarring the hill and the wind",
    "As the waterfall flies roaring to his city",
    "On the open palms of the diagram.",
    "There is",
    "Shining, I suppose, in that city at night",
    "And measure for miracles, and wheels whirling",
    "So quick-silver they seem to be going backwards.",
    "And there\u2019s a miracle already. But I",
    "Went naked through his wood of diagrams",
    "On a day of the rain beside me to his city.",
    "When I kissed that socket with my wet lip",
    "My teeth fell out, my fingers sprouted chives,",
    "And what a bald head chewed on my sick heart!"
