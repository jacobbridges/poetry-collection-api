    "Back when the earth was new",
    "and heaven just a whisper,",
    "back when the names of things",
    "hadn't had time to stick;",
    "back when the smallest breezes",
    "melted summer into autumn,",
    "when all the poplars quivered",
    "sweetly in rank and file . . .",
    "the world called, and I answered.",
    "Each glance ignited to a gaze.",
    "I caught my breath and called that life,",
    "swooned between spoonfuls of lemon sorbet.",
    "I was pirouette and flourish,",
    "I was filigree and flame.",
    "How could I count my blessings",
    "when I didn't know their names?",
    "Back when everything was still to come,",
    "luck leaked out everywhere.",
    "I gave my promise to the world,",
    "and the world followed me here."
