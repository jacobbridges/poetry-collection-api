    "Imagine you wake up",
    "with a second chance: The blue jay",
    "hawks his pretty wares",

    "eggs and sausage on the grill.",
    "The whole sky is yours",
    "to write on, blown open",
    "to a blank page. Come on,",
    "shake a leg! You'll never know",
    "who's down there, frying those eggs,",
    "if you don't get up and see."
