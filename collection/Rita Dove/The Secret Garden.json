    "I was ill, lying on my bed of old papers,",
    "when you came with white rabbits in your arms;",
    "and the doves scattered upwards, flying to mothers,",
    "and the snails sighed under their baggage of stone . . .",
    "Now your tongue grows like celery between us:",
    "Because of our love-cries, cabbage darkens in its nest;",
    "the cauliflower thinks of her pale, plump children",
    "and turns greenish-white in a light like the ocean\u2019s.",
    "I was sick, fainting in the smell of teabags,",
    "when you came with tomatoes, a good poetry.",
    "I am being wooed. I am being conquered",
    "by a cliff of limestone that leaves chalk on my breasts."
