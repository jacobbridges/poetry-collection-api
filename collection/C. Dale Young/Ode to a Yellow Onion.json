    "And what if I had simply passed you by,",
    "your false skins gathering light in a basket,",
    "those skins of unpolished copper,",
    "would you have lived more greatly?",
    "Now you are free of that metallic coating,",
    "a broken hull of parchment,",
    "the dried petals of a lily\u2014",
    "those who have not loved you",
    "will not know differently.",
    "But you are green fading into yellow\u2014",
    "how deceptive you have been.",
    "Once I played the cithara,",
    "fingers chafing against each note.",
    "Once I worked the loom,",
    "cast the shuttle through the warp.",
    "Once I scrubbed the tiles",
    "deep in the tub of Alejandro.",
    "Now I try to deciper you.",
    "Beyond the village, within a cloud",
    "of wild cacao and tamarind,",
    "they chant your tale, how you,",
    "most common of your kind,",
    "make the great warrior-men cry",
    "but a woman can unravel you."
