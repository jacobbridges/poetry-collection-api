    "Like the stamen inside a flower",
    "The steeple stands in lovely blue",
    "And the day unfolds around its needle;",
    "The flock of swallows that circles the steeple",
    "Flies there each day through the same blue air",
    "That carries their cries from me to you;",
    "We know how high the sun is now",
    "As long as the roof of the steeple glows,",
    "The roof that\u2019s covered with sheets of tin;",
    "Up there in the wind, where the wind is not",
    "Turning the vane of the weathercock,",
    "The weathercock silently crows in the wind."
