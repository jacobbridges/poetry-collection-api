    "of chess with Death,",
    "though not in a dreamscape",
    "black-and-white as melancholy",
    "films clanking with symbols,",
    "but in a garden in Provence",
    "with goldfish in the fountain",
    "and enormous palms whose topmost",
    "fronds cut into the eternal",
    "blue of sky above the Roman",
    "ruins and the dusty streets",
    "where any door may lead to life\u2019s",

    "the ones whose paths",
    "through life have least",
    "prepared them to resist",
    "the monster, I think of",
    "an insatiable and prowling beast",
    "with razor teeth and a persistent",
    "stink that sticks to every",

    "its rank fur brushes",
    "as it stalks its prey.",

    "arms and legs pinned down with needles,",
    "pain of tubes and needles, his narrow",
    "chest inflated by machine, his mind",
    "lost in the seven-minute gap",
    "between the respirator\u2019s failure",
    "and the time the nurses noticed",
    "something wrong. I wrapped",
    "my limbs around that fragile body",
    "for the first time seven years",
    "ago, in a cheap hotel by the piers,",

    "in a rag convinced him not to take",
    "the pills with which he might",
    "still be alive, Dwight",
    "on the runway, Dwight on the phone",
    "suggesting we could still have sex",
    "if we wore \u201craincoats,\u201d Dwight",

    "transformed. Dwight erased,",
    "evicted from his own young body.",
    "Dwight dead. At Bellevue, I wrapped",
    "my arms around his second skin",
    "of gauze and scars and tubing,",
    "brushed my hand against",
    "his plats, and said goodbye.",
    "I hope I\u2019m not the one",
    "who loosed the devouring animal",
    "that massacred you, gentle boy.",
    "You didn\u2019t have a clue",

    "horror of the kill, no way",
    "to bail out, no bright",
    "parachute beside my bed."
