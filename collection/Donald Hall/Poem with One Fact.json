    "\"At pet stores in Detroit, you can buy",
    "frozen rats",
    "for seventy-five cents apiece, to feed",
    "your pet boa constrictor\"",
    "back home in Grosse Pointe,",
    "or in Grosse Pointe Park,",
    "while the free nation of rats",
    "in Detroit emerges",
    "from alleys behind pet shops, from cellars",
    "and junked cars, and gathers",
    "to flow at twilight",
    "like a river the color of pavement,",
    "and crawls over bedrooms and groceries",
    "and through broken",
    "school windows to eat the crayon",
    "from drawings of rats\u2014",
    "and no one in Detroit understands",
    "how rats are delicious in Dearborn.",
    "If only we could",
    ", if only",
    "the boa constrictors of Southfield",
    "would slither down I-94,",
    "turn north on the Lodge Expressway,",
    "and head for Eighth Street, to eat",
    "out for a change. Instead, tomorrow,",
    "a man from Birmingham enters",
    "a pet shop in Detroit",
    "to buy a frozen German shepherd",
    "for six dollars and fifty cents",
    "to feed his pet cheetah,",
    "guarding the compound at home.",
    "Oh, they arrive all day, in their",
    "locked cars, buying",
    "schoolyards, bridges, buses,",
    "churches, and Ethnic Festivals;",
    "they buy a frozen Texaco station",
    "for eighty-four dollars and fifty cents",
    "to feed to an imported London taxi",
    "in Huntington Woods;",
    "they buy Tiger Stadium,",
    "frozen, to feed to the Little League",
    "in Grosse Ile. They bring everything",
    "home, frozen solid",
    "as pig iron, to the six-car garages",
    "of Harper Woods, Grosse Pointe Woods,",
    "Farmington, Grosse Pointe",
    "Farms, Troy, and Grosse Arbor\u2014",
    "and they ingest",
    "everything, and fall asleep, and lie",
    "coiled in the sun, while the city",
    "thaws in the stomach and slides",
    "to the small intestine, where enzymes",
    "break down molecules of protein",
    "to amino acids, which enter",
    "the cold bloodstream."
