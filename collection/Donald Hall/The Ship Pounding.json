    "Each morning I made my way",
    "among gangways, elevators,",
    "and nurses\u2019 pods to Jane\u2019s room",
    "to interrogate the grave helpers",
    "who tended her through the night",
    "while the ship\u2019s massive engines",
    "kept its propellers turning.",
    "Week after week, I sat by her bed",
    "with black coffee and the",
    ".",
    "The passengers on this voyage",
    "wore masks or cannulae",
    "or dangled devices that dripped",
    "chemicals into their wrists.",
    "I believed that the ship",
    "traveled to a harbor",
    "of breakfast, work, and love.",
    "I wrote: \"When the infusions",
    "are infused entirely, bone",
    "marrow restored and lymphoblasts",
    "remitted, I will take my wife,",
    "bald as Michael Jordan,",
    "back to our dog and day.\" Today,",
    "months later at home, these",
    "words turned up on my desk",
    "as I listened in case Jane called",
    "for help, or spoke in delirium,",
    "ready to make the agitated",
    "drive to Emergency again",
    "for readmission to the huge",
    "vessel that heaves water month",
    "after month, without leaving",
    "port, without moving a knot,",
    "without arrival or destination,",
    "its great engines pounding."
