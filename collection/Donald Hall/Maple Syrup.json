    "August, goldenrod blowing. We walk",
    "into the graveyard, to find",
    "my grandfather\u2019s grave. Ten years ago",
    "I came here last, bringing",
    "marigolds from the round garden",
    "outside the kitchen.",
    "I didn\u2019t know you then.",
    "We walk",
    "among carved names that go with photographs",
    "on top of the piano at the farm:",
    "Keneston, Wells, Fowler, Batchelder, Buck.",
    "We pause at the new grave",
    "of Grace Fenton, my grandfather\u2019s",
    "sister. Last summer",
    "we called on her at the nursing home,",
    "eighty-seven, and nodding",
    "in a blue housedress. We cannot find",
    "my grandfather\u2019s grave.",
    "Back at the house",
    "where no one lives, we potter",
    "and explore the back chamber",
    "where everything comes to rest: spinning wheels,",
    "pretty boxes, quilts,",
    "bottles, books, albums of postcards.",
    "Then with a flashlight we descend",
    "firm steps to the root cellar\u2014black,",
    "cobwebby, huge,",
    "with dirt floors and fieldstone walls,",
    "and above the walls, holding the hewn",
    "sills of the house, enormous",
    "granite foundation stones.",
    "Past the empty bins",
    "for squash, apples, carrots, and potatoes,",
    "we discover the shelves for canning, a few",
    "pale pints",
    "of tomato left, and\u2014what",
    "is this?\u2014syrup, maple syrup",
    "in a quart jar, syrup",
    "my grandfather made twenty-five",
    "years ago",
    "for the last time.",
    "I remember",
    "coming to the farm in March",
    "in sugaring time, as a small boy.",
    "He carried the pails of sap, sixteen-quart",
    "buckets, dangling from each end",
    "of a wooden yoke",
    "that lay across his shoulders, and emptied them",
    "into a vat in the saphouse",
    "where fire burned day and night",
    "for a week.",
    "Now the saphouse",
    "tilts, nearly to the ground,",
    "like someone exhausted",
    "to the point of death, and next winter",
    "when snow piles three feet thick",
    "on the roofs of the cold farm,",
    "the saphouse will shudder and slide",
    "with the snow to the ground.",
    "Today",
    "we take my grandfather\u2019s last",
    "quart of syrup",
    "upstairs, holding it gingerly,",
    "and we wash off twenty-five years",
    "of dirt, and we pull",
    "and pry the lid up, cutting the stiff,",
    "dried rubber gasket, and dip our fingers",
    "in, you and I both, and taste",
    "the sweetness, you for the first time,",
    "the sweetness preserved, of a dead man",
    "in the kitchen he left",
    "when his body slid",
    "like anyone\u2019s into the ground."
