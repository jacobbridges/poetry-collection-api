    "The grasses are light brown",
    "and the ocean comes in",
    "long shimmering lines",
    "under the fleet from last night",

    "Here and there horses graze",
    "on somebody\u2019s acreage",
    "Strangely, it was not my desire",
    "that bade me speak in church to be released",
    "but memory of the way it used to be in",
    "careless and exotic play",
    "when characters were promises",
    "then recognitions. The world of transformation",
    "is real and not real but trusting.",

    "love\u2019s mysterious bonds?",
    "Well I myself am not myself",
    "and which power of survival I speak",
    "for is not made of houses.",
    "It is inner luxury, of golden figures",
    "that breathe like mountains do",
    "and whose skin is made dusky by stars."
