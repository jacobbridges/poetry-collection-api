    "1.",
    "It unfolds and ripples like a banner, downward. All the stories",
    "come folding out. The smells and flowers begin to come back, as",
    "the tapestry is brightly colored and brocaded. Rabbits and violets.",
    "Who asked you to come over? She got her foot in the door and",
    "would not remove it, elbowing and talking swiftly. Gas leak?",
    "that sounds like a very existential position; perhaps you had",
    "better check with the landlord.",
    "This was no better than the",
    "predicament I had just read about. Now it was actually changing",
    "before my eyes. Sometimes it will come to a standstill though,",
    "and finally the reflection can begin.",
    "Selfless\u2014that was the proposition. Smiling and moving instantly",
    "there was no other purpose than that which brought them there,",
    "to be in a particular place.",
    "2.",
    "This time the mule gave its face away. Take your cadillac",
    "where you want to go in the morning, convertible as it might be,",
    "and enjoy a good bottle of rum.",
    "Running on this way she used various modes of expression that",
    "were current. Nothing seemed to bring the woods any closer.",
    "What Woods, she was questioned, realizing that as far as the",
    "woods went, they were largely inhabitable through the facility",
    "of her mind. At the Philadelphia Flower Show, an ideal situation",
    "was built up. Here through various regulated artificial conditions,",
    "spring grass, waterfalls, the newly-sprouted bulbs completed",
    "her ideal concept of nature. The smell was overpowering.",
    "All right then. She had a thing about nature, from flower",
    "show glamor and enormous greenhouses the rich cultivated.",
    "A beauty of cultivation\u2014in living? Hastiness did not prevent",
    "her from rising quick and ready to misnomers and other odd",
    "conclusions, throwing the telephone book to the floor, \u201cOH OH",
    "the life I am entangled in.\u201d Four sides of it.",
    "Above was a paradisical",
    "level, incompleted. With working possibilities.",
    "Below, endless preoccupations and variations were possible.",
    "Currently in vogue were shelves, the vacuum cleaner, a new",
    "bedspread and color scheme for pillows.",
    "Taste treats were",
    "unresponsive. Glamor do\u2019s were out. Conversation was nil.",
    "Languid",
    "she could not even find a place to languish upon that was",
    "fulfilling in its own way.",
    "So out of the lifelessness that was around her,",
    "the grape leaves drying out, and",
    "the avocado was",
    "sprouting,",
    "she thought, Why",
    "fantasy? Tugging at this character and",
    "that, trying to push a little life in a prince or a charmer, a half-",
    "blind bat, dryad, the works of the story teller. Here the four",
    "walls of the room and ceiling became apparent again. \u201cI ought",
    "to tighten down and make sure I say",
    "what I mean.\u201d",
    "And her face took on a tight pinched expression, and thrifty scotch",
    "economy gave her shrewd eyes in the prescribed way. Use",
    "tidbit,",
    ". Once upon a time there was a princess who",
    "had a long white fur coat with a high fluffy collar, and inside the",
    "coat were stitched beautiful butterflies in many bright colors.",
    "The princess languished. She was not sure where to sit to her best",
    "advantage to enjoy herself the most. She could not go",
    "her mind",
    "or",
    ". She looked at her long white hand, I am the Queen of the",
    "High Mountain Hag, she murmured to herself, still knowing she was",
    "a princess. She lay down upon the floor as if it were the garden of",
    "eden, the coat spread around her.",
    "No, that poor little house she",
    "had built was a bore. It\u2019s better that it go up in flames, as it did.",
    "She went down to Grand Central Station and gave away flowers.",
    "Some people took them and some people didn\u2019t.",
    "3.",
    "I\u2019m glad to get back. I had to repeat a rough discontinuous journey.",
    "Questioning myself all along the way. Was I jumping on her because",
    "her time had come to an end. Indeed I pounded on his arm all night,",
    "over his concern for this soft-spoken individual, I can see nothing",
    "but their softness. Me ME, and the time we might spend together,",
    "reading and talking, to tear away that putrid husk.",
    "My flippancy is gone. Now I have started my secret life again,",
    "in transition, reminding. As the moth reminds, its feeble antenna",
    "groping, taken like a stalk of fern, coins of money.",
    "All over I was shaking as the fear and tension made itself apparent.",
    "It was a cold night out. It was colder still between the airy gaps,",
    "between blankets.",
    "You can see she is thoughtful",
    "as she draws the string to the bow. Where to go indeed. The",
    "point is brought forward and discussed very cleverly.",
    "A sleeping angel or a sleeping troll? I was rather proud of being",
    "used, pushing the clothing hampers up and down the downtown",
    "street. Here, pleasant mentors conveyed their anxious solicitations,",
    "drawing from their bags, long lists of memorandum due, what I owed.",
    "It was a lot, if I hesitated. I choose to go on, saying this is the",
    "way I go, owing nothing, being that kind of person. Hung up?",
    "That thought intrudes as the clearly marked vista is not so clearly",
    "marked. Certainly one supposes in all honesty, that an essential",
    "core of feeling blooms in each encounter. Lost under the weight",
    "of the garbage of who are you that you are not making apparent.",
    "Thus unhappy, I don\u2019t want it to be this way, and so forth.",
    "Not costumes, or paraphernalia, the immediate reactions.",
    "4.",
    "We of course are in a family situation. Anything I wish might",
    "happen, but the larger situations are not real, not to be",
    "considered possible, discussable as to what sense of reality",
    "they possessed.",
    "In the snow, the wood piled up underneath. Oh those drifting",
    "sensibilities. At this point it is scarcely believable that people",
    "gather and like each other. Eating chocolate pudding, getting",
    "in touch with some other sense of alikeness. The form is no",
    "longer obvious to me. Whether they meander or are joined together",
    "in their senses in the mechanics or regular grooves they run along.",
    "I suspect that in this house, this",
    "place that is musty and left as it was some years ago, there is",
    "no real fear; the objects are old and I am not familiar with them,",
    "only the sense that the Ghost or spirit world strikes you with",
    "its familiarity, pleasurable fear.",
    "Here the familiar",
    "is apt to make its presence known, at any moment the unexpected",
    "lurk in the hall, into the room. Pieces of leather, old silken fans",
    "laid upon the table top, rooms filled with something left unexpectedly",
    "terror is the wrong combination of ignorance. It contains its own",
    "self with dusty fragments of velvet and fringe. 100 pieces of voice",
    "with no name, called it myself, as they spoke all day, sucking the",
    "soft slush, admitting their real deficiencies as\u2014",
    "I am never sure; Oh it\u2019s that power",
    "and disease of believing in the stale that doesn\u2019t demand a real",
    "climate, takes its capacity when the demons come down.",
    "5.",
    "The night passes in night time. The head moving to the shoulder,",
    "the head rising with a frown.",
    "In a firm voice, it doesn\u2019t matter if the hair is flying from undue",
    "spring breezes, the self has been raptured on the wine that produces",
    "appropriate madness, and sad she says, my dear the bacchanal is a",
    "lovely way to be rid of waste.",
    "However, in seeing the house more manageable, one cannot even have",
    "fear larger than the unknown portions of the continent which",
    "refuses to sink.",
    "There once was a woman",
    "who grew older, not that she minded, but the passage of time was",
    "always constant. Why does one have to contend with that she said,",
    "puzzled, as she got carried along, and",
    "had to think up",
    "new coping modes of behavior. If he behaved to me thus when he was",
    "40, now that I am 30, I can hardly behave like that to those that are",
    "20, and so forth. There wasn\u2019t any model except the one she built,",
    "and one could scarcely believe there was no established pattern. This",
    "offered wonderful possibilities, but also indecision and gutlessness.",
    "6.",
    "You can\u2019t see them, all bundled up, all those that choose",
    "to move other than where the distance seems appealing. Knowledge",
    "has no depth. There isn\u2019t any message to be spoken.",
    "Wrangling, she speaks ill-advised my dear, as the cat has no",
    "point in laying its head down. She ought to watch carefully.",
    "The claws. It could be",
    "the bent hands, as they grow, that as the fur impeaches the",
    "rose, doesn\u2019t make the thing she hangs her body on any realer.",
    "What could it be all about? The necessity to follow, balancing,",
    "contemplating words, as the basis of why we move at all.",
    "Just a little touch. The leader cautioned further progression.",
    "I could hardly listen to the music for long. Now there",
    "seemed to be interruptions, pleasurable interludes, nothing",
    "definite, of a fragmented nature.",
    "Certainly I wished the best",
    "for all. The sadder soldiers stumbled idly, as I also in the",
    "profound reaches of my slumber noted the elegant turns, the",
    "twisting statements grooving into the language building something",
    "to listen to. The dress made from silk. Trusting was awkward",
    "and not of a nature to ease any further building. Whosoever",
    "you revere will come back tenfold upon you and lighten the",
    "burden carried as those who desire the warmth and necessity of",
    "communication.",
    "7.",
    "I am sure my dreams must have been of the wrong sort. However, as",
    "dreams are reflections of inner dilemmas, how did those arise, from",
    "a day of relaxation and summer enjoyment of the fund.",
    "Knowledge comes from what purported strike? From that which cleanses,",
    "and let us knot say \u201cheart\u201d but",
    ". Hopefully and helpfully I have",
    "built up a language in which to talk myself to sleep. Not for purposes",
    "of letting in the cold.",
    "However, I have found that not all blockaded",
    "against is the cold, the dreary reign of the dead, etc., and tasteless",
    "realm of the mushroom. As much can be denied as the bilious sun",
    "strives to cause an enlargement of singing in the back of the neck and",
    "the head. That is uncorraled ecstasy. I call it enthusiasm, free energy.",
    "But it has no place to land, it is bursting and unfocused; it is a real force",
    "and the counterpart of the gloomy depths.",
    "As the pieces of the house",
    "ooze sap, blossoms and green twigs burst from the cracks. Whether or",
    "not to join in what I was half committed to see and do.",
    "8.",
    "At this point, when Jack picked up the pussy willow branches, I said",
    "they can\u2019t possibly be ours for the taking, and smiled with dedication",
    "to an older Con Edison man. The buildings were like the unexplored",
    "garbage in my mind, fascinating and dirty, pulling pieces of cloth",
    "from boxes left overnight. Energy as limitless possibility, in",
    "the attempt to transmit non-energy situations.",
    "For example, if once I stop to realize what little gets through, I am",
    "much more interested in the cover than the contents; it is difficult",
    "to find any interest in anything. Good energy displaces bad karma.",
    "And other non entities like that sort, producing flow that in its own",
    "place has a good bed, stocked well with what can be called fleet-footed",
    "fishes, and approaching places of investigation, such as relations",
    "between.",
    "As I saw the blood flow to the surface of his skin, I",
    "forgot to watch for the telltale visions that again might come from",
    "something I have never seen; more possibly the components of what",
    "every man views. If this was a possibility, the rays from every person",
    "converging pass through the state of shock to numbness to unity without",
    "any mind at all, for this horror fits the cat on the stairs, between",
    "the fifth and sixth rung. This is the way people glow and pulse similar",
    "to an inlet of jellyfish blocking the way, full of human life; until",
    "I who will name myself a swimmer come along and refuse to be",
    "blocked on the way, although I turn back gladly, and will again swim",
    "through for it is possible they do not kill, the sting\u2019s compounded measure",
    "is fear, and thus one not need join the broad expanse of human mouths",
    "calling people to join their ranks to comfort their newfound recognition",
    "or orifices, stomachs and legs.",
    "I reminded myself twice there were several stories that kept continuing",
    "themselves. She ignored her face, blotched and red upon times, but",
    "fuller. Did you forget to wax and wane? Her head was full of energy",
    "brought forward and positively that what was said would turn the obvious",
    "into color, but no sense. Sense was for the thinkers. Here the thinkers",
    "forgot their word orders or sense; it was better to give them coffee,",
    "and those off worse could smoke.",
    "I had felt very",
    "foolish when I leaned forward and grasped his hand, with effort, and",
    "his cloak slipped down over one shoulder as he shouted, which is the",
    "way. And I followed for certainly no one would follow me. As the day",
    "is cold and colder, and what comes out of the head is of its own sort and",
    "nature. These words, like Nature, and Head, Thinking and Words,",
    "repeat themselves, as the lines of landscape, attics and other closed-off",
    "sections have reprimanded themselves by repetition. Light",
    "was such an enormous possibility. Taking sight into a frenzy, it was",
    "possible that just to look was full of excitement and wonder, for",
    "ages at a time, things appeared as beautiful, the sky, the street",
    "where cars had gone by.",
    "I worried about certain characters: ones",
    "that never seemed to be other than puzzles to me but I was drawn to",
    "them with certainty only because there seemed to be no understanding?",
    "As when the mysteries were performed, the house then itself became",
    "distilled with reason as the pots and pans were used apparently filled",
    "with the stuff of continuity. The sorrow that each day sinks into the",
    "infertile other side of day, where voice comes out of the dark, and",
    "does its rituals. Memory has its own screen across the room to view",
    "itself, and the continuous dwelling of conjecture takes permanent form",
    "in stiff-legged walks to remind, thus on and on the breathing goes.",
