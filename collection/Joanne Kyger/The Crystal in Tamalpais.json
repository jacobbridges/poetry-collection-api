    "In Tamalpais is a big crystal. An acquaintance told",
    "me the story. A Miwok was giving his grandfather\u2019s medicine",
    "bag to the Kroeber Museum in Berkeley. He said this man",
    "took him over the mountain Tamalpais, at a certain time",
    "in the year. I believe it was about the time of the",
    "Winter Solstice, because then the tides are really low.",
    "They stopped and gathered a certain plant on the way over",
    "the mountain. On their way to the Bolinas Beach clam patch,",
    "where there is a big rock way out there.",
    "Go out to",
    "the rock. Take out of the medicine bag the crystal",
    "that matches the crystal in Tamalpais. And",
    "if your heart is not true",
    "if your heart is not true",
    "when you tap the rock in the clam patch",
    "a little piece of it will fly off",
    "and strike you in the heart",
    "and strike you dead.",
    "And that\u2019s the first story I ever heard about Bolinas."
