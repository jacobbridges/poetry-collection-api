    "No, worry about nothing",
    "but the chiseling",
    "of hills into distance",
    "in the slight haze",
    "and sleep lost over color",
    "no two ever the same",
    "the wringing hands",
    "float ashore amazed.",
    "Worry about beauty.",
    "It can sell you anything.",
    "Lakes collect in the",
    "chambers of the heart",
    "where the sailboats are made",
    "of flying fish about",
    "the size of match heads.",
    "Sleep can be lost as",
    "easily as a house key,",
    "the shock can consume",
    "at any moment",
    "if the hills are not rising",
    "weather is wearing them down",
    "and you are driving",
    "north in the late afternoon",
    "or holding your eyes",
    "in your hands like addresses."
