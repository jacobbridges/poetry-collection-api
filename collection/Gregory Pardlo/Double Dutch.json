    "The girls turning double-dutch",
    "bob & weave like boxers pulling",
    "punches, shadowing each other,",
    "sparring across the slack cord",
    "casting parabolas in the air. They",
    "whip quick as an infant\u2019s pulse",
    "and the jumper, before she",
    "enters the winking, nods in time",
    "as if she has a notion to share,",
    "waiting her chance to speak. But she\u2019s",
    "anticipating the upbeat",
    "like a bandleader counting off",
    "the tune they are about to swing into.",
    "The jumper stair-steps into mid-air",
    "as if she\u2019s jumping rope in low-gravity,",
    "training for a lunar mission. Airborne a moment",
    "long enough to fit a second thought in,",
    "she looks caught in the mouth bones of a fish",
    "as she flutter-floats into motion",
    "like a figure in a stack of time-lapse photos",
    "thumbed alive. Once inside,",
    "the bells tied to her shoestrings rouse the gods",
    "who\u2019ve lain in the dust since the Dutch",
    "acquired Manhattan. How she dances",
    "patterns like a dust-heavy bee retracing",
    "its travels in scale before the hive. How",
    "the whole stunning contraption of girl and rope",
    "slaps and scoops like a paddle boat.",
    "Her misted skin arranges the light",
    "with each adjustment and flex. Now heather-",
    "hued, now sheen, light listing on the fulcrum",
    "of a wrist and the bare jutted joints of elbow",
    "and knee, and the faceted surfaces of muscle,",
    "surfaces fracturing and reforming",
    "like a sun-tickled sleeve of running water.",
    "She makes jewelry of herself and garlands",
    "the ground with shadows.",
