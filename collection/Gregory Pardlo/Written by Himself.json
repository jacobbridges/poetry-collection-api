    "I was born in minutes in a roadside kitchen a skillet",
    "whispering my name. I was born to rainwater and lye;",
    "I was born across the river where I",
    "was borrowed with clothespins, a harrow tooth,",
    "broadsides sewn in my shoes. I returned, though",
    "it please you, through no fault of my own,",
    "pockets filled with coffee grounds and eggshells.",
    "I was born still and superstitious; I bore an unexpected burden.",
    "I gave birth, I gave blessing, I gave rise to suspicion.",
    "I was born abandoned outdoors in the heat-shaped air,",
    "air drifting like spirits and old windows.",
    "I was born a fraction and a cipher and a ledger entry;",
    "I was an index of first lines when I was born.",
    "I was born waist-deep stubborn in the water crying",
    "ain\u2019t I a woman and a brother I was born",
    "to this hall of mirrors, this horror story I was",
    "born with a prologue of references, pursued",
    "by mosquitoes and thieves, I was born passing",
    "off the problem of the twentieth century: I was born.",
    "I read minds before I could read fishes and loaves;",
    "I walked a piece of the way alone before I was born."
