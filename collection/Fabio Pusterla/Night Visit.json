    "You're dreaming",
    "of Cratoids, Armpullers, the Blownose Dragon.",
    "Who knows what Anna Brichtova dreamed about, the girl",
    "who comes looking for us tonight with her mosaic",
    "of colored paper: her house",
    "with its red roof, some trees on a green lawn,",
    "the sky\u2014outside, the concentration camp.",
    "This is the real gift",
    "I brought back from Prague without telling you.",
    "It was with me on the train the morning",
    "I thought I was living in hell: Stuttgart,",
    "or south of there, amid a drone",
    "of people working\u2014they don't know at what",
    "or for whom, but they're working, pressing keys,",
    "sending messages to unknown persons through the air.",
    "Nothing but eyes and fingers, nothing",
    "but one day after the next, interminable",
    "passage of a time that doesn't vary, that belongs",
    "forever to others, to something",
    "outside themselves, and the fear, the hatred",
    "of one pariah for another, this brawl",
    "of lost souls, of new slaves. The Great",
    "Drinker of Beer, the Woman Staring into Space,",
    "Mazinger Z: these were my traveling companions.",
    "Who knows what Anna Brichtova dreamed about,",
    "or what you're dreaming now, or how",
    "you children see the world. Will you find,",
    "among your games, the game that saves us?",
    "It's what we all are hoping",
    "as we watch you sleep."
