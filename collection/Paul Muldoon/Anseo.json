    "When the Master was calling the roll",
    "At the primary school in Collegelands,",
    "You were meant to call back",
    "And raise your hand",
    "As your name occurred.",
    ", meaning here, here and now,",
    "All present and correct,",
    "Was the first word of Irish I spoke.",
    "The last name on the ledger",
    "Belonged to Joseph Mary Plunkett Ward",
    "And was followed, as often as not,",
    "By silence, knowing looks,",
    "A nod and a wink, the Master's droll",
    "'And where's our little Ward-of-court?'",
    "I remember the first time he came back",
    "The Master had sent him out",
    "Along the hedges",
    "To weigh up for himself and cut",
    "A stick with which he would be beaten.",
    "After a while, nothing was spoken;",
    "He would arrive as a matter of course",
    "With an ash-plant, a salley-rod.",
    "Or, finally, the hazel-wand",
    "He had whittled down to a whip-lash,",
    "Its twist of red and yellow lacquers",
    "Sanded and polished,",
    "And altogether so delicately wrought",
    "That he had engraved his initials on it.",
    "I last met Joseph Mary Plunkett Ward",
    "In a pub just over the Irish border.",
    "He was living in the open,",
    "In a secret camp",
    "On the other side of the mountain.",
    "He was fighting for Ireland,",
    "Making things happen.",
    "And he told me, Joe Ward,",
    "Of how he had risen through the ranks",
    "To Quartermaster, Commandant:",
    "How every morning at parade",
    "His volunteers would call back",
    "And raise their hands",
    "As their names occurred."
