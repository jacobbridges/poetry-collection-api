    "They've been so long above it all,",
    "those two petals",
    "so steeped in style they seem to stall",
    "in the kettle",
    "simmering over the town dump",
    "or, better still,",
    "the neon-flashed, X-rated rump",
    "of fresh roadkill",
    "courtesy of the interstate",
    "that Eisenhower",
    "would overtake in the home straight",
    "by one horsepower,",
    "the kettle where it all boils down",
    "to the thick scent",
    "of death, a scent of such renown",
    "it's given vent",
    "to the idea buzzards can spot",
    "a deer carcass",
    "a mile away, smelling the rot",
    "as, once, Marcus",
    "Aurelius wrinkled his nose",
    "at a gas leak",
    "from the Great Sewer that ran through Rome",
    "to the Tiber",
    "then went searching out, through the gloam,",
    "one subscriber",
    "to the other view that the rose,",
    "full-blown, antique,",
    "its no-frills ruff, the six-foot shrug",
    "of its swing-wings,",
    "the theologian's and the thug's",
    "twin triumphings",
    "in a buzzard's shaved head and snood,",
    "buzz-buzz-buzzy,",
    "its logic in all likelihood",
    "somewhat fuzzy,",
    "would ever come into focus,",
    "it ever deign",
    "to dispense its hocus-pocus",
    "in that same vein",
    "as runs along an inner thigh",
    "to where, too right,",
    "the buzzard vouchsafes not to shy",
    "away from shite,",
    "its mission not to give a miss",
    "to a b\u00eate noire,",
    "all roly-poly, full of piss",
    "and vinegar,",
    "trying rather to get to grips",
    "with the grommet",
    "of the gut, setting its tinsnips",
    "to that grommet",
    "in the spray-painted hind's hindgut",
    "and making a",
    "sweeping, too right, a sweeping cut",
    "that's so blas\u00e9",
    "it's hard to imagine, dear Sis,",
    "why others shrink",
    "from this sight of a soul in bliss,",
    "so in the pink",
    "from another month in the red",
    "of the shambles,",
    "like a rose in over its head",
    "among brambles,",
    "unflappable in its belief",
    "it's Ararat",
    "on which the Ark would come to grief,",
    "abjuring that",
    "Marcus Aurelius humbug",
    "about what springs",
    "from earth succumbing to the tug",
    "at its heartstrings,",
    "reported to live past fifty,",
    "as you yet may,",
    "dear Sis, perhaps growing your hair",
    "in requital,",
    "though briefly, of whatever tears",
    "at your vitals,",
    "learning, perhaps, from the nifty,",
    "nay",
    ", way",
    "these buzzards are given to stoop",
    "and take their ease",
    "by letting their time-chastened poop",
    "fall to their knees",
    "till they're almost as bright with lime",
    "as their night roost,",
    "their poop containing an enzyme",
    "that's known to boost",
    "their immune systems, should they prong",
    "themselves on small",
    "bones in a cerebral cortex,",
    "at no small cost",
    "to their well-being, sinking fast",
    "in a deer crypt,",
    "buzzards getting the hang at last",
    "of being stripped",
    "of their command of the vortex",
    "while having lost",
    "their common touch, they've been so long",
    "above it all."
