    "I could still hear the musicians",
    "cajoling those thousands of clay",
    "horses and horsemen through the squeeze",
    "when I woke beside Carlotta.",
    "Life-size, also. Also terra-cotta.",
    "The sky was still a terra-cotta frieze",
    "over which her grandfather still held sway",
    "with the set square, fretsaw, stencil,",
    "plumb line, and carpenter's pencil",
    "grandfather brought from Roma.",
    "Proud-fleshed Carlotta. Hypersarcoma.",
    "For now our highest ambition",
    "was simply to bear the light of the day",
    "we had once been planning to seize.",
    "Baginbun",
    "The Nashville skyline's hem and haw",
    "as the freebooters who freeboot",
    "through their contractual mire and murk,",
    "like Normans stampeding dozens",
    "of cows into their Norse-Irish cousins,",
    "were balking now at this massive breastwork",
    "they themselves had thrown up. The pile of toot",
    "on a mirror. The hip-hirple",
    "of a white horse against purple.",
    "Age-old traductions I could trace",
    "from freebasers pretending they freebase",
    "to this inescapable flaw",
    "hidden by Carlotta's close-knit wet suit",
    "like a heart-wound by a hauberk.",
    "Bannockburn",
    "Though he was mounted on a cob",
    "rather than a warhorse, the Bruce",
    "still managed to sidestep a spear",
    "from Henry de Bohun and tax",
    "de Bohun's poll with his broad-based poleax",
    "and leave de Bohun's charger somewhat leer.",
    "Her grandfather had yet to find a use",
    "for the two-timing partisan",
    "his grandfather brought man-to-man",
    "against all those Ferdinandies",
    "until he saw it might come in handy",
    "for whacking the thingammybobs",
    "off pine and fir, off pine and fir and spruce",
    "and all such trees as volunteer.",
    "Berwick-Upon-Tweed",
    "Off the elm, the ancient pollard",
    "that a Flemish painter might love,",
    "that comes to shun the attention",
    "of its headstrong days, so is proof",
    "against the storm that takes its neighbor's roof.",
    "Her",
    "collects his pension",
    "knowing that when push really came to shove",

    "Blaye",
    "Her wet suit like a coat of mail",
    "worn by a French knight from the time",
    "a knight could still cause a ruction",
    "by direct-charging his rouncy,",
    "when an Englishman's home was his bouncy",
    "castle, when abduction and",
    "duction",
    "went hand in glove. Now Carlotta would climb",
    "from the hotel pool in Nashville,",
    "take off her mask, and set a spill",
    "to a Gauloise as one might set",
    "a spill to the fuse of a falconet",
    "and the walls of her chest assail.",
    "The French, meanwhile, were still struggling to prime",
    "their weapons of mass destruction.",
    "Bosworth Field",
    "It was clear now, through the pell-mell",
    "of bombard- and basilisk-mist,",
    "that the Stanleys had done the dirt",
    "on him and taken Henry's side.",
    "Now Richard's very blood seemed to have shied",
    "away from him, seemed to sputter and spurt",
    "like a falcon sheering off from his wrist",
    "as he tried to distance himself",
    "from the same falchioneer who'd pelf",
    "the crown from his blood-matted brow",
    "and hang it in a tree. Less clear was how",
    "he'd managed not to crack the shell",
    "of the pigeon egg the size of a cyst",
    "he'd held so close inside his shirt",
    "Blackwater Fort",
    "As I had held Carlotta close",
    "that night we watched some Xenophon",
    "embedded with the 5th Marines",
    "in the old Sunni Triangle",
    "make a half-assed attempt to untangle",
    "the ghastly from the price of gasoline.",
    "There was a distant fanfaron",
    "in the Nashville sky, where the wind",

    "bearing Scots determined to put manners",
    "on the beech mast- and cress- and hazelnut-",
    "eating Irish. However jerry-built,",
    "those chevaux-de-frise have embogged",
    "the horses whose manes they had hogged",
    "so lovingly and decked with knots",
    "of heather, horses rooted to the spots",
    "on which they go down on their knees",
    "as they unwind their shoulder plaids and kilts,",
    "the checkered careers of their guts.",
    "Boyne",
    "The blood slick from the horse slaughter",
    "I could no longer disregard",

    "My putting her through her paces",
    "as she kicked and kicked against the traces",
    "like a pack mule kicking from a yardarm",
    "before it fell, heehaw, in the dockyard.",
    "A banner's frittering tassel",
    "or deflating bouncy castle",
    "was something to which she paid heed",

    "drinking from a tub of water",
    "and breathing hard, breathing a little hard,",
    "had barely set off an alarm.",
    "Blenheim",
    "Small birds were sounding the alert",
    "as I followed her unladen",
    "steed through a dell so dark and dank",
    "she might have sported the waders",
    "her grandfather had worn at the nadir",
    "of his career, scouring the Outer Banks",
    "for mummichog and menhaden.",
    "Those weeks and months in the doldrums",
    "coming back as he ran his thumb",
    "along an old venetian blind",
    "in the hope that something might come to mind,",
    "that he might yet animadvert",
    "the maiden name of that Iron Maiden",
    "on which he was drawing a blank.",

    "set to my bleeding bough, heehaw.",
    "Her grandfather sterilizing his saw",
    "in a tub of 100-proof firewater,",
    "a helper standing by to stanch",
    "the bleeding in some afterlife.",
    "No looking daggers at the knife.",

    "I crouched in my own Little Ease",
    "by the pool at the Vanderbilt",
    "where Carlotta crouched, sputter-sput,",
    "just as she had in the scanner",
    "when the nurse, keen-sighted as a lanner,",
    "picked out a tumor like a rabbit scut",
    "on dark ground. It was as if a fine silt,",
    "white sand or silicate, had clogged",
    "her snorkel, her goggles had fogged,",
    "and Carlotta surfaced like flot",
    "to be skimmed off some great cast-iron pot",
    "as garble is skimmed off, or lees",
    "painstakingly drained by turnings and tilts",
    "from a man-size barrel or butt.",

    "Attention. Shun. Attention. Shun. Shun. Shun.",
    "We lay in a siding between two rails",

    "to drink from an iron-hooped tub",
    "with the snore-snort of a tuba.",
