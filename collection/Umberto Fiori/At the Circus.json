    "from cotton-candy calf muscles,",
    "the White Clown ushers his",

    "opens a heart-shaped mouth, inhales\u2014",

    "a blast like a trumpeting elephant:",

    "and piss and mint. His gaze fixed",
    "on the clash between the welled tears",
    "and the awful laughing shoes,",
    "the little boy grows",
    "ever more grave, ever more severe."
