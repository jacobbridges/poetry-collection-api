    "Grief dies like joy; the tears upon my cheek",
    "Will disappear like dew. Dear God! I know",
    "Thy kindly Providence hath made it so,",
    "And thank thee for the law. I am too weak",
    "To make a friend of Sorrow, or to wear,",
    "With that dark angel ever by my side",
    "(Though to thy heaven there be no better guide),",
    "A front of manly calm. Yet, for I hear",
    "How woe hath cleansed, how grief can deify,",
    "So weak a thing it seems that grief should die,",
    "And love and friendship with it, I could pray,",
    "That if it might not gloom upon my brow,",
    "Nor weigh upon my arm as it doth now,",
    "No grief of mine should ever pass away."
