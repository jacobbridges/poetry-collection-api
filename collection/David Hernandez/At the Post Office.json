    "The line is long, processional, glacial,",
    "and the attendant a giant stone, cobalt blue",
    "with flecks of white, I\u2019m not so much",
    "looking at a rock but a slab of night.",
    "The stone asks if anything inside the package",
    "is perishable. When I say no the stone",
    "laughs, muted thunderclap, meaning",
    "everything decays, not just fruit",
    "or cut flowers, but paper, ink, the CD",
    "I burned with music, and my friend",
    "waiting to hear the songs, some little joy",
    "after chemo eroded the tumor. I know flesh",
    "is temporary, and memory a tilting barn",
    "the elements dismantle nail by nail.",
    "I know the stone knows a millennia of rain",
    "and wind will even grind away",
    "his ragged face, and all of this slow erasing",
    "is just a prelude to when the swelling",
    "universe burns out, goes dark, holds",
    "nothing but black holes, the bones of stars",
    "and planets, a vast silence. The stone",
    "is stone-faced. The stone asks how soon",
    "I want the package delivered. As fast",
    "as possible, I say, then start counting the days."
