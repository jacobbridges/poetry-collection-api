    "Some nothing afternoon, no one anywhere,",
    "an early autumn stillness in the air,",
    "the kind of empty day you fill by taking in",
    "the full size of the valley and its layers leading",
    "slowly to the Blue Ridge, the quality of country,",
    "if you stand here long enough, you could stay",
    "for, step into, the way a landscape, even on a wall,",
    "pulls you in, one field at a time, pasture and fall",
    "meadow, high above the harvest, perfect",
    "to the tree line, then spirit clouds and intermittent",
    "sunlit smoky rain riding the tops of the mountains,",
    "though you could walk until it\u2019s dark and not reach those rains\u2014",
    "you could walk the rest of the day into the picture",
    "and not know why, at any given moment, you\u2019re there."
