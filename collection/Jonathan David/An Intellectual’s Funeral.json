    "On such a day we put him in a box",
    "And carried him to that last house, the grave;",
    "All round the people walked upon the streets",
    "Without once thinking that he had gone.",
    "Their hard heels clacked upon the pavement stones.",
    "A voiceless change had muted all his thoughts",
    "To a deep significance we could not know;",
    "And yet we knew that he knew all at last.",
    "We heard with grave wonder the falling clods,",
    "And with grave wonder met the loud day.",
    "The night would come and day, but we had died.",
    "With new green sod the melancholy gate",
    "Was closed and locked, and we went pitiful.",
    "Our clacking heels upon the pavement stones",
    "Did knock and knock for Death to let us in."
