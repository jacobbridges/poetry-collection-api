    "The church knelt heavy",
    "above us as we attended Sunday School,",
    "circled by age group and hunkered",
    "on little wood folding chairs",
    "where we gave our nickels, said",
    "our verses, heard the stories, sang",
    "the solid, swinging songs.",
    "It could have been God above",
    "in the pews, His restless love sifting",
    "with dust from the joists. We little",
    "seeds swelled in the stone cellar, bursting",
    "to grow toward the light.",
    "Maybe it was that I liked how, upstairs, outside,",
    "an avid sun stormed down, burning the sharp-",
    "edged shadows back to their buildings, or",
    "how the winter air knifed",
    "after the dreamy basement.",
    "Maybe the day we learned whatever",
    "would have kept me believing",
    "I was just watching light",
    "poke from the high, small window",
    "and tilt to the floor where I could make it",
    "a gold strap on my shoe, wrap",
    "my ankle, embrace",
    "any part of me."
