    "The poet is a man who feigns",
    "And feigns so thoroughly, at last",
    "He manages to feign as pain",
    "The pain he really feels,",
    "And those who read what once he wrote",
    "Feel clearly, in the pain they read,",
    "Neither of the pains he felt,",
    "Only a pain they cannot sense.",
    "And thus, around its jolting track",
    "There runs, to keep our reason busy,",
    "The circling clockwork train of ours",
    "That men agree to call a heart."
