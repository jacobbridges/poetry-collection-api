    "Standing aloof in giant ignorance,",
    "Of thee I hear and of the Cyclades,",
    "As one who sits ashore and longs perchance",
    "To visit dolphin-coral in deep seas.",
    "So thou wast blind;\u2014but then the veil was rent,",
    "For Jove uncurtain'd Heaven to let thee live,",
    "And Neptune made for thee a spumy tent,",
    "And Pan made sing for thee his forest-hive;",
    "Aye on the shores of darkness there is light,",
    "And precipices show untrodden green,",
    "There is a budding morrow in midnight,",
    "There is a triple sight in blindness keen;",
    "Such seeing hadst thou, as it once befel",
    "To Dian, Queen of Earth, and Heaven, and Hell."
