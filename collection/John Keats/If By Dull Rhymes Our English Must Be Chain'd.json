    "If by dull rhymes our English must be chain'd,",
    "And, like Andromeda, the Sonnet sweet",
    "Fetter'd, in spite of pained loveliness;",
    "Let us find out, if we must be constrain'd,",
    "Sandals more interwoven and complete",
    "To fit the naked foot of poesy;",
    "Let us inspect the lyre, and weigh the stress",
    "Of every chord, and see what may be gain'd",
    "By ear industrious, and attention meet:",
    "Misers of sound and syllable, no less",
    "Than Midas of his coinage, let us be",
    "Jealous of dead leaves in the bay wreath crown;",
    "So, if we may not let the Muse be free,",
    "She will be bound with garlands of her own."
