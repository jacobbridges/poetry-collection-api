    "Much have I travell'd in the realms of gold,",
    "And many goodly states and kingdoms seen;",
    "Round many western islands have I been",
    "Which bards in fealty to Apollo hold.",
    "Oft of one wide expanse had I been told",
    "That deep-brow'd Homer ruled as his demesne;",
    "Yet did I never breathe its pure serene",
    "Till I heard Chapman speak out loud and bold:",
    "Then felt I like some watcher of the skies",
    "When a new planet swims into his ken;",
    "Or like stout Cortez when with eagle eyes",
    "He star'd at the Pacific\u2014and all his men",
    "Look'd at each other with a wild surmise\u2014",
    "Silent, upon a peak in Darien."
