    "Four Seasons fill the measure of the year;",
    "There are four seasons in the mind of man:",
    "He has his lusty Spring, when fancy clear",
    "Takes in all beauty with an easy span:",
    "He has his Summer, when luxuriously",
    "Spring's honied cud of youthful thought he loves",
    "To ruminate, and by such dreaming high",
    "Is nearest unto heaven: quiet coves",
    "His soul has in its Autumn, when his wings",
    "He furleth close; contented so to look",
    "On mists in idleness\u0097to let fair things",
    "Pass by unheeded as a threshold brook.",
    "He has his Winter too of pale misfeature,",
    "Or else he would forego his mortal nature."
