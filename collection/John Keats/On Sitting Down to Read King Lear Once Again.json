    "O golden-tongued Romance with serene lute!",
    "Fair plumed Syren! Queen of far away!",
    "Leave melodizing on this wintry day,",
    "Shut up thine olden pages, and be mute:",
    "Adieu! for once again the fierce dispute,",
    "Betwixt damnation and impassion'd clay",
    "Must I burn through; once more humbly assay",
    "The bitter-sweet of this Shakespearian fruit.",
    "Chief Poet! and ye clouds of Albion,",
    "Begetters of our deep eternal theme,",
    "When through the old oak forest I am gone,",
    "Let me not wander in a barren dream,",
    "But when I am consumed in the fire,",
    "Give me new Phoenix wings to fly at my desire."
