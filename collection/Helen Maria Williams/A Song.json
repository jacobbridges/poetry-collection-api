    "I",
    "No riches from his scanty store",
    "My lover could impart;",
    "He gave a boon I valued more \u2014",
    "He gave me all his heart!",
    "II",
    "His soul sincere, his generous worth,",
    "Might well this bosom move;",
    "And when I asked for bliss on earth,",
    "I only meant his love.",
    "III",
    "But now for me, in search of gain",
    "From shore to shore he flies;",
    "Why wander riches to obtain,",
    "When love is all I prize?",
    "IV",
    "The frugal meal, the lowly cot",
    "If blest my love with thee!",
    "That simple fare, that humble lot,",
    "Were more than wealth to me.",
    "V",
    "While he the dangerous ocean braves,",
    "My tears but vainly flow:",
    "Is pity in the faithless waves",
    "To which I pour my woe?",
    "VI",
    "The night is dark, the waters deep,",
    "Yet soft the billows roll;",
    "Alas! at every breeze I weep \u2014",
    "The storm is in my soul."
