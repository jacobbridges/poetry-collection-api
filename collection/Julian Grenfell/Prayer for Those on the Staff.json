    "Fighting in mud, we turn to Thee,",
    "In these dread times of battle, Lord.",
    "To keep us safe, if so may be,",
    "From shrapnel, snipers, shell, and sword.",
    "But not on us, for we are men",
    "Of meaner clay, who fight in clay,",
    "but on the Staff, the Upper Ten,",
    "Depends the issue of the Day.",
    "The staff is working with its brains,",
    "While we are sitting in the trench;",
    "The Staff the universe ordains",
    "(subject to Thee and General French).",
    "God help the staff-especially",
    "The young ones, many of them sprung",
    "From our high aristocracy;",
    "Their task is hard, and they are young.",
    "See that his eggs are newly laid,",
    "Not tinged as some of them-with green;",
    "And let no nasty draughts invade",
    "The windows of his Limousine.",
    "When he forgets to buy the bread,",
    "When there are no more minerals,",
    "Preserve his smooth well-oiled head",
    "From wrath of caustic Generals."
