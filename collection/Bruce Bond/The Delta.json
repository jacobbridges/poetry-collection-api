    "If you are going there by foot, prepare",
    "to get wet. You are not you anymore.",
    "You are a girl standing in a pool",
    "of clouds as they catch fire in the distance.",
    "There are laws of heaven and those of place",
    "and those who see the sky in the water,",
    "angels in ashes that are the delta\u2019s now.",
    "They say if you sweep the trash from your house",
    "after dark, you sweep away your luck.",
    "If you are going by foot, bring a stick,",
    "a third leg, and honor the great disorder,",
    "the great broom of waterfowl and songbirds.",
    "Prepare to voodoo your way, best you can,",
    "knowing there is a little water in things",
    "you take for granted, a little charity",
    "and squalor for the smallest forms of life.",
    "Voodoo was always mostly charity.",
    "People forget. If you shake a tablecloth",
    "outside at night, someone in your family",
    "dies. There are laws we make thinking",
    "it was us who made them. We are not us.",
    "We are a floodplain by the Mississippi",
    "that once poured slaves upriver to the fields.",
    "We are a hurricane in the making.",
    "We could use a magus who knows something",
    "about suffering, who knows a delta\u2019s needs.",
    "We understand if you want a widow",
    "to stay single, cut up her husband\u2019s shoes.",
    "He is not himself anyway and walks",
    "barefoot across a landscape that has no north.",
    "Only a ghost tree here and there, a frog,",
    "a cricket, a bird. And if the fates are kind,",
    "a girl with a stick, who is more at home,",
    "being homeless, than you will ever be."
