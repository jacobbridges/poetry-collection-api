    "You that I loved all my life long,",
    "you are not the one.",
    "You that I followed, my line or path or way,",
    "that I followed singing, and you",
    "earth and air of the world the way went through,",
    "and you who stood around it so it could be",
    "the way, you forests and cities,",
    "you deer and opossums struck by the lonely hunter",
    "and left decaying, you paralyzed obese ones",
    "who sat on a falling porch in a deep green holler",
    "and observed me, your bald dog barking,",
    "as I stumbled past in a hurry along my line,",
    "you are not the one. But you",
    "are the one, you that I loved all my life long,",
    "you I still love so in my dying mind",
    "I grasp me loving you when we are gone.",
    "You are the one, you path or way or line",
    "that winds beside the house where she and I live on,",
    "still longing though long gone",
    "for the health of all forests and cities,",
    "and one day to visit them,",
    "one day be rich and free enough to go and see",
    "the restricted wonders of the earth.",
    "And you are the one, old ladies fated from birth",
    "to ugliness, obesity and dearth,",
    "who sat beside my path",
    "one day as I flashed by. And you are the one,",
    "all tumble-down shacks in disregarded hills",
    "and animals the car on the road kills",
    "and leaves stinking in the sun."
