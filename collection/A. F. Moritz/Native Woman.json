    "Her hair back from the wide round face",
    "flows, almost a girl\u2019s, so thick,",
    "caught back in combs, racing",
    "and curling through them with blackest",
    "vigor, although it is pure white.",
    "Cracked face, dusk-colored: not red",
    "but with a deep red struggling under",
    "the coming night. The eyes shift quickly,",
    "the subway train jerks and rattles,",
    "green vinyl, light flickering, silver poles.",
    "Eyes driven from ancient calm,",
    "which may fear but is never frantic",
    "and says nothing, such as looks out",
    "from the old Indian portraits\u2014calm is",
    "the one thing missing from the beauty",
    "of her face in the black window.",
    "Those unresting eyes there",
    "talk plainly: there\u2019s no money",
    "at home, men young and old go wrong,",
    "life almost at its end is",
    "still day by day harried and perplexed."
