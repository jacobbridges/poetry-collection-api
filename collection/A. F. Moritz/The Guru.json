    "Here comes the wise man in the story of sick times,",
    "telling you how to find the passage of satisfaction.",
    "He is many million years old and has been walking",
    "many thousand miles, more miles, more lengths of road",
    "than the shrunk-up earth of these days possesses,",
    "to find you. He has a veda from before creation",
    "to sing you and, lo and behold, it is about you,",
    "it means everything to you. Though they\u2019ve made a rope",
    "out of rough, heavy smoke, like a whale-thick hawser",
    "for a steamer of dead star, and pulled it through you",
    "from throat to crotch, from ear to ear, and hag-tied",
    "your hands and feet with the ends, though each of them",
    "has your own face molten with leprosy,",
    "though your brain makes the sound of crowded trains",
    "colliding in Kashmir and a stadium that roars hosanna,",
    "it is still possible now, in the next moment, to know God.",
    "That is, not die in confusion. But maybe, then, this guru",
    "is too soon. Maybe he hasn\u2019t come from far enough.",
    "Maybe he\u2019s still much too young. Maybe he\u2019s never",
    "asked himself clearly what happens when someone like you",
    "hears that a lightning-opened living fig tree or a mountain",
    "and a blue sky can be lived in and sets out",
    "on the long road never moving from his realm in pain."
