    "Never anymore in a wash of sweetness and awe",
    "does the summer when I was seventeen come back",
    "to mind against my will, like a bird crossing",
    "my vision. Summer of moist nights full of girls",
    "and boys ripened, holy drunkenness and violation",
    "of the comic boundaries, defiances that never",
    "failed or brought disaster. Days on the backs",
    "and in the breath of horses, between rivers",
    "and pools that reflected the cicadas' whine,",
    "enervation and strength creeping in smooth waves",
    "over muscular water. All those things accepted,",
    "once, with unnoticing hunger, as an infant",
    "accepts the nipple, never come back to mind",
    "against the will. What comes unsummoned now,",
    "blotting out every other thought and image,",
    "is a part of the past not so deep or far away:",
    "the time of poverty, of struggle to find means",
    "not hateful\u2014the muddy seedtime of early manhood.",
    "What returns are those moments in the diner",
    "night after night with each night's one cup of coffee,",
    "watching an old man, who always at the same hour",
    "came in and smiled, ordered his tea and opened",
    "his drawing pad. What did he fill it with?",
    "And where's he gone? Those days, that studious worker,",
    "hand moving and eyes eager in the sour light,",
    "that artist always in the same worn-out suit,",
    "are my nostalgia now. That old man comes back,",
    "the friend I saw each day and never spoke to,",
    "because I hoped soon to disappear from there,",
    "as I have disappeared, into the heaven of better days."
