    "Stiff, thick: the white hair of the broad-faced father,",
    "who leads his shambling son along",
    "cracked sidewalks, by dusty glass half hiding",
    "goods never sold. The son is the taller one",
    "but still a child: not aware of his clothes,",
    "of what expressions seize on his soft face.",
    "His gait lolls, loosely directed from some weak,",
    "distant center, scarcely devoted to any purpose",
    "but following along and looking. Thick lenses glint",
    "with watery blue: his small eyes, veiled",
    "and placid, as far off as the milky August sky.",
    "The father, all the time glancing at him and talking",
    "as man to man, seems to forget it would be better",
    "for this one to have been like all the rest.",
    "He has his son still with him, the others",
    "have grown up and gone away\u2014but when he dies,",
    "then what will happen to the boy? Even this thought",
    "is absorbed now in their ordinary errand,",
    "men\u2019s business: grateful going out through the day,",
    "talk with the owners, the salesmen, a mechanic",
    "in the scent of grease and sawdust of machined metal,",
    "the sifting through tools and parts that flow, spill, gleam",
    "like seeds, like sand\u2014looking for what fits,",
    "finding what will work. Afterwards to stop for food,",
    "then walk back home down the clear streets, when starlings,",
    "hunting and restless before sleep, and children",
    "are the loudest things, with the dark foaming",
    "among maples, glinting, as it comes in."
