    "Child",
    "one with the sun",
    "in trackless fields",
    "of yellow grass and thistle, scent",
    "of humid heavy air and the wing music",
    "of bees and flies.",
    "Child, slender",
    "nakedness to itself unknown,",
    "true colour of the light",
    "dispersed invisibly",
    "or glowing around the black hulls",
    "of distant thunderheads, around",
    "the grasshopper\u2019s countenance,",
    "solemn, vigilant and wise.",
    "Green apples, poured full",
    "of density, of crispness, float unmoved",
    "under leaves on the slope. Brown",
    "fallen apples nest",
    "in secret whorls of grass. The apple tree:",
    "alone in so much space. And below",
    "in the woods by the water",
    "a sweet dead branch",
    "cracks lightly",
    "in the shadow in the wind.",
    "But here is an old track",
    "through the grass head-high",
    "to a child: who",
    "made it? They must have",
    "passed and passed by this one tree,",
    "by the abandoned, tireless car",
    "where rabbits peer out, and the circle",
    "of black embers,",
    "cans, springs, skeletons",
    "of furniture. They too",
    "passed here many times",
    "on their way from the street\u2019s end",
    "to the oaks that screen",
    "the river. There",
    "the sun is nesting now, night",
    "rises with pale flutterings",
    "of white wings from roots",
    "of plants and the black water."
