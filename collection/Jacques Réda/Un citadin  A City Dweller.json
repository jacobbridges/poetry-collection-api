    "The street I walk along I often see",
    "As if I'd long since left the moving surface",
    "Of the world for the endless other side that disperses",
    "Us all some day without return but free",
    "Of care. I apply myself so well to this fragile proceeding",
    "That very quickly my gaze ceases to be",
    "Part of the cloudy clump of hope and memory",
    "I'll have given my name to. But for this to succeed,",
    "A feeling of absolute happiness has to make",
    "Itself felt, as if from outside me, so much",
    "That at that moment the very street has a hunch",
    "That it, the entire city, and its uncertain space",
    "Have become one with the mobile but faithful pattern",
    "Of phrases written by our steps when we move about.",
    "I no longer know who's walking and marking out",
    "The ground, bit by bit, to the corner. My gaze then patterns",
    "Itself on tomorrow's unknown eyes, which will shine",
    "When from the roofs, posthumous and vague, mine glow,",
    "And my invisible trace on the asphalt below",
    "Might guide the \u00e9lan of hardier passersby.",
    "Will they know what I sometimes suspect: what appears",
    "To be the distracted gaze with which we see",
    "The world is the world itself?\u2014It sees and hears",
    "Itself through the thin transparency of our screens."
