    "Back in a yard where ringers groove a ditch,",
    "These four in shirtsleeves congregate to pitch",
    "Dirt-burnished iron. With appraising eye,",
    "One sizes up a peg, hoists and lets fly\u2014",
    "A clang resounds as though a smith had struck",
    "Fire from a forge. His first blow, out of luck,",
    "Rattles in circles. Hitching up his face,",
    "He swings, and weight once more inhabits space,",
    "Tumbles as gently as a new-laid egg.",
    "Extended iron arms surround their peg",
    "Like one come home to greet a long-lost brother.",
    "Shouts from one outpost. Mutters from the other.",
    "Now changing sides, each withered pitcher moves",
    "As his considered dignity behooves",
    "Down the worn path of earth where August flies",
    "And sheaves of air in warm distortions rise,",
    "To stand ground, fling, kick dust with all the force",
    "Of shoes still hammered to a living horse."
