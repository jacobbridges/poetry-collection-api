    "On a slab of Jurassic shale, an ovate",
    "body, legs fine as eyelashes,",
    "the mayfly's precise signature,",
    "consummate, immortal.",
    "Now its descendents, in a tumult",
    "of mating, roil the air on Koerner's",
    "sluggish creek below the hill",
    "where the Ebenezer Baptist church,",
    "its doors agape, declines daily",
    "into dust and rubble.",
    "Beyond the church, the graveyard",
    "encroached by nightshade",
    "and nettle, its stones listing",
    "or broken or gone, a few bearing",
    "words now scarcely visible:",
    "A million years from now the stricken",
    "stones will be scoured clean",
    "and ephemerids will rise each spring",
    "to dance above the clouded waters."
