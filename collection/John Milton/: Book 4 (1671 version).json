    "PErplex'd and troubl'd at his bad success",
    "The Tempter stood, nor had what to reply,",
    "Discover'd in his fraud, thrown from his hope,",

    "In cunning, over-reach't where least he thought,",
    "To salve his credit, and for very spight",
    "Still will be tempting him who foyls him still,",
    "And never cease, though to his shame the more;",
    "Or as a swarm of flies in vintage time,",
    "About the wine-press where sweet moust is powr'd,",
    "Beat off, returns as oft with humming sound;",
    "Or surging waves against a solid rock,",
    "Though all to shivers dash't, the assault renew,",
    "Vain battry, and in froth or bubbles end;",
    "So Satan, whom repulse upon repulse",
    "Met ever; and to shameful silence brought,",
    "Yet gives not o're though desperate of success,",
    "And his vain importunity pursues.",
    "He brought our Saviour to the western side",
    "Of that high mountain, whence he might behold",
    "Another plain, long but in bredth not wide;",
    "Wash'd by the Southern Sea, and on the North",
    "To equal length back'd with a ridge of hills",

    "Divided by a river, of whose banks",
    "On each side an Imperial City stood,",

    "To worship thee accurst, now more accurst",
    "For this attempt bolder then that on Eve,",
    "And more blasphemous? which expect to rue.",

    "As dangerous to the pillard frame of Heaven,",
    "Or to the Earths dark basis underneath,",
    "Are to the main as inconsiderable,",
