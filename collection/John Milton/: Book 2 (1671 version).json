    "But Cottage, Herd or Sheep-cote none he saw,",
    "Only in a bottom saw a pleasant Grove,",
    "With chaunt of tuneful Birds resounding loud;",
    "Thither he bent his way, determin'd there",
    "To rest at noon, and entr'd soon the shade",

    "That open'd in the midst a woody Scene,",
    "Natures own work it seem'd (Nature taught Art)",
    "And to a Superstitious eye the haunt",
    "Of Wood-Gods and Wood-Nymphs; he view'd it round,",
    "When suddenly a man before him stood,",
    "Not rustic as before, but seemlier clad,",
    "As one in City, or Court, or Palace bred,",
    "And with fair speech these words to him address'd.",
    "With granted leave officious I return,",
    "But much more wonder that the Son of God",
    "In this wild solitude so long should bide",
    "Of all things destitute, and well I know,",
    "Not without hunger. Others of some note,",
    "As story tells, have trod this Wilderness;",

    "They all had need, I as thou seest have none.",
    "How hast thou hunger then? Satan reply'd,",
    "Tell me if Food were now before thee set,",
    "Would'st thou not eat? Thereafter as I like",
    "The giver, answer'd Jesus. Why should that",
    "Cause thy refusal, said the subtle Fiend,",
    "Hast thou not right to all Created things,",
    "Owe not all Creatures by just right to thee",

    "From all the Elements her choicest store",
    "To treat thee as beseems, and as her Lord",
    "With honour, only deign to sit and eat.",
    "He spake no dream, for as his words had end,",
    "Our Saviour lifting up his eyes beheld",
    "In ample space under the broadest shade",
    "A Table richly spred, in regal mode,",

    "When on his shoulders each mans burden lies;",
    "For therein stands the office of a King,",
    "His Honour, Vertue, Merit and chief Praise,",
    "That for the Publick all this weight he bears.",
    "Yet he who reigns within himself, and rules",
    "Passions, Desires, and Fears, is more a King;",
    "Which every wise and vertuous man attains:",
    "And who attains not, ill aspires to rule",
    "Cities of men or head-strong Multitudes,",
    "Subject himself to Anarchy within,",
    "Or lawless passions in him which he serves.",
    "But to guide Nations in the way of truth",
    "By saving Doctrine, and from errour lead",
    "To know, and knowing worship God aright,",
    "Is yet more Kingly, this attracts the Soul,",
    "Governs the inner man, the nobler part,",
    "That other o're the body only reigns,",
    "And oft by force, which to a generous mind",
    "So reigning can be no sincere delight.",
    "Besides to give a Kingdom hath been thought",
    "Greater and nobler done, and to lay down",
    "Far more magnanimous, then to assume.",
    "Riches are needless then, both for themselves,",
    "And for thy reason why they should be sought,",
    "To gain a Scepter, oftest better miss't."
