    "One day forth walk'd alone, the Spirit leading;",
    "And his deep thoughts, the better to converse",
    "With solitude, till far from track of men,",

    "He entred now the bordering Desert wild,",
    "And with dark shades and rocks environ'd round,",
    "His holy Meditations thus persu'd.",

    "Ill sorting with my present state compar'd.",

    "Made it my whole delight, and in it grew",
    "To such perfection, that e're yet my age",
    "Had measur'd twice six years, at our great Feast",
    "I went into the Temple, there to hear",
    "The Teachers of our Law, and to propose",

    "Till truth were freed, and equity restor'd:",
    "Yet held it more humane, more heavenly first",
    "By winning words to conquer willing hearts,",
    "And make perswasion do the work of fear;",
    "At least to try, and teach the erring Soul",
    "Not wilfully mis-doing, but unware",
    "Misled; the stubborn only to destroy.",
    "These growing thoughts my Mother soon perceiving",
    "By words at times cast forth inly rejoyc'd,",
    "And said to me apart, high are thy thoughts",
    "O Son, but nourish them and let them soar",
    "To what highth sacred vertue and true worth",
    "Can raise them, though above example high;",
    "By matchless Deeds express thy matchless Sire.",

    "And told them the Messiah now was born,",

    "To honour thee with Incense, Myrrh, and Gold,",
    "By whose bright course led on they found the place,",

    "By Vision, found thee in the Temple, and spake",
    "Before the Altar and the vested Priest,",
    "Like things of thee to all that present stood.",
    "This having heard, strait I again revolv'd",
    "The Law and Prophets, searching what was writ",
    "Concerning the Messiah, to our Scribes",
    "Known partly, and soon found of whom they spake",
    "I am; this chiefly, that my way must lie",
    "Through many a hard assay even to the death,",
    "E're I the promis'd Kingdom can attain,",
    "Or work Redemption for mankind, whose sins",
    "Full weight must be transferr'd upon my head.",
    "Yet neither thus disheartn'd or dismay'd,",
    "The time prefixt I waited, when behold",
    "The Baptist, (of whose birth I oft had heard,",
    "Not knew by sight) now come, who was to come",
    "Before Messiah and his way prepare.",
    "I as all others to his Baptism came,",
    "Which I believ'd was from above; but he",
    "Strait knew me, and with loudest voice proclaim'd",
    "Me him (for it was shew'n him so from Heaven)",
    "Me him whose Harbinger he was; and first",
    "Refus'd on me his Baptism to confer,",
    "As much his greater, and was hardly won;",
    "But as I rose out of the laving stream,",
    "Heaven open'd her eternal doors, from whence",
    "The Spirit descended on me like a Dove,",
    "And last the sum of all, my Father's voice,",
    "Audibly heard from Heav'n, pronounc'd me his,",
    "Me his beloved Son, in whom alone",
    "He was well pleas'd; by which I knew the time",
    "Now full, that I no more should live obscure,",
    "But openly begin, as best becomes",
    "The Authority which I deriv'd from Heaven.",
    "And now by some strong motion I am led",
    "Into this Wilderness, to what intent",
    "I learn not yet, perhaps I need not know;",
    "For what concerns my knowledge God reveals.",
    "So spake our Morning Star then in his rise,",
    "And looking round on every side beheld",
    "A pathless Desert, dusk with horrid shades;",
    "The way he came not having mark'd, return",
    "Was difficult, by humane steps untrod;",
    "And he still on was led, but with such thoughts",
    "Accompanied of things past and to come",
    "Lodg'd in his breast, as well might recommend",
    "Such Solitude before choicest Society.",
    "Full forty days he pass'd, whether on hill",
    "Sometimes, anon in shady vale, each night",
    "Under the covert of some ancient Oak,",
    "Or Cedar, to defend him from the dew,",
    "Or harbour'd in one Cave, is not reveal'd;",
    "Nor tasted humane food, nor hunger felt",
    "Till those days ended, hunger'd then at last",
    "Among wild Beasts: they at his sight grew mild,",
    "Nor sleeping him nor waking harm'd, his walk",
    "The fiery Serpent fled, and noxious Worm,",
    "The Lion and fierce Tiger glar'd aloof.",
    "But now an aged man in Rural weeds,",
    "Following, as seem'd, the quest of some stray Ewe,",
    "Or wither'd sticks to gather; which might serve",
    "Against a Winters day when winds blow keen,",
    "To warm him wet return'd from field at Eve,",
    "He saw approach, who first with curious eye",
    "Perus'd him, then with words thus utt'red spake.",
    "Sir, what ill chance hath brought thee to this place",
    "So far from path or road of men, who pass",
    "In Troop or Caravan, for single none",
    "Durst ever, who return'd, and dropt not here",
    "His Carcass, pin'd with hunger and with droughth?",
    "I ask the rather, and the more admire,",
    "For that to me thou seem'st the man, whom late",
    "Our new baptizing Prophet at the Ford",
    "Of",
    "honour'd so, and call'd thee Son",
    "Of God; I saw and heard, for we sometimes",
    "Who dwell this wild, constrain'd by want, come forth",
    "To Town or Village nigh (nighest is far)",
    "Where ought we hear, and curious are to hear,",
    "What happ'ns new; Fame also finds us out.",
    "To whom the Son of God. Who brought me hither",
    "Will bring me hence, no other Guide I seek.",
    "By Miracle he may, reply'd the Swain,",
    "What other way I see not, for we here",
    "Live on tough roots and stubs, to thirst inur'd",
    "More then the Camel, and to drink go far,",
    "Men to much misery and hardship born;",
    "But if thou be the Son of God, Command",
    "That out of these hard stones be made thee bread;",
    "So shalt thou save thy self and us relieve",
    "With Food, whereof we wretched seldom taste.",
    "He ended, and the Son of God reply'd.",
    "Think'st thou such force in Bread? is it not written",
    "(For I discern thee other then thou seem'st)",
    "Man lives not by Bread only, but each Word",
    "Proceeding from the mouth of God; who fed",
    "Our Fathers here with Manna; in the Mount",
    "was forty days, nor eat nor drank,",
    "And forty days",
    "without food",
    "Wandred this barren waste, the same I now.",
    "Why dost thou then suggest to me distrust,",
    "Knowing who I am, as I know who thou art?",
    "Whom thus answer'd th' Arch Fiend now undisguis'd.",
    "'Tis true, I am that Spirit unfortunate,",
    "Who leagu'd with millions more in rash revolt",
    "Kept not my happy Station, but was driv'n",
    "With them from bliss to the bottomless deep,",
    "Yet to that hideous place not so confin'd",
    "By rigour unconniving, but that oft",
    "Leaving my dolorous Prison I enjoy",
    "Large liberty to round this Globe of Earth,",
    "Or range in th' Air, nor from the Heav'n of Heav'ns",
    "Hath he excluded my resort sometimes.",
    "I came among the Sons of God, when he",
    "Gave up into my hands",
    "To prove him, and illustrate his high worth;",
    "And when to all his Angels he propos'd",
    "To draw the proud King",
    "into fraud",
    "That he might fall in",
    ", they demuring,",
    "I undertook that office, and the tongues",
    "Of all his flattering Prophets glibb'd with lyes",
    "To his destruction, as I had in charge.",
    "For what he bids I do; though I have lost",
    "Much lustre of my native brightness, lost",
    "To be belov'd of God, I have not lost",
    "To love, at least contemplate and admire",
    "What I see excellent in good, or fair,",
    "Or vertuous, I should so have lost all sense.",
    "What can be then less in me then desire",
    "To see thee and approach thee, whom I know",
    "Declar'd the Son of God, to hear attent",
    "Thy wisdom, and behold thy God-like deeds?",
    "Men generally think me much a foe",
    "To all mankind: why should I? they to me",
    "Never did wrong or violence, by them",
    "I lost not what I lost, rather by them",
    "I gain'd what I have gain'd, and with them dwell",
    "Copartner in these Regions of the World,",
    "If not disposer; lend them oft my aid,",
    "Oft my advice by presages and signs,",
    "And answers, oracles, portents and dreams,",
    "Whereby they may direct their future life.",
    "Envy they say excites me, thus to gain",
    "Companions of my misery and wo.",
    "At first it may be; but long since with wo",
    "Nearer acquainted, now I feel by proof,",
    "That fellowship in pain divides not smart,",
    "Nor lightens aught each mans peculiar load.",
    "Small consolation then, were Man adjoyn'd:",
    "This wounds me most (what can it less) that Man,",
    "Man fall'n shall be restor'd, I never more.",
    "To whom our Saviour sternly thus reply'd.",
    "Deservedly thou griev'st, compos'd of lyes",
    "From the beginning, and in lies wilt end;",
    "Who boast'st release from Hell, and leave to come",
    "Into the Heav'n of Heavens; thou com'st indeed,",
    "As a poor miserable captive thrall,",
    "Comes to the place where he before had sat",
    "Among the Prime in Splendour, now depos'd,",
    "Ejected, emptyed, gaz'd, unpityed, shun'd,",
    "A spectacle of ruin or of scorn",
    "To all the Host of Heaven; the happy place",
    "Imparts to thee no happiness, no joy,",
    "Rather inflames thy torment, representing",
    "Lost bliss, to thee no more communicable,",
    "So never more in Hell then when in Heaven.",
    "But thou art serviceable to Heaven's King.",
    "Wilt thou impute to obedience what thy fear",
    "Extorts, or pleasure to do ill excites?",
    "What but thy malice mov'd thee to misdeem",
    "Of righteous",
    ", then cruelly to afflict him",
    "With all inflictions, but his patience won?",
    "The other service was thy chosen task,",
    "To be a lyer in four hundred mouths;",
    "For lying is thy sustenance, thy food.",
    "Yet thou pretend'st to truth; all Oracles",
    "By thee are giv'n, and what confest more true",
    "Among the Nations? that hath been thy craft,",
    "By mixing somewhat true to vent more lyes.",
    "But what have been thy answers, what but dark",
    "Ambiguous and with double sense deluding,",
    "Which they who ask'd have seldom understood,",
    "And not well understood as good not known?",
    "Who ever by consulting at thy shrine",
    "Return'd the wiser, or the more instruct",
    "To flye or follow what concern'd him most,",
    "And run not sooner to his fatal snare?",
    "For God hath justly giv'n the Nations up",
    "To thy Delusions; justly, since they fell",
    "Idolatrous, but when his purpose is",
    "Among them to declare his Providence",
    "To thee not known, whence hast thou then thy truth,",
    "But from him or his Angels President",
    "In every Province, who themselves disdaining",
    "To approach thy Temples, give thee in command",
    "What to the smallest tittle thou shalt say",
    "To thy Adorers; thou with trembling fear,",
    "Or like a Fawning Parasite obey'st;",
    "Then to thy self ascrib'st the truth fore-told.",
    "But this thy glory shall be soon retrench'd;",
    "No more shalt thou by oracling abuse",
    "The Gentiles; henceforth Oracles are ceast,",
    "And thou no more with Pomp and Sacrifice",
    "Shalt be enquir'd at",
    "or elsewhere,",
    "At least in vain, for they shall find thee mute.",
    "God hath now sent his living Oracle",
    "Into the World, to teach his final will,",
    "And sends his Spirit of Truth henceforth to dwell",
    "In pious Hearts, an inward Oracle",
    "To all truth requisite for men to know.",
    "So spake our Saviour; but the subtle Fiend,",
    "Though inly stung with anger and disdain,",
    "Dissembl'd, and this Answer smooth return'd.",
    "Sharply thou hast insisted on rebuke,",
    "And urg'd me hard with doings, which not will",
    "But misery hath rested from me; where",
    "Easily canst thou find one miserable,",
    "And not inforc'd oft-times to part from truth;",
    "If it may stand him more in stead to lye,",
    "Say and unsay, feign, flatter, or abjure?",
    "But thou art plac't above me, thou art Lord;",
    "From thee I can and must submiss endure",
    "Check or reproof, and glad to scape so quit.",
    "Hard are the ways of truth, and rough to walk,",
    "Smooth on the tongue discourst, pleasing to th' ear,",
    "And tuneable as Silvan Pipe or Song;",
    "What wonder then if I delight to hear",
    "Her dictates from thy mouth? most men admire",
    "Vertue, who follow not her lore: permit me",
    "To hear thee when I come (since no man comes)",
    "And talk at least, though I despair to attain.",
    "Thy Father, who is holy, wise and pure,",
    "Suffers the Hypocrite or Atheous Priest",
    "To tread his Sacred Courts, and minister",
    "About his Altar, handling holy things,",
    "Praying or vowing, and vouchsaf'd his voice",
    "To",
    "Reprobate, a Prophet yet",
    "Inspir'd; disdain not such access to me.",
    "To whom our Saviour with unalter'd brow.",
    "Thy coming hither, though I know thy scope,",
    "I bid not or forbid; do as thou find'st",
    "Permission from above; thou canst not more.",
    "He added not; and Satan bowing low",
    "His gray dissimulation, disappear'd",
    "Into thin Air diffus'd: for now began",
    "Night with her sullen wing to double-shade",
    "The Desert, Fowls in thir clay nests were couch't;",
    "And now wild Beasts came forth the woods to roam."
