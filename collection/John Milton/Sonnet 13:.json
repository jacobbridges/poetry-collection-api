    "Harry, whose tuneful and well-measured song",
    "First taught our English music how to span",
    "Words with just note and accent, not to scan",
    "With Midas\u2019 ears, committing short and long,",
    "Thy worth and skill exempts thee from the throng,",
    "With praise enough for Envy to look wan;",
    "To after-age thou shalt be writ the man",
    "That with smooth air couldst humor best our tongue.",
    "Thou honor\u2019st Verse, and Verse must lend her wing",
    "To honor thee, the priest of Ph\u0153bus\u2019 choir,",
    "That tun\u2019st their happiest lines in hymn or story.",
    "Dante shall give Fame leave to set thee higher",
    "Than his Casella, whom he wooed to sing,",
    "Met in the milder shades of Purgatory."
