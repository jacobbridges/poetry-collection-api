    "When I consider how my light is spent,",
    "Ere half my days, in this dark world and wide,",
    "And that one Talent which is death to hide",
    "Lodged with me useless, though my Soul more bent",
    "To serve therewith my Maker, and present",
    "My true account, lest he returning chide;",
    "\u201cDoth God exact day-labour, light denied?\u201d",
    "I fondly ask. But patience, to prevent",
    "That murmur, soon replies, \u201cGod doth not need",
    "Either man\u2019s work or his own gifts; who best",
    "Bear his mild yoke, they serve him best. His state",
    "Is Kingly. Thousands at his bidding speed",
    "And post o\u2019er Land and Ocean without rest:",
    "They also serve who only stand and wait.\u201d"
