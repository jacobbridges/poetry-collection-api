    "Blest pair of Sirens, pledges of Heav'ns joy,",
    "Sphear-born harmonious Sisters, Voice, and Vers,",
    "Wed your divine sounds, and mixt power employ",
    "Dead things with inbreath'd sense able to pierce,",
    "And to our high-rais'd phantasie present,",
    "That undisturb\u00e8d Song of pure content,",
    "Ay sung before the saphire-colour'd throne",
    "To him that sits theron",
    "With Saintly shout, and solemn Jubily,",
    "Where the bright Seraphim in burning row",
    "Their loud up-lifted Angel trumpets blow,",
    "And the Cherubick host in thousand quires",
    "Touch their immortal Harps of golden wires,",
    "With those just Spirits that wear victorious Palms,",
    "Hymns devout and holy Psalms",
    "Singing everlastingly;",
    "That we on Earth with undiscording voice",
    "May rightly answer that melodious noise;",
    "As once we did, till disproportion'd sin",
    "Jarr'd against natures chime, and with harsh din",
    "Broke the fair musick that all creatures made",
    "To their great Lord, whose love their motion sway\u2019d",
    "In perfect Diapason, whilst they stood",
    "In first obedience, and their state of good.",
    "O may we soon again renew that Song",
    "And keep in tune with Heav'n, till God ere long",
    "To his celestial consort us unite,",
    "To live with him, and sing in endles morn of light."
