    "Next to the screen door",
    "work boots dry in the sun.",
    "Salt lines map the leather",
    "and laces droop",
    "like the arms of a new-hire",
    "waiting to punch out.",
    "The shoe hangs open like the sigh",
    "of someone too tired to speak",
    "a mouth that can almost breathe.",
    "A tear in the leather reveals",
    "a shiny steel toe",
    "a glimpse of the promise of safety",
    "the promise of steel and the years to come."
