    "A sycamore grove, and in its limbs",
    "the orchestra played",
    ", so I saw",
    "boughs bouncing and tuxedo legs",
    "swinging sap-spotted above the splayed",
    "blades of the ground feathered black",
    "in moss, in the sweat of the set sun,",
    "and the players\u2019 faces where moths roosted,",
    "where leaf-points drew water-stripes",
    "on brows and eyelids, their hands",
    "that stirred in pollen like a fog, were masked",
    "by birds\u2019 nests and bows and flaking vines.",
    "That you were last to climb down,",
    "trumpet tied to your back with blue twine,",
    "is the only thing I believe in,",
    "and after you landed, drifting",
    "through a stream, in a mat of orange needles,",
    "you whistled to what light could float",
    "through the leaves\u2019 screen and canopy, diffuse",
    "like tracing tissue, a scrum of benday dots,",
    "and not much at that,",
    "now that more than the concert has ended,",
    "my musician."
