    "This morning, between two branches of a tree",
    "Beside the door, epeira once again",
    "Has spun and signed his tapestry and trap.",
    "I test his early-warning system and",
    "It works, he scrambles forth in sable with",
    "The yellow hieroglyph that no one knows",
    "The meaning of. And I remember now",
    "How yesterday at dusk the nighthawks came",
    "Back as they do about this time each year,",
    "Grey squadrons with the slashes white on wings",
    "Cruising for bugs beneath the bellied cloud.",
    "Now soon the monarchs will be drifting south,",
    "And then the geese will go, and then one day",
    "The little garden birds will not be here.",
    "See how many leaves already have",
    "Withered and turned; a few have fallen, too.",
    "Change is continuous on the seamless web,",
    "Yet moments come like this one, when you feel",
    "Upon your heart a signal to attend",
    "The definite announcement of an end",
    "Where one thing ceases and another starts;",
    "When like the spider waiting on the web",
    "You know the intricate dependencies",
    "Spreading in secret through the fabric vast",
    "Of heaven and earth, sending their messages",
    "Ciphered in chemistry to all the kinds,",
    "The whisper down the bloodstream: it is time."
