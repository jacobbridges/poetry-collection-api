    "By the dry road the fathers cough and spit,",
    "This is their room. They are the ones who hung",
    "That bloody sun upon the southern wall",
    "And crushed the armored beetle to the floor.",
    "The father\u2019s skin is seamed and dry, the map",
    "Of that wild region where they drained the swamp",
    "And set provision out that they might sit,",
    "Of history the cracked precipitate,",
    "Until the glass be shattered and the sun",
    "Descend to burn the prosperous flesh away",
    "Of the filthy world, so vilely fathered on",
    "The fathers, such black cinders, sitting there.",
    "Old pioneers, what lecheries remain?",
    "When schoolgirls pass, what whispers of their skirts,",
    "Cold gleams of flesh, solicit in your veined",
    "And gemlike eyes the custom of desire?",
    "None now. Their eyes are sunk in ancient flesh,",
    "And the sarcastic triumph of the mind",
    "They now enjoy, letting their lust alone",
    "Who may have kin but have no longer kind.",
    "Neither tomorrow\u2019s monstrous tumor nor",
    "The reformation of the past they wish,",
    "Who hold in silent colloquy the world",
    "A shrivelled apple in the hand of God.",
    "They hang at night their somber flags aloft,",
    "And through the amorous dark pursue their theme",
    "Of common images, that sleep may show",
    "Them done with all disasters but the one."
