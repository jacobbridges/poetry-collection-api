    "Earth\u2019s Wrath at our assaults is slow to come",
    "But relentless when it does. It has to do",
    "With catastrophic change, and with the limit",
    "At which one order more of Magnitude",
    "Will bring us to a qualitative change",
    "And disasters drastically different",
    "From those we daily have to know about.",
    "As with the speed of light, where speed itself",
    "Becomes a limit and an absolute;",
    "As with the splitting of the atom",
    "And a little later of the nucleus;",
    "As with the millions rising into billions\u2014",
    "The piker\u2019s kind in terms of money, yes,",
    "But a million",
    "in terms of time and space",
    "As the universe grew vast while the earth",
    "Our habitat diminished to the size",
    "Of a billiard ball, both relative",
    "To the cosmos and to the numbers of ourselves,",
    "The doubling numbers, the earth could accommodate.",
    "We stand now in the place and limit of time",
    "Where hardest knowledge is turning into dream,",
    "And nightmares still contained in sleeping dark",
    "Seem on the point of bringing into day",
    "The sweating panic that starts the sleeper up.",
    "One or another nightmare may come true,",
    "And what to do then? What in the world to do?"
