    "The world is full of mostly invisible things,",
    "And there is no way but putting the mind\u2019s eye,",
    "Or its nose, in a book, to find them out,",
    "Things like the square root of Everest",
    "Or how many times Byron goes into Texas,",
    "Or whether the law of the excluded middle",
    "Applies west of the Rockies. For these",
    "And the like reasons, you have to go to school",
    "And study books and listen to what you are told,",
    "And sometimes try to remember. Though I don\u2019t know",
    "What you will do with the mean annual rainfall",
    "On Plato\u2019s Republic, or the calorie content",
    "Of the Diet of Worms, such things are said to be",
    "Good for you, and you will have to learn them",
    "In order to become one of the grown-ups",
    "Who sees invisible things neither steadily nor whole,",
    "But keeps gravely the grand confusion of the world",
    "Under his hat, which is where it belongs,",
    "And teaches small children to do this in their turn."
