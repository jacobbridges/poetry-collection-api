    "Late in November, on a single night",
    "Not even near to freezing, the ginkgo trees",
    "That stand along the walk drop all their leaves",
    "In one consent, and neither to rain nor to wind",
    "But as though to time alone: the golden and green",
    "Leaves litter the lawn today, that yesterday",
    "Had spread aloft their fluttering fans of light.",
    "What signal from the stars? What senses took it in?",
    "What in those wooden motives so decided",
    "To strike their leaves, to down their leaves,",
    "Rebellion or surrender? and if this",
    "Can happen thus, what race shall be exempt?",
    "What use to learn the lessons taught by time.",
    "If a star at any time may tell us:",
    "."
