    "I had a boyfriend who told me stories about his family,",
    "how an argument once ended when his father",
    "seized a lit birthday cake in both hands",
    "and hurled it out a second-story window. That,",
    "I thought, was what a normal family was like: anger",
    "sent out across the sill, landing like a gift",
    "to decorate the sidewalk below. In mine",
    "it was fists and direct hits to the solar plexus,",
    "and nobody ever forgave anyone. But I believed",
    "the people in his stories really loved one another,",
    "even when they yelled and shoved their feet",
    "through cabinet doors, or held a chair like a bottle",
    "of cheap champagne, christening the wall,",
    "rungs exploding from their holes.",
    "I said it sounded harmless, the pomp and fury",
    "of the passionate. He said it was a curse",
    "being born Italian and Catholic and when he",
    "looked from that window what he saw was the moment",
    "rudely crushed. But all I could see was a gorgeous",
    "three-layer cake gliding like a battered ship",
    "down the sidewalk, the smoking candles broken, sunk",
    "deep in the icing, a few still burning."
