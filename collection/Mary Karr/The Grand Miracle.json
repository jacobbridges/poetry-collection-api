    "Jesus wound up with his body nailed to a tree\u2014",
    "a torment he practically begged for,",
    "or at least did nothing to stop. Pilate",
    "watched the crowd go thumbs down",
    "and weary, signed the order.",
    "So centurions laid Jesus flat",
    "on a long beam, arms run along the crosspiece.",
    "In each palm a long spike was centered,",
    "a stone chosen to drive it. (Skin",
    "tears; the bones start to split.)",
    "Once the cross got propped up,",
    "the body hung heavy, a carcass\u2014",
    "in carne, the Latin poets say, in meat.",
    "(\u2014The breastbone a ship\u2019s prow . . .)",
    "At the end the man cried out",
    "as men cry. (Tears that fill the eyes",
    "grow dark drop and by drop: One",
    "cries out.) On the third day,",
    "the stone rolled back, to reveal",
    "no corpse. History is rife",
    "with such hoaxes. (Look at Herodotus.)",
    "As to whether he multiplied",
    "loaves and fishes, that\u2019s common enough.",
    "Poke seed-corn in a hole and see if more corn",
    "doesn\u2019t grow. Two fish in a pond",
    "make more fishes. The altar of reason",
    "supports such extravagance. (I don\u2019t even know",
    "how electricity works, but put trust",
    "in light switches.) And the prospect",
    "of love cheers me up, as gospel.",
    "That some creator might strap on",
    "an animal mask to travel our path between birth",
    "and ignominious death\u2014now that",
    "makes me less lonely. And the rising up",
    "at the end into glory\u2014the white circle of bread",
    "on the meat of each tongue that God",
    "might enter us. For 2000-near years",
    "my tribe has lined up at various altars,",
    "so dumbly I open this mouth for bread and song."
