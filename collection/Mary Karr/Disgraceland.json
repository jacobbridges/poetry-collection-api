    "Before my first communion, I clung to doubt",
    "as Satan spider-like stalked",
    "the orb of dark surrounding Eden",
    "for a wormhole into paradise.",
    "God had formed me from gel in my mother\u2019s womb,",
    "injected by my dad\u2019s smart shoot.",
    "They swapped sighs until",
    "I came, smaller than a bite of burger.",
    "Quietly, I grew till my lungs were done",
    "then the Lord sailed a soul",
    "like a lit arrow to inhabit me.",
    "Maybe that piercing",
    "made me howl at birth,",
    "or the masked creatures whose scalpel",
    "cut a lightning bolt to free me.",
    "I was hoisted by the heels and swatted, fed",
    "and hauled around. Time-lapse photos show",
    "my fingers grow past crayon outlines,",
    "my feet come to fill spike heels.",
    "Eventually, I lurched out",
    "to kiss the wrong mouths, get stewed,",
    "and sulk around. Christ always stood",
    "to one side with a glass of water.",
    "I swatted the sap away.",
    "When my thirst got great enough to ask,",
    "a clear stream welled up inside,",
    "some jade wave buoyed me forward,",
    "and I found myself upright",
    "in the instant, with a garden",
    "inside my own ribs aflourish.",
    "There, the arbor leafs.",
    "The vines push out plump grapes.",
    "You are loved, someone said. Take that",
    "and eat it."
