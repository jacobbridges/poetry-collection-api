    "On this first dark day of the year",
    "my daddy was born lo",
    "these eighty-six years ago who now",
    "has not drawn breath or held",
    "bodily mass for some ten years and still",
    "I have not got used to it.",
    "My mind can still form to that chair him",
    "whom no chair holds.",
    "Each year on this night on the brink",
    "of new circumference I stand and gaze",
    "towards him, while roads careen with drunks,",
    "and my dad who drank himself",
    "away cannot be found. Daddy, I\u2019m halfway",
    "to death myself. The millenium",
    "hurtles towards me, and the boy I bore",
    "who bears your fire in his limbs",
    "follows in my wake. Why can you not be",
    "reborn all tall to me? If I raise my arms",
    "here in the blind dark, why can you not",
    "reach down now to hoist me up?",
    "This heavy carcass I derive from yours is",
    "tutelage of love, and yet each year",
    "though older another notch I still cannot stand",
    "to reach you, or to emigrate",
    "from the monolithic shadow you left."
