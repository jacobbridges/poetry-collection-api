    "I came awake in kindergarten,",
    "under the letter K chalked neat",
    "on a field-green placard leaned",
    "on the blackboard's top edge. They'd caged me",
    "in a metal",
    "\u2014the dull word writ",
    "to show K's sound. But K meant",
    "and",
    "when a boy I'd kissed drew me",
    "as a whiskered troll in art. On my sheet,",
    "the puffy clouds I made to keep rain in",
    "let torrents dagger loose. \"Screw those",
    "who color in the lines,\" my mom had preached,",
    "words I shared that landed me on a short chair",
    "facing the corner's empty, sheetrock page. Craning up,",
    "I found my K high above.",
    ", its silence said.",
    "And in the surrounding alphabet, my whole life hid\u2014",
    "names of my beloveds, sacred vows I'd break.",
    "With my pencil stub applied to wall,",
    "I moved around the loops and vectors,",
    "Z to A, learning how to mean, how",
    "in the mean world to be.",
    "But while I worked the room around me",
    "began to smudge\u2014like a charcoal sketch my mom",
    "was rubbing with her thumb. Then",
    "the instant went, the month, and every season",
    "smeared, till with a wrenching arm tug",
    "I was here, grown, but still bent",
    "to set down words before the black eraser",
    "swipes our moment into cloud, dispersing all",
    "to zip. And when I blunder in the valley",
    "of the shadow of blank about to break",
    "in half, my being leans against my spinal K,",
    "which props me up, broomstick straight,",
    "a strong bone in the crypt of meat I am."
