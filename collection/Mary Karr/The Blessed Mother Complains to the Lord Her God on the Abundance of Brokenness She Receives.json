    "Today I heard a rich and hungry boy verbatim quote",
    "all last night\u2019s infomercials \u2014 an anorectic son",
    "who bought with Daddy\u2019s Amex black card",
    "the Bowflex machine and Abdomenizer,",
    "plus a steak knife that doth slice",
    "the inner skin of his starving arms.",
    "Poor broken child of Eve myself,",
    "to me, the flightless fly,",
    "the listing, blistered, scalded.",
    "I am the rod to their lightning.",
    "Mine is the earhole their stories pierce.",
    "At my altar the blouse is torn open",
    "and the buttons sailed across",
    "the incensed air space of the nave,",
    "that I may witness the mastectomy scars",
    "crisscrossed like barbed wire, like bandoliers.",
    "To me, the mother carries the ash contents",
    "of the long-ago incinerated girl.",
    "She begs me for comfort since my own son",
    "was worse tortured. Justice,",
    "they wail for \u2014 mercy?",
    "Each prostrate body I hold my arms out for",
    "is a cross my son is nailed to."
