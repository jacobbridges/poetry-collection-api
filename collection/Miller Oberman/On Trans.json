    "The earth doesn\u2019t seem to move, but sometimes we fall",
    "down against it and seem to briefly alight on its turning.",

    "turning, that night and many nights, transcendent.",
    "I felt heat changing me. The word for this is",
    ", but in extreme cases we call it",
    "or when this heat becomes your maker we say",
    ", or when it happens in front of a hearth:",
