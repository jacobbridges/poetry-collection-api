    "one butterfly that has fallen into water, it may be said:",
    "\u201cHe has saved the whole world.\u201d",
    "If one saves a motley moth, is it the same?",
    "Rabbi: It is valid. If one saves a dirty monkey from a flame,",
    "for example, it is as the saying is: He or she has saved the whole world.",
    "It is valid for all creatures, and not more so for the creatures who know",
    "how to recite the blessings. It is always valid, even on the Sabbath.",

    "The Rabbi was silent and seemed troubled. He replied:",
    "If the house of the great teacher is in ruins,",
    "and the garden is a scandal, and one saves",
    "one rose from his garden it is said even",
    "of one rose: It is like saving the world.",
    "It is also said the rose will grow as large as the world."
