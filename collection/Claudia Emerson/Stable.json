    "One rusty horseshoe hangs on a nail",
    "above the door, still losing its luck,",
    "and a work-collar swings, an empty",
    "old noose. The silence waits, wild to be",
    "broken by hoofbeat and heavy",
    "harness slap, will founder but remain;",
    "while, outside, above the stable,",
    "eight, nine, now ten buzzards swing low",
    "in lazy loops, a loose black warp",
    "of patience, bearing the blank sky",
    "like a pall of wind on mourning",
    "wings. But the bones of this place are",
    "long picked clean. Only the hayrake's",
    "ribs still rise from the rampant grasses."
