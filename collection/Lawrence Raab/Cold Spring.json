    "The last few gray sheets of snow are gone,",
    "winter\u2019s scraps and leavings lowered",
    "to a common level. A sudden jolt",
    "of weather pushed us outside, and now",
    "this larger world once again belongs to us.",
    "I stand at the edge of it, beside the house,",
    "listening to the stream we haven\u2019t heard",
    "since fall, and I imagine one day thinking",
    "back to this hour and blaming myself",
    "for my worries, my foolishness, today\u2019s choices",
    "having become the accomplished",
    "facts of change, accepted",
    "or forgotten. The woods are a mangle",
    "of lines, yet delicate, yet precise,",
    "when I take the time to look closely.",
    "If I\u2019m not happy it must be my own fault.",
    "At the edge of the lawn my wife",
    "bends down to uncover a flower, then another.",
    "The first splurge of crocuses.",
    "And for a moment the sweep and shudder",
    "of the wind seems indistinguishable",
    "from the steady furl of water",
    "just beyond her."
