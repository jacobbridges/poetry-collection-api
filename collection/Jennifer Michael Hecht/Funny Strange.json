    "We are tender and our lives are sweet",
    "and they are already over and we are",
    "visiting them in some kind of endless",
    "reprieve from oblivion, we are walking",
    "around in them and after we shatter",
    "with love for everything we settle in.",
    "Thou tiger on television chowing,",
    "thou very fact of dreams, thou majestical",
    "roof fretted with golden fire. Thou wisdom",
    "of the inner parts. Thou tintinnabulation.",
    "Is it not sweet to hand over the ocean's",
    "harvest in a single wave of fish? To bounce",
    "a vineyard of grapes from one's apron",
    "and into the mouth of the crowd? To scoop up",
    "bread and offer up one's armful to the throng?",
    "Let us live as if we were still among",
    "the living, let our days be patterned after",
    "theirs. Is it not marvelous to be forgetful?"
