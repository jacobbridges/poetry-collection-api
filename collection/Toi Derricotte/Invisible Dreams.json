    "There\u2019s a sickness in me. During",
    "the night I wake up & it\u2019s brought",
    "a stain into my mouth, as if",
    "an ocean has risen & left back",
    "a stink on the rocks of my teeth.",
    "I stink. My mouth is ugly, human",
    "stink. A color like rust",
    "is in me. I can\u2019t get rid of it.",
    "It rises after I",
    "brush my teeth, a taste",
    "like iron. In the",
    "night, left like a dream,",
    "a caustic light",
    "washing over the insides of me.",
    "What to do with my arms? They",
    "coil out of my body",
    "like snakes.",
    "They branch & spit.",
    "I want to shake myself",
    "until they fall like withered",
    "roots; until",
    "they bend the right way\u2014",
    "until I fit in them,",
    "or they in me.",
    "I have to lay them down as",
    "carefully as an old wedding dress,",
    "I have to fold them",
    "like the arms of someone dead.",
    "The house is quiet; all",
    "night I struggle. All",
    "because of my arms,",
    "which have no peace!",
    "I\u2019m a martyr, a girl who\u2019s been dead",
    "two thousand years. I turn",
    "on my left side, like one comfortable",
    "after a long, hard death.",
    "The angels look down",
    "tenderly. \u201cShe\u2019s sleeping,\u201d they say",
    "& pass me by. But",
    "all night, I am passing",
    "in & out of my body",
    "on my naked feet.",
    "I\u2019m awake when I\u2019m sleeping & I\u2019m",
    "sleeping when I\u2019m awake, & no one",
    "knows, not even me, for my eyes",
    "are closed to myself.",
    "I think I am thinking I see",
    "a man beside me, & he thinks",
    "in his sleep that I\u2019m awake",
    "writing. I hear a pen scratch",
    "a paper. There is some idea",
    "I think is clever: I want to",
    "capture myself in a book.",
    "I have to make a",
    "place for my body in",
    "my body. I\u2019m like a",
    "dog pawing a blanket",
    "on the floor. I have to",
    "turn & twist myself",
    "like a rag until I",
    "can smell myself in myself.",
    "I\u2019m sweating; the water is",
    "pouring out of me",
    "like silver. I put my head",
    "in the crook of my arm",
    "like a brilliant moon.",
    "The bones of my left foot",
    "are too heavy on the bones",
    "of my right. They",
    "lie still for a little while,",
    "sleeping, but soon they",
    "bruise each other like",
    "angry twins. Then",
    "the bones of my right foot",
    "command the bones of my left",
    "to climb down."
