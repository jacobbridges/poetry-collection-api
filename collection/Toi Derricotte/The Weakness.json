    "That time my grandmother dragged me",
    "through the perfume aisles at Saks, she held me up",
    "by my arm, hissing, \u201cStand up,\u201d",
    "through clenched teeth, her eyes",
    "bright as a dog\u2019s",
    "cornered in the light.",
    "She said it over and over,",
    "as if she were Jesus,",
    "and I were dead. She had been",
    "solid as a tree,",
    "a fur around her neck, a",
    "light-skinned matron whose car was parked, who walked on swirling",
    "marble and passed through",
    "brass openings\u2014in 1945.",
    "There was not even a black",
    "elevator operator at Saks.",
    "The saleswoman had brought velvet",
    "leggings to lace me in, and cooed,",
    "as if in the service of all grandmothers.",
    "My grandmother had smiled, but not",
    "hungrily, not like my mother",
    "who hated them, but wanted to please,",
    "and they had smiled back, as if",
    "they were wearing wooden collars.",
    "When my legs gave out, my grandmother",
    "dragged me up and held me like God",
    "holds saints by the",
    "roots of the hair. I begged her",
    "to believe I couldn\u2019t help it. Stumbling,",
    "her face white",
    "with sweat, she pushed me through the crowd, rushing",
    "away from those eyes",
    "that saw through",
    "her clothes, under",
    "her skin, all the way down",
    "to the transparent",
    "genes confessing."
