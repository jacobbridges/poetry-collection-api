    "These poems, these poems,",
    "these poems, she said, are poems",
    "with no love in them. These are the poems of a man",
    "who would leave his wife and child because",
    "they made noise in his study. These are the poems",
    "of a man who would murder his mother to claim",
    "the inheritance. These are the poems of a man",
    "like Plato, she said, meaning something I did not",
    "comprehend but which nevertheless",
    "offended me. These are the poems of a man",
    "who would rather sleep with himself than with women,",
    "she said. These are the poems of a man",
    "with eyes like a drawknife, with hands like a pickpocket\u2019s",
    "hands, woven of water and logic",
    "and hunger, with no strand of love in them. These",
    "poems are as heartless as birdsong, as unmeant",
    "as elm leaves, which if they love love only",
    "the wide blue sky and the air and the idea",
    "of elm leaves. Self-love is an ending, she said,",
    "and not a beginning. Love means love",
    "of the thing sung, not of the song or the singing.",
    "These poems, she said....",
    "You are, he said,",
    "beautiful.",
    "That is not love, she said rightly."
