    "Love ere he bleeds, an eagle in high skies,",
    "Has earth beneath his wings: from reddened eve",
    "He views the rosy dawn. In vain they weave",
    "The fatal web below while far he flies.",
    "But when the arrow strikes him, there's a change.",
    "He moves but in the track of his spent pain,",
    "Whose red drops are the links of a harsh chain,",
    "Binding him to the ground, with narrow range.",
    "A subtle serpent then has Love become.",
    "I had the eagle in my bosom erst:",
    "Henceforward with the serpent I am cursed.",
    "I can interpret where the mouth is dumb.",
    "Speak, and I see the side-lie of a truth.",
    "Perchance my heart may pardon you this deed:",
    "But be no coward:\u0097you that made Love bleed,",
    "You must bear all the venom of his tooth!"
