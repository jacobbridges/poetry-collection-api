    "A wind sways the pines,",
    "And below",
    "Not a breath of wild air;",
    "Still as the mosses that glow",
    "On the flooring and over the lines",
    "Of the roots here and there.",
    "The pine-tree drops its dead;",
    "They are quiet, as under the sea.",
    "Overhead, overhead",
    "Rushes life in a race,",
    "As the clouds the clouds chase;",
    "And we go,",
    "And we drop like the fruits of the tree,",
    "Even we,",
    "Even so."
