    "In our old shipwrecked days there was an hour,",
    "When in the firelight steadily aglow,",
    "Joined slackly, we beheld the red chasm grow",
    "Among the clicking coals. Our library-bower",
    "That eve was left to us: and hushed we sat",
    "As lovers to whom Time is whispering.",
    "From sudden-opened doors we heard them sing:",
    "The nodding elders mixed good wine with chat.",
    "Well knew we that Life's greatest treasure lay",
    "With us, and of it was our talk. \"Ah, yes!",
    "Love dies!\" I said: I never thought it less.",
    "She yearned to me that sentence to unsay.",
    "Then when the fire domed blackening, I found",
    "Her cheek was salt against my kiss, and swift",
    "Up the sharp scale of sobs her breast did lift:\u0097",
    "Now am I haunted by that taste! that sound!"
