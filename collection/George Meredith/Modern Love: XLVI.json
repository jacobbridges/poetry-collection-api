    "At last we parley: we so strangely dumb",
    "In such a close communion! It befell",
    "About the sounding of the Matin-bell,",
    "And lo! her place was vacant, and the hum",
    "Of loneliness was round me. Then I rose,",
    "And my disordered brain did guide my foot",
    "To that old wood where our first love-salute",
    "Was interchanged: the source of many throes!",
    "There did I see her, not alone. I moved",
    "Toward her, and made proffer of my arm.",
    "She took it simply, with no rude alarm;",
    "And that disturbing shadow passed reproved.",
    "I felt the pained speech coming, and declared",
    "My firm belief in her, ere she could speak.",
    "A ghastly morning came into her cheek,",
    "While with a widening soul on me she stared."
