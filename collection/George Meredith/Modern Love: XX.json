    "I am not of those miserable males",
    "Who sniff at vice and, daring not to snap,",
    "Do therefore hope for heaven. I take the hap",
    "Of all my deeds. The wind that fills my sails",
    "Propels; but I am helmsman. Am I wrecked,",
    "I know the devil has sufficient weight",
    "To bear: I lay it not on him, or fate.",
    "Besides, he's damned. That man I do suspect",
    "A coward, who would burden the poor deuce",
    "With what ensues from his own slipperiness.",
    "I have just found a wanton-scented tress",
    "In an old desk, dusty for lack of use.",
    "Of days and nights it is demonstrative,",
    "That, like some aged star, gleam luridly.",
    "If for those times I must ask charity,",
    "Have I not any charity to give?"
