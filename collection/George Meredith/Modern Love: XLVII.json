    "Their sense is with their senses all mixed in,",
    "Destroyed by subtleties these women are!",
    "More brain, O Lord, more brain! or we shall mar",
    "Utterly this fair garden we might win.",
    "Behold! I looked for peace, and thought it near.",
    "Our inmost hearts had opened, each to each.",
    "We drank the pure daylight of honest speech.",
    "Alas! that was the fatal draught, I fear.",
    "For when of my lost Lady came the word,",
    "This woman, O this agony of flesh!",
    "Jealous devotion bade her break the mesh,",
    "That I might seek that other like a bird.",
    "I do adore the nobleness! despise",
    "The act! She has gone forth, I know not where.",
    "Will the hard world my sentience of her share?",
    "I feel the truth; so let the world surmise."
