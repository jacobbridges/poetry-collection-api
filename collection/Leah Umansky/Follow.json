    "Follow where all is. / Follow the transfused. / Follow what is still and what is still-attracting.",
    "That light / That beauty / That love / That, that is massy-borne and rising up, like a drifting star.",
    "Like stars lift. / Like lifting stars. / Like the lifting of stars, I rose. I rise.",
    "Rose. Rose. Like a thing beyond words: satiated.",
    "Let lie in the ravage. / Let lie in what is ravaged-wrought.",
    "Why fear what hasn\u2019t become?",
    "I beckon, like light. / Like a star, I will beckon. / You will oblige. / You will lend the want. You will eclipse my blinding.",
    "You will know nothing. Nothing. You will know nothing of what has been dark."
