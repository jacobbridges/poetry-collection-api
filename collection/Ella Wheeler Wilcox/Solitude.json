    "Laugh, and the world laughs with you;",
    "Weep, and you weep alone;",
    "For the sad old earth must borrow its mirth,",
    "But has trouble enough of its own.",
    "Sing, and the hills will answer;",
    "Sigh, it is lost on the air;",
    "The echoes bound to a joyful sound,",
    "But shrink from voicing care.",
    "Rejoice, and men will seek you;",
    "Grieve, and they turn and go;",
    "They want full measure of all your pleasure,",
    "But they do not need your woe.",
    "Be glad, and your friends are many;",
    "Be sad, and you lose them all,\u2014",
    "There are none to decline your nectared wine,",
    "But alone you must drink life\u2019s gall.",
    "Feast, and your halls are crowded;",
    "Fast, and the world goes by.",
    "Succeed and give, and it helps you live,",
    "But no man can help you die.",
    "There is room in the halls of pleasure",
    "For a large and lordly train,",
    "But one by one we must all file on",
    "Through the narrow aisles of pain."
