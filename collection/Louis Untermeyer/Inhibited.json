    "I could not pity your pain but I pitied the branches",
    "Losing what little the frost had left them to hold.",
    "I could not warm you with sorrow; I turned to the sparrows,",
    "Clustered like heavy brown blossoms puffed out by the cold.",
    "They could not help me. I looked at my hands; they were helpless;",
    "Strange and detached, less related to me than the birds.",
    "Baffled, I called on the mind: it carried me, floundering,",
    "Lost among meaningless phrases, tossed in a welter of words.",
    "Too great for my blundering comfort, your anguish confused me.",
    "From a great distance, I saw you standing alone.",
    "Frozen and stark, in a black iron circle of silence,",
    "I could not pity your pain; I could scarcely pity my own."
