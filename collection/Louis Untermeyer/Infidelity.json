    "You have not conquered me\u0097it is the surge",
    "Of love itself that beats against my will;",
    "It is the sting of conflict, the old urge",
    "That calls me still.",
    "It is not you I love\u0097it is the form",
    "And shadow of all lovers who have died",
    "That gives you all the freshness of a warm",
    "And unfamiliar bride.",
    "It is your name I breathe, your hands I seek;",
    "It will be you when you are gone.",
    "And yet the dream, the name I never speak,",
    "Is that that lures me on.",
    "It is the golden summons, the bright wave",
    "Of banners calling me anew;",
    "It is all beauty, perilous and grave\u0097",
    "It is not you."
