    "I never knew the earth had so much gold\u0097",
    "The fields run over with it, and this hill",
    "Hoary and old,",
    "Is young with buoyant blooms that flame and thrill.",
    "Such golden fires, such yellow\u0097lo, how good",
    "This spendthrift world, and what a lavish God!",
    "This fringe of wood,",
    "Blazing with buttercup and goldenrod.",
    "You too, beloved, are changed. Again I see",
    "Your face grow mystical, as on that night",
    "You turned to me,",
    "And all the trembling world\u0097and you\u0097were white.",
    "Aye, you are touched; your singing lips grow dumb;",
    "The fields absorb you, color you entire . . .",
    "And you become",
    "A goddess standing in a world of fire!"
