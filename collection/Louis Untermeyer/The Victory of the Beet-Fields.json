    "Green miles of leafy peace are spread",
    "Over these ranks, unseen and serried;",
    "Screening the trenches with their dead",
    "And living men already buried.",
    "The rains beat down, the torrents flow",
    "Into each cold and huddling cave;",
    "And over them the beet-fields grow,",
    "A fortress gentle as a grave.",
    "With rasping nerves and twitching muscles,",
    "We cannot even sleep; we start",
    "With every twig that snaps or rustles.",
    "Sought always by an unseen foe",
    "Over our heads the bullets fly;",
    "But more than these, we fear the snow,",
    "The silent shrapnel of the sky.",
    "\u201cYonder our colonel stalks and grieves,",
    "Meeting the storm with thoughts more stormy;",
    "But we, we sit and watch the leaves",
    "Fall down, a torn and crumpled army.",
    "We mourn for every leaf that lies,",
    "As though it were a comrade slain;",
    "Each was a shelter from the eyes",
    "Of every prying aeroplane. . . \u201d",
    "And in its cloudy uniform,",
    "Stilling the cannon\u2019s earthly thunder,",
    "The huge artillery of the storm",
    "Plows through the land and pulls it under.",
    "The rain beats down, until the slow",
    "And slipping earth resists no more. . .",
    "And over them the beets will grow",
    "Ranker and redder than before."
