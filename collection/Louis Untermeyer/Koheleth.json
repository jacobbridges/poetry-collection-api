    "I waited and worked",
    "To win myself leisure,",
    "Till loneliness irked",
    "And I turned to raw pleasure.",
    "I drank and I gamed,",
    "I feasted and wasted,",
    "Till, sick and ashamed,",
    "The food stood untasted.",
    "I searched in the Book",
    "For rooted convictions,",
    "Till the badgered brain shook",
    "With its own contradictions.",
    "Then, done with the speech,",
    "Of the foolishly lettered,",
    "I started to teach",
    "Life cannot be bettered:",
    "That the warrior fails",
    "Whatever his weapon,",
    "And nothing avails",
    "While time and chance happen.",
    "That fools who assure men",
    "With lies are respected,",
    "While the vision of pure men",
    "Is scorned and rejected.",
    "That a wise man goes grieving",
    "Even in Zion,",
    "While any dog living",
    "Outroars a dead lion."
