    "Shut out the light or let it filter through",
    "These frowning aisles as penitentially",
    "As though it walked in sackcloth. Let it be",
    "Laid at the feet of all that ever grew",
    "Twisted and false, like this rococo shrine",
    "Where cupids smirk from candy clouds and where",
    "The Lord, with polished nails and perfumed hair,",
    "Performs a parody of the divine.",
    "The candles hiss; the organ-pedals storm;",
    "Writhing and dark, the columns leave the earth",
    "To find a lonelier and darker height.",
    "The church grows dingy while the human swarm",
    "Struggles against the impenitent body\u2019s mirth.",
    "Ashes to ashes. . . . Go. . . . Shut out the light.",
    "And so the light runs laughing from the town,",
    "Pulling the sun with him along the roads",
    "That shed their muddy rivers as he goads",
    "Each blade of grass the ice had flattened down.",
    "At every empty bush he stops to fling",
    "Handfuls of birds with green and yellow throats;",
    "While even the hens, uncertain of their notes,",
    "Stir rusty vowels in attempts to sing.",
    "He daubs the chestnut-tips with sudden reds",
    "And throws an olive blush on naked hills",
    "That hoped, somehow, to keep themselves in white.",
    "Who calls for sackcloth now? He leaps and spreads",
    "A carnival of color, gladly spills",
    "His blood: the resurrection\u2014and the light."
