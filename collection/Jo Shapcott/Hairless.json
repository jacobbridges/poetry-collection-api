    "Can the bald lie? The nature of the skin says not:",
    "it's newborn-pale, erection-tender stuff,",
    "every thought visible,\u2014pure knowledge,",
    "mind in action\u2014shining through the skull.",
    "I saw one, a woman, hairless absolute, cleaning.",
    "She mopped the green floor, dusted bookshelves,",
    "all cloth and concentration, Queen of the moon.",
    "You can tell, with the bald, that the air",
    "speaks to them differently, touches their heads",
    "with exquisite expression. As she danced",
    "her laundry dance with the motes, everything",
    "she ever knew skittered under her scalp.",
    "It was clear just from the texture of her head,",
    "she was about to raise her arms to the sky;",
    "I covered my ears as she prepared to sing, roar,",
    "to let the big win resonate in the little room."
