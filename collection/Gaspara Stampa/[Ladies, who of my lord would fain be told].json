    "Ladies, who of my lord would fain be told,",
    "Picture a gentle knight, full sweet to see,",
    "Though young in years, in wisdom passing old,",
    "Model of glory and of valiancy;",
    "Fair-haired, bright colour glowing in his face,",
    "Tall and well-set, broad-shouldered, finally,",
    "In all his parts a paragon of grace",
    "Except in loving wantonly, ah me!",
    "Who'd know myself, picture a woman wrought",
    "In passion and in presence after pain's",
    "And death's own bitter images, a port",
    "Of safety where untroubled rest remains;",
    "One who with neither tears, nor sighs, nor zest",
    "Wakes pity in her cruel lover's breast."
