    "Deeply repentant of my sinful ways",
    "And of my trivial, manifold desires,",
    "Of squandering, alas, these few brief days",
    "Of fugitive life in tending love's vain fires,",
    "To Thee, Lord, Who dost move hard hearts again,",
    "And render warmth unto the frozen snow,",
    "And lighten every bitter load of pain",
    "For those who with Thy sacred ardours glow,",
    "To Thee I turn, O stretch forth Thy right hand",
    "And from this whirlpool rescue me, for I",
    "Without Thine aid could never reach the land;",
    "O willingly for us didst suffer loss,",
    "And to redeem mankind hung on the Cross,",
    "O gentle Saviour, leave me not to die."
