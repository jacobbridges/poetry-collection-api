    "It is not that I love you less",
    "Than when before your feet I lay,",
    "But to prevent the sad increase",
    "Of hopeless love, I keep away.",
    "In vain (alas!) for everything",
    "Which I have known belong to you,",
    "Your form does to my fancy bring,",
    "And makes my old wounds bleed anew.",
    "Who in the spring from the new sun",
    "Already has a fever got,",
    "Too late begins those shafts to shun,",
    "Which Ph\u0153bus through his veins has shot.",
    "Too late he would the pain assuage,",
    "And to thick shadows does retire;",
    "About with him he bears the rage,",
    "And in his tainted blood the fire.",
    "But vow\u2019d I have, and never must",
    "Your banish\u2019d servant trouble you;",
    "For if I break, you may distrust",
    "The vow I made to love you, too."
