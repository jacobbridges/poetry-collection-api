    "The mallet strikes but something's off,",
    "and so he hits again, curling that lower lip,",
    "purses his brow, as if this sign, this minor woe,",
    "were speech the vibes might understand,",
    "so when he lifts bluish lids as if wakened",
    "to the desired tone that rings now, it seems,",
    "it sounds, under wraps, a water-ly quaver,",
    "through the club crowd's silence,",
    "as it floats above us like an aerosol",
    "trying to find a new way to escape,",
    "passes through the wall's mortared pores",
    "to reverb in the cool night air of an",
    "unpeopled sidewalk, droning toward tracks",
    "where a passing peopled train sucks up",
    "and winds his finally found, wowed tone",
    "around its wheels, held there by steel heat",
    "one hundred miles, until it reaches the sea,",
    "where wheels and whistle overreach",
    "surging surf the good vibration feels such",
    "desire for, and leaves its tedium",
    "of the round and round, lofting to a sea",
    "that comes and goes but finally simply goes,",
    "as one night, this night, the cool vibes' air",
    "(struck finally in the changed groove of sax",
    "and ecstatic kit) is free, finally free,",
    "to go where we won't hear from it again."
