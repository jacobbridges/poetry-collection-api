    "The poetry\u2019s arrested in his scene,",
    "which can\u2019t be trusted, because I saw it",
    "through painkillers that softened my head,",
    "after I\u2019d asked him what Keats really meant:",
    "\u201cWas it a vision or a waking dream?\u201d",
    "\u2014",
    "In my waking vision dream, there\u2019s no glory,",
    "no prize committee or dew-drip Paradise.",
    "He\u2019s in an attic nook, or dim garage,",
    "or the cellar where he actually writes,",
    "the space a sheeted granulated matter,",
    "his silenced countenance and de-boned body",
    "scabby with caked ash about to crust and crack,",
    "poems piled at his feet like shoeshine rags.",
    "A grave purpled fraughtness colors him.",
    "What damaged him to this silence?",
    "He still writes and still isn\u2019t heard, as if",
    "not being heard is the whole point of it,",
    "and who are these children, these waving",
    "Halloween windsocks who won\u2019t talk to him?",
    "Beyond my busybody vision, he staggers",
    "through divorce, stooped, bereft, still writing.",
    "Spiky and singing, he out-writes them all,",
    "the cheered, spotless others\u2014he howls",
    "at their after-dinner-speaker poetry,",
    "the monsignors, the suburbans, the woo-woo",
    "wisdom merchants weeping to the bank.",
    "Poetry\u2019s a weather that doesn\u2019t need",
    "a specific place: it\u2019s a storm outside a cellar,",
    "sunshine at a bedroom window.",
    "Too much schoolroom poisons the idiom.",
    "Too much reverence stinks up the joint.",
    "The sorrow hanging in the dreamy air",
    "seems to confuse him, he can\u2019t understand",
    "how his heart came to hurt him like this,",
    "confuses it with leaves blurted out by storms,",
    "leaves that keep falling fast in the cellar,",
    "in poems he writes, the base desires and rage,",
    "he says the gods designed the set,",
    "stage-manage things, scripted them,",
    "the hilarity that hurts us is",
    "that none of it really matters,",
    "that poetry\u2019s griefs are intimates",
    "we don\u2019t choose.",
    "They come to us, for us.",
    "They cling to body and soul."
