    "Eighteen-sixty eighteen sixty-four,",
    "six hundred ten thousand men",
    "gaseous gray, blackened body parts",
    "like chopped wood in Virginia sunshine.",
    "Or nineteen-fourteen nineteen-eighteen,",
    "trench rats, thousands, big as badgers,",
    "rip chines from horse and human flesh.",
    "IED's, cluster bombs, punji sticks,",
    "primed to shred feet, thighs, spine, sack,",
    "yesterday, when we were countless.",
    "Conscience says Count them up and be good,",
    "suck on me like red candy stick",
    "in casual lookaway moments.",
    "Protected by neighbors, two girls",
    "villagers know to be deficient",
    "doll themselves up as bombs",
    "for market day's chickens and yams,",
    "and like a world-body neural surge,",
    "their protectors fly into fatty parts."
