    "A vision as of crowded city streets,",
    "With human life in endless overflow;",
    "Thunder of thoroughfares; trumpets that blow",
    "To battle; clamor, in obscure retreats,",
    "Of sailors landed from their anchored fleets;",
    "Tolling of bells in turrets, and below",
    "Voices of children, and bright flowers that throw",
    "O'er garden-walls their intermingled sweets!",
    "This vision comes to me when I unfold",
    "The volume of the Poet paramount,",
    "Whom all the Muses loved, not one alone; \u2014",
    "Into his hands they put the lyre of gold,",
    "And, crowned with sacred laurel at their fount,",
    "Placed him as Musagetes on their throne."
