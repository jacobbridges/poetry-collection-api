    "In the long, sleepless watches of the night,",
    "A gentle face \u2014 the face of one long dead \u2014",
    "Looks at me from the wall, where round its head",
    "The night-lamp casts a halo of pale light.",
    "Here in this room she died; and soul more white",
    "Never through martyrdom of fire was led",
    "To its repose; nor can in books be read",
    "The legend of a life more benedight.",
    "There is a mountain in the distant West",
    "That, sun-defying, in its deep ravines",
    "Displays a cross of snow upon its side.",
    "Such is the cross I wear upon my breast",
    "These eighteen years, through all the changing scenes",
    "And seasons, changeless since the day she died."
