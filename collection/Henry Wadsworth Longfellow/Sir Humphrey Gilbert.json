    "Southward with fleet of ice",
    "Sailed the corsair Death;",
    "Wild and gast blew the blast,",
    "And the east-wind was his breath.",
    "His lordly ships of ice",
    "Glisten in the sun;",
    "On each side, like pennons wide,",
    "Flashing crystal streamlets run.",
    "His sails of white sea-mist",
    "Dripped with silver rain;",
    "But where he passed there were cast",
    "Leaden shadows o'er the main.",
    "Eastward from Campobello",
    "Sir Humphrey Gilbert sailed;",
    "Three days or more seaward he bore,",
    "Then, alas! the land-wind failed.",
    "Alas! the land-wind failed,",
    "And ice-cold grew the night;",
    "And nevermore, on sea or shore,",
    "Should Sir Humphrey see the light.",
    "He sat upon the deck,",
    "The Book was in his hand;",
    "\"Do not fear! Heaven is as near,\"",
    "He said, \"by water as by land!\"",
    "In the first watch of the night,",
    "Without a signal's sound,",
    "Out of the sea, mysteriously,",
    "The fleet of Death rose all around.",
    "The moon and the evening star",
    "Were hanging in the shrouds;",
    "Every mast, as it passed,",
    "Seemed to rake the passing clouds.",
    "They grappled with their prize,",
    "At midnight black and cold!",
    "As of a rock was the shock;",
    "Heavily the ground-swell rolled.",
    "Southward through day and dark,",
    "They drift in cold embrace,",
    "With mist and rain, o'er the open main;",
    "Yet there seems no change of place.",
    "Southward, forever southward,",
    "They drift through dark and day;",
    "And like a dream, in the Gulf-Stream",
    "Sinking, vanish all away."
