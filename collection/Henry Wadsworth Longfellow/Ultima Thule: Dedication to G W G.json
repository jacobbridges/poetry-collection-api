    "With favoring winds, o'er sunlit seas,",
    "We sailed for the Hesperides,",
    "The land where golden apples grow;",
    "But that, ah! that was long ago.",
    "How far, since then, the ocean streams",
    "Have swept us from that land of dreams,",
    "That land of fiction and of truth,",
    "The lost Atlantis of our youth!",
    "Whither, ah, whither? Are not these",
    "The tempest-haunted Orcades,",
    "Where sea-gulls scream, and breakers roar,",
    "And wreck and sea-weed line the shore?",
    "Ultima Thule! Utmost Isle!",
    "Here in thy harbors for a while",
    "We lower our sails; a while we rest",
    "From the unending, endless quest."
