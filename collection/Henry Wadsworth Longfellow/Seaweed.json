    "When descends on the Atlantic",
    "The gigantic",
    "Storm-wind of the equinox,",
    "Landward in his wrath he scourges",
    "The toiling surges,",
    "Laden with seaweed from the rocks:",
    "From Bermuda's reefs; from edges",
    "Of sunken ledges,",
    "In some far-off, bright Azore;",
    "From Bahama, and the dashing,",
    "Silver-flashing",
    "Surges of San Salvador;",
    "From the tumbling surf, that buries",
    "The Orkneyan skerries,",
    "Answering the hoarse Hebrides;",
    "And from wrecks of ships, and drifting",
    "Spars, uplifting",
    "On the desolate, rainy seas; \u2014",
    "Ever drifting, drifting, drifting",
    "On the shifting",
    "Currents of the restless main;",
    "Till in sheltered coves, and reaches",
    "Of sandy beaches,",
    "All have found repose again.",
    "So when storms of wild emotion",
    "Strike the ocean",
    "Of the poet's soul, erelong",
    "From each cave and rocky fastness,",
    "In its vastness,",
    "Floats some fragment of a song:",
    "From the far-off isles enchanted,",
    "Heaven has planted",
    "With the golden fruit of Truth;",
    "From the flashing surf, whose vision",
    "Gleams Elysian",
    "In the tropic clime of Youth;",
    "From the strong Will, and the Endeavor",
    "That forever",
    "Wrestle with the tides of Fate;",
    "From the wreck of Hopes far-scattered,",
    "Tempest-shattered,",
    "Floating waste and desolate; \u2014",
    "Ever drifting, drifting, drifting",
    "On the shifting",
    "Currents of the restless heart;",
    "Till at length in books recorded,",
    "They, like hoarded",
    "Household words, no more depart."
