    "To invent the alef-beit,",
    "decipher the grammar of crows,",
    "read a tangle of bare branches",
    "with vowels of the last leaves",
    "scrawling their jittery speech",
    "on the sky\u2019s pale page.",
    "Choose a beginning.",
    "See what God yields and dirt cedes",
    "when tines disturb fescue, vetch, and sage,",
    "when your hand dips grain from a sack,",
    "scattering it among engraved furrows.",
    "Beyond the hill, a plume of dust",
    "where oxen track the hours.",
    "Does God lead or follow or scout?",
    "To answer, count to one again and again:",
    "a red maple leaf and a yellow maple leaf",
    "that wind rifles and rain shines until they let go,",
    "blazing their scripted nothingness on air."
