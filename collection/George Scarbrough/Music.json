    "Of the blue pine tree.",
    "Or he constructs a new trellis",
    "For the rambling rose over his front",
    "Gate or works at the great loom in his porch,",
    "Weaving his own coverlets.",
    "Sometimes, he paints drinking gourds",
    "To hang at his cold spring.",
    "His poems, delicate but strong,",
    "Paper the ceiling above his bed,",
    "So he can lie and read",
    "His own masterpieces.",
    "No man, he avers, can catch",
    "Such fish in one basket."
