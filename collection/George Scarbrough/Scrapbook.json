    "Green and brown current of river:",
    "Reverberant iron bridge: crossing over,",
    "Woman and child fixed at the center,",
    "Holding hands and both weeping:",
    "Because her child is weeping: because",
    "His mother weeps: because the river, far",
    "Underfoot, glitters through cracks",
    "In the wooden flooring that widen",
    "Perceptively as he steps.",
    "Ahead, heightened by a hill, dwarfed",
    "In yellow trees, the house is made ready.",
    "All should have been primer-perfect,",
    "Including the train rushing headlong",
    "Past the station, always in arrears,",
    "Never deigning to stop and put down",
    "A stepping-stool. Nothing more is given:",
    "Except perhaps an assignment of cause:",
    "A plank has fallen away to the river.",
    "The two figures clasp hands across the gulf,",
    "Rocking back and forth in soundless",
    "Oscillation there on the bridge",
    "Where my mind proposes to leave them",
    "In place, my mother and me,",
    "On the first day of school, 1921."
