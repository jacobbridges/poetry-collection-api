    "I caught a bird which made a ball",
    "And they thought better of it.",
    "But it is all of which they taught",
    "That they were in a hurry yet",
    "In a kind of a way they meant it best",
    "That they should change in and on account",
    "But they must not stare when they manage",
    "Whatever they are occasionally liable to do",
    "It is often easy to pursue them once in a while",
    "And in a way there is no repose",
    "They like it as well as they ever did",
    "But it is very often just by the time",
    "That they are able to separate",
    "In which case in effect they could",
    "Not only be very often present perfectly",
    "In each way whichever they chose.",
    "All of this never matters in authority",
    "But this which they need as they are alike",
    "Or in an especial case they will fulfill",
    "Not only what they have at their instigation",
    "Made for it as a decision in its entirety",
    "Made that they minded as well as blinded",
    "Lengthened for them welcome in repose",
    "But which they open as a chance",
    "But made it be perfectly their allowance",
    "All which they antagonise as once for all",
    "Kindly have it joined as they mind"
