    "Should they may be they might if they delight",
    "In why they must see it be there not only necessarily",
    "But which they might in which they might",
    "For which they might delight if they look there",
    "And they see there that they look there",
    "To see it be there which it is if it is",
    "Which may be where where it is",
    "If they do not occasion it to be different",
    "From what it is.",
    "In one direction there is the sun and the moon",
    "In the other direction there are cumulus clouds and the sky",
    "In the other direction there is why",
    "They look at what they see",
    "They look very long while they talk along",
    "And they may be said to see that at which they look",
    "Whenever there is no chance of its not being warmer",
    "Than if they wish which they were.",
    "They see that they have what is there may there",
    "Be there also what is to be there if they may care",
    "They care for it of course they care for it.",
    "Now only think three times roses green and blue",
    "And vegetables and pumpkins and pansies too",
    "Which they like as they are very likely not to be",
    "Reminded that it is more than ever necessary",
    "That they should never be surprised at any one time",
    "At just what they have been given by taking what they have",
    "Which they are very careful not to add with",
    "As they may easily indulge in the fragrance",
    "Not only of which but by which they know",
    "That they tell them so."
