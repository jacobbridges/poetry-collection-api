    "All their songs are of one hour",
    "Before dawn, when the birds begin.",
    "I sing another.",
    "In helpless midday, at the hour",
    "Even sparrows have no heart to shrill",
    "Comes news . . . Suddenly, the unimaginable",
    "Needs imagination and finds none.",
    "Violet ocean only nothing.",
    "Smoke of thyme and of cedar,",
    "Ornate birds, nothing.",
    "Even a god who came here,",
    "Hearing a sweet voice,",
    "Would find only old fires now,",
    "Brittle in the blackened trees.",
    "She was mast and sail. She was",
    "A stillness pregnant with motion,",
    "Adorable to me as, all my life,",
    "I have hidden a cruel, secret ocean",
    "In sinews and in sleep and cowardice.",
    "She forgave me. Once, she wept for me.",
    "Our child died then, and she is with him."
