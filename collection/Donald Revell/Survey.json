    "I am so lonely for the twentieth century,",
    "for the deeply felt, obscene graffiti",
    "of armed men and the beautiful bridges",
    "that make them so small and carry them",
    "into the hearts of cities written like words",
    "across nothing, the dense void",
    "history became in my beautiful century.",
    "When a man talks reason, he postpones something.",
    "He gets in the way of a machine that knows him",
    "for the sad vengeance he is, somewhere close",
    "to the bald name of his city. \"New York\"",
    "means \"strike back.\" \"Attica\" means \"strike back\"",
    "and so does anyplace in the world",
    "in the huge eyes and tender hands of my century.",
    "I went to the capital. I had a banner,",
    "and there were thousands of people like me.",
    "There was an airplane, and for a moment",
    "heavy with laurel and sprays of peach blossom",
    "something that has never happened before",
    "stretched like a woman's shadow on a hedge",
    "between the plane and the people who saw it flying.",
    "It was the real name of the century.",
    "It told everyone to strike back",
    "until there was no reason in the world",
    "except a machine stalled overhead",
    "that knows everyone and is as delicate",
    "as peach blossom. But the poor years come too late."
