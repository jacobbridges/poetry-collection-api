    "only the manners of centuries ago can teach me",
    "how to address you my lover as who you are",
    "O Sestius, how could you put up with my children",
    "thinking all the while you were bearing me as in your mirror",
    "it doesn't matter anymore if spring wreaks its fiery",
    "or lamblike dawn on my new-found asceticism, some joke",
    "I wouldn't sleep with you or any man if you paid me",
    "and most of you poets don't have the cash anyway",
    "so please rejoin your fraternal books forever",
    "while you miss in your securest sleep Ms. Rosy-fingered dawn",
    "who might've been induced to digitalize a part of you",
    "were it not for your self-induced revenge of undoneness",
    "it's good to live without a refrigerator! why bother",
    "to chill the handiwork of Ceres and of Demeter?",
    "and of the lonesome Sappho. let's have it warm for now."
