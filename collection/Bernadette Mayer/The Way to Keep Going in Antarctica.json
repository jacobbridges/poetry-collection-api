    "Be strong Bernadette",
    "Nobody will ever know",
    "I came here for a reason",
    "Perhaps there is a life here",
    "Of not being afraid of your own heart beating",
    "Do not be afraid of your own heart beating",
    "Look at very small things with your eyes",
    "& stay warm",
    "Nothing outside can cure you but everything's outside",
    "There is great shame for the world in knowing",
    "You may have gone this far",
    "Perhaps this is why you love the presence of other people so much",
    "Perhaps this is why you wait so impatiently",
    "You have nothing more to teach",
    "Until there is no more panic at the knowledge of your own real existence",
    "& then only special childish laughter to be shown",
    "& no more lies no more",
    "Not to find you no",
    "More coming back & more returning",
    "Southern journey",
    "Small things & not my own debris",
    "Something to fight against",
    "& we are all very fluent about ourselves",
    "Our own ideas of food, a Wild sauce",
    "There's not much point in its being over: but we do not speak them:",
    "I had written: \"the man who sewed his soles back on his feet\"",
    "And then I panicked most at the sound of what the wind could do",
    "to me",
    "if I crawled back to the house, two feet give no position, if",
    "the branches cracked over my head & their threatening me, if I",
    "covered my face with beer & sweated till you returned",
    "If I suffered what else could I do"
