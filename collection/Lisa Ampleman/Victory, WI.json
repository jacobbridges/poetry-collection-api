    "All hail the crumbling stone monument",
    "to the Battle of Bad Axe, the wooden helve",
    "long rotted and burned, the short walk to the river,",
    "where we can bathe in its brown,",
    "where a steamboat ghost huffs out",
    "a stream of bullets. We are invulnerable",
    "to their spectral lead, descendants",
    "of fur traders (beaver, ermine,",
    "skunk). Our lungs are clean and pink. Let\u2019s visit",
    "the saw shop, the greenhouse with bluff views,",
    "the pines and stacks of firewood,",
    "the Blackhawk general store, named for",
    "the warrior who waved a chalky,",
    "misunderstood flag and eluded capture",
    "for weeks. In winter, eagles",
    "dive here, gathering lift when the wind",
    "hits the bluffs: all hail the migrating",
    "raptor, its piercing talon and yellow cere."
