    "On the rough diamond,",
    "the hand-cut field below the dog lot and barn,",
    "we rehearsed the strict technique",
    "of bunting. I watched from the infield,",
    "the mound, the backstop",
    "as your left hand climbed the bat, your legs",
    "and shoulders squared toward the pitcher.",
    "You could drop it like a seed",
    "down either base line. I admired your style,",
    "but not enough to take my eyes off the bank",
    "that served as our center-field fence.",
    "Years passed, three leagues of organized ball,",
    "no few lives. I could homer",
    "into the left-field lot of Carmichael Motors,",
    "and still you stressed the same technique,",
    "the crouch and spring, the lead arm absorbing",
    "just enough impact. That whole tiresome pitch",
    "about basics never changing,",
    "and I never learned what you were laying down.",
    "Like a hand brushed across the bill of a cap,",
    "let this be the sign",
    "I\u2019m getting a grip on the sacrifice."
