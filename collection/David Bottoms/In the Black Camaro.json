    "Through the orange glow of taillights,",
    "I crossed the dirt road, entered",
    "the half-mile of darkness and owl screech,",
    "tangled briar and fallen trunk, followed",
    "the yellow beam of Billy Parker's flashlight",
    "down the slick needle-hill,",
    "half crawling, half sliding and kicking",
    "for footholds, tearing up whole handfuls",
    "of scrub brush and leaf mold",
    "until I jumped the mud bank, walked",
    "the ankle-deep creek,",
    "the last patch of pine, the gully,",
    "and knelt at the highway stretching",
    "in front of Billy Parker's house,",
    "spotted the black Chevy Camaro parked",
    "under a maple not fifty feet",
    "from the window where Billy Parker rocked",
    "in and out of view,",
    "studying in the bad light of a table lamp",
    "the fine print of his Allstate policy.",
    "I cut the flashlight, checked up",
    "and down the highway. Behind me",
    "the screech growing distant, fading",
    "into woods, but coming on",
    "a network of tree frogs signaling",
    "along the creek. Only that, and the quiet",
    "of my heels coming down on asphalt",
    "as I crossed the two-lane and stood",
    "at the weedy edge of Billy Parker's yard,",
    "stood in the lamp glare of the living room",
    "where plans were being made to make me rich",
    "and thought of a boat and Johnson outboard,",
    "of all the lures on a K-Mart wall,",
    "of reels and graphite rods, coolers",
    "of beer, weedy banks of dark fishy rivers,",
    "and of Billy Parker rocking in his chair,",
    "studying his coverage, his bank account,",
    "his layoff at Lockheed, his wife laboring",
    "in the maternity ward",
    "of the Cobb General Hospital. For all",
    "of this, I crouched in the shadow",
    "of fender and maple, popped the door",
    "on the Camaro, and found",
    "in the faint house-light drifting",
    "through the passenger's window",
    "the stripped wires hanging below the dash.",
    "I took the driver's seat, kicked",
    "the clutch, then eased again",
    "as I remembered the glove box",
    "and the pint of Seagram's Billy Parker",
    "had not broken the seal on. Like an alarm",
    "the tree frogs went off in the woods.",
    "I drank until they hushed",
    "and I could hear through cricket chatter",
    "the rockers on Billy Parker's chair",
    "grinding ridges into his living room floor,",
    "worry working on him like hard time.",
    "Then a wind working in river grass,",
    "a red current slicing",
    "around stumps and river snags, a boat-drift",
    "pulling against an anchor",
    "as I swayed in the seat of the black Camaro,",
    "grappled for the wires",
    "hanging in darkness between my knees,",
    "saw through the tinted windshield",
    "by a sudden white moon",
    "rolling out of the clouds, a riverbank",
    "two counties away, a place to jump and roll",
    "on the soft shoulder of the gravel road,",
    "a truck in a thicket a half-mile downstream."
