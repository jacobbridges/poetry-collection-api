    "When I sat for a moment in the bleachers",
    "of the lower-school gym",
    "to watch, one by one, the girls of my daughter\u2019s kindergarten",
    "climb the fat rope hung over the Styrofoam pit,",
    "I remembered my sweet exasperated mother",
    "and those shifting faces of injury",
    "that followed me like an odor to ball games and practices,",
    "playgrounds of monkey bars",
    "and trampolines, those wilted children sprouting daily",
    "in that garden of trauma behind her eyes.",
    "Then Rachel\u2019s turn,",
    "the smallest child in class, and up she went, legs twined",
    "on the rope, ponytail swinging, fifteen, twenty,",
    "twenty-five feet, the pink tendrils of her leotard",
    "climbing without effort",
    "until she\u2019d cleared the lower rafters.",
    "She looked down, then up, hanging in that balance",
    "of pride and fear,",
    "then glancing",
    "toward the bleachers to see if I watched, let go",
    "her left hand, unworried by that boy",
    "with the waffled skull, stiff and turning blue",
    "under the belly of a horse,",
    "or the Christmas Eve skater on Cagle\u2019s Lake,",
    "her face a black plum",
    "against the bottom of the ice."
