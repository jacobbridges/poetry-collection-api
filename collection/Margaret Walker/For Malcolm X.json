    "All you violated ones with gentle hearts;",

    "All you gambling sons and hooked children and bowery bums",
    "Hating white devils and black bourgeoisie,",
    "Thumbing your noses at your burning red suns,",
    "Gather round this coffin and mourn your dying swan.",
    "Snow-white moslem head-dress around a dead black face!",
    "Beautiful were your sand-papering words against our skins!",
    "Our blood and water pour from your flowing wounds.",
    "You have cut open our breasts and dug scalpels in our brains.",
    "When and Where will another come to take your holy place?",
    "Old man mumbling in his dotage, crying child, unborn?"
