    "Wheel me down to the shore",
    "where the lighthouse was abandoned",
    "and the moon tolls in the rafters.",
    "Let me hear the wind paging through the trees",
    "and see the stars flaring out, one by one,",
    "like the forgotten faces of the dead.",
    "I was never able to pray,",
    "but let me inscribe my name",
    "in the book of waves",
    "and then stare into the dome",
    "of a sky that never ends",
    "and see my voice sail into the night."
