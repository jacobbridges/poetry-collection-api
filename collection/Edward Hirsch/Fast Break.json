    "A hook shot kisses the rim and",
    "hangs there, helplessly, but doesn\u2019t drop,",
    "and for once our gangly starting center",
    "boxes out his man and times his jump",
    "perfectly, gathering the orange leather",
    "from the air like a cherished possession",
    "and spinning around to throw a strike",
    "to the outlet who is already shoveling",
    "an underhand pass toward the other guard",
    "scissoring past a flat-footed defender",
    "who looks stunned and nailed to the floor",
    "in the wrong direction, trying to catch sight",
    "of a high, gliding dribble and a man",
    "letting the play develop in front of him",
    "in slow motion, almost exactly",
    "like a coach\u2019s drawing on the blackboard,",
    "both forwards racing down the court",
    "the way that forwards should, fanning out",
    "and filling the lanes in tandem, moving",
    "together as brothers passing the ball",
    "between them without a dribble, without",
    "a single bounce hitting the hardwood",
    "until the guard finally lunges out",
    "and commits to the wrong man",
    "while the power-forward explodes past them",
    "in a fury, taking the ball into the air",
    "by himself now and laying it gently",
    "against the glass for a lay-up,",
    "but losing his balance in the process,",
    "inexplicably falling, hitting the floor",
    "with a wild, headlong motion",
    "for the game he loved like a country",
    "and swiveling back to see an orange blur",
    "floating perfectly through the net."
