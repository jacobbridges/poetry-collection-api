    "I lived between my heart and my head,",
    "like a married couple who can't get along.",
    "I lived between my left arm, which is swift",
    "and sinister, and my right, which is righteous.",
    "I lived between a laugh and a scowl,",
    "and voted against myself, a two-party system.",
    "My left leg dawdled or danced along,",
    "my right cleaved to the straight and narrow.",
    "My left shoulder was like a stripper on vacation,",
    "my right stood upright as a Roman soldier.",
    "Let's just say that my left side was the organ",
    "donor and leave my private parts alone,",
    "but as for my eyes, which are two shades",
    "of brown, well, Dionysus, meet Apollo.",
    "Look at Eve raising her left eyebrow",
    "while Adam puts his right foot down.",
    "No one expected it to survive,",
    "but divorce seemed out of the question.",
    "I suppose my left hand and my right hand",
    "will be clasped over my chest in the coffin",
    "and I'll be reconciled at last,",
    "I'll be whole again."
