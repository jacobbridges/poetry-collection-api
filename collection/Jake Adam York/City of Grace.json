    "City of Grace, you open,",
    "you part your curtains",
    "and smile like a hostess",
    "when we call your name,",
    "you tender what any traveler needs,",
    "a call to ease, a balm,",
    "a kindness, whatever storm.",
    "You take us in. City of Grace",
    "and Benevolence, you say",
    "you know what solace means,",
    "burned so often they called you",
    "Chimneyville, and now",
    "you can't forget,",
    "you've written it in bronze",
    "outside the City Hall",
    "the War made a hospital",
    "for the Yankee",
    "and for your Rebel sons,",
    "like the one who is always dying",
    "outside the Capitol.",
    "City of Fame,",
    "you hold him still, laurel",
    "on your crown, fan",
    "making a hand of wind",
    "to soothe his face",
    "and fill the eagle's wings",
    "spread above to promise,",
    "to say again",
    "just how far you'll go.",
    "City of Remembrance,",
    "you keep so well, you show us",
    "where Welty lived,",
    "the house still there, how she skated",
    "to the library, through",
    "the Capitol, the book",
    "now cast and open in her hands.",
    "Tell me now, City of Embrace,",
    "of the newsreels' children",
    "rounded from their march,",
    "flags gathered, the children",
    "trucked to the fairground cages,",
    "the ones who peer out",
    "through the chicken wire.",
    "City of Richard Wright",
    "and Ross Barnett, tell me",
    "not just where the Governor pled",
    "her customs, but where the writer",
    "went to school, a short walk",
    "from here, thinking",
    "until one wanted the world to be different",
    "that one would look at the world",
    "with will and emotion, and tell me,",
    "then, where Medgar Evers lived,",
    "whom you remember",
    "with a post office and a stamp",
    "and an airport, though",
    "when I've asked you've turned",
    "to someone else and said",
    "\u2022",
    "Ambivalent City, you know the way,",
    "but you let me find it, the statue,",
    "the library, miles away,",
    "the Boulevard, and then the house,",
    "the plaque that tells us",
    "this is where he lived, perfect",
    "as a photograph, as a movie,",
    "only the color's unreal,",
    "or too real, the green piercing,",
    "the hose uncoiled as if someone",
    "might return to water the lawn.",
    "Neighbors cruise, panning",
    "like cameras as I stand",
    "where he must have stood",
    "choosing the house with no front door,",
    "where Beckwith must have stood,",
    "who drove the town asking everyone",
    "where Evers lived, where",
    "he marked his man.",
    "There is nowhere else to stand.",
    "A city is a kind of memory,",
    "and if you stay too long",
    "the shape of someone else",
    "will hold you there",
    "until day repeats its failure",
    "and the streetlights wake",
    "and yawn all color from the dusk",
    "and the house becomes a photograph",
    "of itself and the small wings",
    "unfold from the fabric of night,",
    "from all the magnolias' ears",
    "and the broad stretch of the reservoir",
    "and the river you can smell",
    "as they gather into pearls",
    "the stars' historic light,",
    "the eyes' whose looking stays",
    "long after the pupils",
    "have burned away. Fireflies",
    "fall back into the grass,",
    "and the mayflies clasp each other",
    "in a kind of halo. City of Ghosts,",
    "you can't abandon your history,",
    "and it won't abandon you.",
    "You watch each other,",
    "you call each other's names.",
    "The sidewalks, the driveways",
    "gleam like quarried moon,",
    "and each open hand repeats",
    "the ambient light as the crickets",
    "fill with heat and raise again",
    "the street's last breath:"
