    "\u2014From the narrative of the captivity of Mrs. Mary Rowlandson, who was taken prisoner by the Wampanoag when Lancaster, Massachusetts, was destroyed, in the year 1676",
    "The stream was swift, and so cold",
    "I thought I would be sliced in two.",
    "But he dragged me from the flood",
    "by the ends of my hair.",
    "I had grown to recognize his face.",
    "I could distinguish it from the others.",
    "There were times I feared I understood",
    "his language, which was not human,",
    "and I knelt to pray for strength.",
    "We were pursued by God\u2019s agents",
    "or pitch devils, I did not know.",
    "Only that we must march.",
    "Their guns were loaded with swan shot.",
    "I could not suckle and my child\u2019s wail",
    "put them in danger.",
    "He had a woman",
    "with teeth black and glittering.",
    "She fed the child milk of acorns.",
    "The forest closed, the light deepened.",
    "I told myself that I would starve",
    "before I took food from his hands",
    "but I did not starve.",
    "One night",
    "he killed a deer with a young one in her",
    "and gave me to eat of the fawn.",
    "It was so tender,",
    "the bones like the stems of flowers,",
    "that I followed where he took me.",
    "The night was thick. He cut the cord",
    "that bound me to the tree.",
    "After that the birds mocked.",
    "Shadows gaped and roared",
    "and the trees flung down",
    "their sharpened lashes.",
    "He did not notice God\u2019s wrath.",
    "God blasted fire from half-buried stumps.",
    "I hid my face in my dress, fearing He would burn us all",
    "but this, too, passed.",
    "Rescued, I see no truth in things.",
    "My husband drives a thick wedge",
    "through the earth, still it shuts",
    "to him year after year.",
    "My child is fed of the first wheat.",
    "I lay myself to sleep",
    "on a Holland-laced pillowbeer.",
    "I lay to sleep.",
    "And in the dark I see myself",
    "as I was outside their circle.",
    "They knelt on deerskins, some with sticks,",
    "and he led his company in the noise",
    "until I could no longer bear",
    "the thought of how I was.",
    "I stripped a branch",
    "and struck the earth,",
    "in time, begging it to open",
    "to admit me",
    "as he was",
    "and feed me honey from the rock."
