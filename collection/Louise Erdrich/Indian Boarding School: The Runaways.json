    "Home\u2019s the place we head for in our sleep.",
    "Boxcars stumbling north in dreams",
    "don\u2019t wait for us. We catch them on the run.",
    "The rails, old lacerations that we love,",
    "shoot parallel across the face and break",
    "just under Turtle Mountains. Riding scars",
    "you can\u2019t get lost. Home is the place they cross.",
    "The lame guard strikes a match and makes the dark",
    "less tolerant. We watch through cracks in boards",
    "as the land starts rolling, rolling till it hurts",
    "to be here, cold in regulation clothes.",
    "We know the sheriff\u2019s waiting at midrun",
    "to take us back. His car is dumb and warm.",
    "The highway doesn\u2019t rock, it only hums",
    "like a wing of long insults. The worn-down welts",
    "of ancient punishments lead back and forth.",
    "All runaways wear dresses, long green ones,",
    "the color you would think shame was. We scrub",
    "the sidewalks down because it's shameful work.",
    "Our brushes cut the stone in watered arcs",
    "and in the soak frail outlines shiver clear",
    "a moment, things us kids pressed on the dark",
    "face before it hardened, pale, remembering",
    "delicate old injuries, the spines of names and leaves."
