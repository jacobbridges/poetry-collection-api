    "Two wind chimes,",
    "one brass and prone to anger,",
    "one with the throat of an angel,",
    "swing from my porch eave,",
    "sing with the storm.",
    "Last year I lived five months",
    "under that shrill choir,",
    "boxing your house, crowding books",
    "into crates, from some pages",
    "your own voice crying.",
    "Some days the chimes raged.",
    "Some days they hung still.",
    "They fretted when I dug up",
    "the lily I gave you in April,",
    "blooming, strangely, in fall.",
    "Together, they scolded me",
    "when I counted pennies you left",
    "in each can, cup, and drawer,",
    "when I rechecked the closets",
    "for remnants of you.",
    "The last day, the house empty,",
    "resonant with space, the two chimes",
    "had nothing to toll for.",
    "I walked out, took them down,",
    "carried our mute spirits home."
