    "At the gym, they told me I would not die,",
    "I would only get sexier, and I believed them.",
    "I spent my nights wondering if this was going to turn",
    "into something long-term, if this was what is meant by casual,",
    "or if this was just my annual catastrophic disappointment",
    "because if it wasn\u2019t, then I would have to brace",
    "myself. I took my medication and looked at pictures",
    "of people who were not in love with me. I deleted",
    "their names from my cache, said hello to my cat",
    "over the phone, took more medication. Days",
    "passed. I learned it\u2019s hard to measure your own increasing",
    "sexiness. I enlisted bystanders. I passed mirrors",
    "and pretended they were not mirrors, but clean",
    "windows, and I was not myself, I was",
    "a clean stranger. Some days I was sure",
    "she wanted to come home with me, and",
    "I had to let her down easy, through the window,",
    "like a priest. Once I\u2019d been unleashed",
    "from thoughts of my own death I was free",
    "to be loved in the way I always knew I\u2019d deserved:",
    "reciprocally, in Fiji, our bodies lithe and bronzed",
    "like gods, but at the same time I felt like a vampire,",
    "and none of my friends could relate. They were jealous",
    "of my book deal, my time spent at the ashram",
    "while they were here, suffering another winter,",
    "their unsexiness a flourescent sign that blinks all night."
