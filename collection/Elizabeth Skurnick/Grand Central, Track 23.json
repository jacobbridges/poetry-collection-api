    "I forgot to tell you it's almost time to go.",
    "The sun has distilled its particular worn essence",
    "And the glittering trout is flipped on the bow.",
    "A man asks me what time it is. I don't know.",
    "I have emptied my purse and wept in the presence",
    "Of onlookers. I forgot to remember to go",
    "Before eleven, when the steely arrow",
    "Shot swimming to its underneath, tense",
    "As a stream of salmon in reverse below",
    "The laureled, relentless clocks. The sceptered row",
    "Of columns dreams one o'clock, immense,",
    "Inviolate. What time is it? I don't know.",
    "This story concerns the night I tried to go\u2014",
    "Though many times I flopped into the silence",
    "Of orange plastic seating like onto the bow",
    "Of a lonely ship, and felt my breathing slow.",
    "The frail, retreating stand of columns prevents",
    "The clocks from telling me time and time again to go.",
    "At my feet, a glittering trout swims past the bow."
