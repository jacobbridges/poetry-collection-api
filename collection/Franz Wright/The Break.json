    "nothing it came,",
    "a cruel blessing,",
    "the ultimate low",
    "note of an organ",
    "made of ice or a passing",
    "night train",
    "of black holes. He",
    "kept lying there \u2014",
    "what else was he",
    "supposed to do? \u2014 with watch",
    "pressed to one ear, emitting",
    "a molecular hum. (Ever wonder",
    "how they fit a whole",

    "such was its speed",

    "the sunlight appears",
    "all at once like",

    "sow, maggot",
    "in color."
