    "Sorrow is my own yard",
    "where the new grass",
    "flames as it has flamed",
    "often before, but not",
    "with the cold fire",
    "that closes round me this year.",
    "Thirty-five years",
    "I lived with my husband.",
    "The plum tree is white today",
    "with masses of flowers.",
    "Masses of flowers",
    "load the cherry branches",
    "and color some bushes",
    "yellow and some red,",
    "but the grief in my heart",
    "is stronger than they,",
    "for though they were my joy",
    "formerly, today I notice them",
    "and turn away forgetting.",
    "Today my son told me",
    "that in the meadows,",
    "at the edge of the heavy woods",
    "in the distance, he saw",
    "trees of white flowers.",
    "I feel that I would like",
    "to go there",
    "and fall into those flowers",
    "and sink into the marsh near them."
