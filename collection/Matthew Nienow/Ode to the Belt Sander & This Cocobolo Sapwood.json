    "The belt kicks on with a whir",
    "the whir",
    "licks the end grain of the offcut with a hint",
    "of hesitation. A small wind of ochre dust",
    "sweeps off the belt before the belt comes back",
    "to where it was. The whole room swells",
    "with the scent of cinnamon",
    "desire.",
    "How imprecise the smell of desire.",
    "The wood takes on a sheen, a gloss",
    "the grain can live behind without worry",
    "of being forgotten. A single knot blinks",
    "out of the small block and becomes",
    "the eye of a hummingbird, its beak",
    "bending around the edge of the wood,",
    "its small song captured in the annular rings.",
    "To think, this block was tossed in",
    "with the scraps. That the bird",
    "could have been lost. Or burned."
