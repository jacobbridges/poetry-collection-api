    "The redbreast",
    "loves you and wants you",
    "to remember the love",
    "So it makes you puke into the toilet blind",

    "And drowned",

    "Who dissolves on my tongue",
    "Who flies from my finger",

    "behind your right and cleans",
    "its babies with",
    "its beak",
    "Scrubs its babies clean",

    "My brain is a cutter",
    "My initials are beats per second",
    "Scrubbed down to zero",
    "by the rubies",
    "in the halo",
    "I whispered your name into the red air",
    "and you answered"
