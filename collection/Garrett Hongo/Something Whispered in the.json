    "No one knew the secret of my flutes,",
    "and I laugh now",
    "because some said I was enlightened.",
    "But the truth is",
    "I\u2019m only a gardener",
    "who before the War",
    "was a dirt farmer and learned",
    "how to grow the bamboo",
    "in ditches next to the fields,",
    "how to leave things alone",
    "and let the silt build up",
    "until it was deep enough to stink",
    "bad as night soil, bad",
    "as the long, witch-grey",
    "hair of a ghost.",
    "No secret in that.",
    "My land was no good, rocky,",
    "and so dry I had to sneak",
    "water from the whites,",
    "hacksaw the locks off the chutes at night,",
    "and blame Mexicans, Filipinos,",
    "or else some wicked spirit",
    "of a migrant, murdered in his sleep",
    "by sheriffs and wanting revenge.",
    "Even though they never believed me,",
    "it didn\u2019t matter\u2014no witnesses,",
    "and my land was never thick with rice,",
    "only the bamboo",
    "growing lush as old melodies",
    "and whispering like brush strokes",
    "against the fine scroll of wind.",
    "I found some string in the shed",
    "or else took a few stalks",
    "and stripped off their skins,",
    "wove the fibers, the floss,",
    "into cords I could bind",
    "around the feet, ankles, and throats",
    "of only the best bamboos.",
    "I used an ice pick for an awl,",
    "a fish knife to carve finger holes,",
    "and a scythe to shape the mouthpiece.",
    "I had my flutes.",
    "*",
    "When the War came,",
    "I told myself I lost nothing.",
    "My land, which was barren,",
    "was not actually mine but leased",
    "(we could not own property)",
    "and the shacks didn\u2019t matter.",
    "What did were the power lines nearby",
    "and that sabotage was suspected.",
    "What mattered to me",
    "were the flutes I burned",
    "in a small fire",
    "by the bath house.",
    "*",
    "All through Relocation,",
    "in the desert where they put us,",
    "at night when the stars talked",
    "and the sky came down",
    "and drummed against the mesas,",
    "I could hear my flutes",
    "wail like fists of wind",
    "whistling through the barracks.",
    "I came out of Camp,",
    "a blanket slung over my shoulder,",
    "found land next to this swamp,",
    "planted strawberries and beanplants,",
    "planted the dwarf pines and tended them,",
    "got rich enough to quit",
    "and leave things alone,",
    "let the ditches clog with silt again",
    "and the bamboo grow thick as history.",
    "*",
    "So, when it\u2019s bad now,",
    "when I can\u2019t remember what\u2019s lost",
    "and all I have for the world to take",
    "means nothing,",
    "I go out back of the greenhouse",
    "at the far end of my land",
    "where the grasses go wild",
    "and the arroyos come up",
    "with cat\u2019s-claw and giant dahlias,",
    "where the children of my neighbors",
    "consult with the wise heads",
    "of sunflowers, huge against the sky,",
    "where the rivers of weather",
    "and the charred ghosts of old melodies",
    "converge to flood my land",
    "and sustain the one thicket",
    "of memory that calls for me",
    "to come and sit",
    "among the tall canes",
    "and shape full-throated songs",
    "out of wind, out of bamboo,",
    "out of a voice",
    "that only whispers."
