    "At six I lived for spells:",
    "how a few Hawaiian words could call",
    "up the rain, could hymn like the sea",
    "in the long swirl of chambers",
    "curling in the nautilus of a shell,",
    "how Amida\u2019s ballads of the Buddhaland",
    "in the drone of the priest\u2019s liturgy",
    "could conjure money from the poor",
    "and give them nothing but mantras,",
    "the strange syllables that healed desire.",
    "I lived for stories about the war",
    "my grandfather told over",
    "cards,",
    "slapping them down on the mats",
    "with a sharp Japanese",
    ".",
    "I lived for songs my grandmother sang",
    "stirring curry into a thick stew,",
    "weaving a calligraphy of Kannon\u2019s love",
    "into grass mats and straw sandals.",
    "I lived for the red volcano dirt",
    "staining my toes, the salt residue",
    "of surf and sea wind in my hair,",
    "the arc of a flat stone skipping",
    "in the hollow trough of a wave.",
    "I lived in a child\u2019s world, waited",
    "for my father to drag himself home,",
    "dusted with blasts of sand, powdered",
    "and the strange ash of raw cement,",
    "his deafness made worse by the clang",
    "of pneumatic drills, sore in his bones",
    "from the buckings of a jackhammer.",
    "He\u2019d hand me a scarred lunchpail,",
    "let me unlace the hightop G.I. boots,",
    "call him the new name I\u2019d invented",
    "that day in school, write it for him",
    "on his newspaper. He\u2019d rub my face",
    "with hands that felt like gravel roads,",
    "tell me to move, go play, an then he\u2019d",
    "walk to the laundry sink to scrub,",
    "rinse the dirt of his long day",
    "from a face brown and grained as koa wood.",
    "I wanted to take away the pain",
    "in his legs, the swelling in his joints,",
    "give him back his hearing,",
    "clear and rare as crystal chimes,",
    "the fins of glass that wrinkled",
    "and sparked the air with their sound.",
    "I wanted to heal the sores that work",
    "and war had sent to him,",
    "let him play catch in the backyard",
    "with me, tossing a tennis ball",
    "past papaya trees without the shoulders",
    "of pain shrugging back his arms.",
    "I wanted to become a doctor of pure magic,",
    "to string a necklace of sweet words",
    "fragrant as pine needles and plumeria,",
    "fragrant as the bread my mother baked,",
    "place it like a lei of cowrie shells",
    "and",
    "flowers around my father\u2019s neck,",
    "and chant him a blessing, a sutra."
