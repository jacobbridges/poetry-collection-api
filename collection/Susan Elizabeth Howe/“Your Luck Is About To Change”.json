    "Ominous inscrutable Chinese news",
    "to get just before Christmas,",
    "considering my reasonable health,",
    "marriage spicy as moo-goo-gai-pan,",
    "career running like a not-too-old Chevrolet.",
    "Not bad, considering what can go wrong:",
    "the bony finger of Uncle Sam",
    "might point out my husband,",
    "my own national guard,",
    "and set him in Afghanistan;",
    "my boss could take a personal interest;",
    "the pain in my left knee could spread to my right.",
    "Still, as the old year tips into the new,",
    "I insist on the infant hope, gooing and kicking",
    "his legs in the air. I won't give in",
    "to the dark, the sub-zero weather, the fog,",
    "or even the neighbors' Nativity.",
    "Their four-year-old has arranged",
    "his whole legion of dinosaurs",
    "so they, too, worship the child,",
    "joining the cow and sheep. Or else,",
    "ultimate mortals, they've come to eat",
    "ox and camel, Mary and Joseph,",
    "then savor the newborn babe."
