    "I have known great gold Sorrows:",
    "Majestic Griefs shall serve me watchfully",
    "Through the slow-pacing morrows:",
    "I have knelt hopeless where sea-echoing",
    "Dim endless voices cried of suffering",
    "Vibrant and far in broken litany:",
    "Where white magnolia and tuberose hauntingly",
    "Pulsed their regretful sweets along the air-\u2014",
    "All things most tragical, most fair,",
    "Have still encompassed me . . .",
    "I dance where in the screaming market-place",
    "The dusty world that watches buys and sells,",
    "With painted merriment upon my face,",
    "Whirling my bells,",
    "Thrusting my sad soul to its mockery.",
    "I have known great gold Sorrows . . .",
    "Shall they not mock me, these pain-haunted ones,",
    "If it shall make them merry, and forget",
    "That grief shall rise and set",
    "With the unchanging, unforgetting suns",
    "Of their relentless morrows?"
