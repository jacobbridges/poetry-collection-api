    "We were thinking of starting a band,",
    "all lined up like ducks in a shooting gallery.",
    "This one would be gem, that one",
    "metamorphic, the rest pebbles and some",
    "laboratory-grown, semi-precious stones. The trees",
    "were in it for the long-run; they swayed or stood",
    "stoic, sheltered what they could. We made the cast",
    "as an idle grouping: we played the trump, the idiot,",
    "the glue. We backdropped with hearts hardly",
    "beating, our eyes set straight in our heads: the bombed-",
    "out school kids, the oilfields scrubbed in turns. We chewed",
    "the fat amongst ourselves. You said, this place",
    "should be more festive: a lightning bolt, a snail, a fraud. I set",
    "a crumb aside for the local roof rat; you tallied the droppings,",
    "the amputees, the gold. I blew my top when you lost",
    "\"Dominion.\" You said, what can be done? It's gone,",
    "it's gone. Wind started in through the rift-way, buzzed",
    "over our slate-blue bones. All the leaves have aged",
    "with kindness, all our pretend",
    "looped and windowed raggedness went largely",
    "unseen. We were on stage the whole performance, held",
    "our breath for the final moments with cheeks rent",
    "and red. No neck was slit on our backs; no distraught",
    "lover jumped from our cliff's edge. There was a stirring backstage",
    "we could sense it: a temptress, some anger, some",
    "sin. Weeds came thick around us. The act",
    "had been bungled sorely. We withheld our opinions, sat in wait.",
    "We were good for a throwing."
