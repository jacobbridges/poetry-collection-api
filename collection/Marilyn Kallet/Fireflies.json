    "In the dry summer field at nightfall,",
    "fireflies rise like sparks.",
    "Imagine the presence of ghosts",
    "flickering, the ghosts of young friends,",
    "your father nearest in the distance.",
    "This time they carry no sorrow,",
    "no remorse, their presence is so light.",
    "Childhood comes to you,",
    "memories of your street in lamplight,",
    "holding those last moments before bed,",
    "capturing lightning-bugs,",
    "with a blossom of the hand",
    "letting them go. Lightness returns,",
    "an airy motion over the ground",
    "you remember from Ring Around the Rosie.",
    "If you stay, the fireflies become fireflies",
    "again, not part of your stories,",
    "as unaware of you as sleep, being",
    "beautiful and quiet all around you."
