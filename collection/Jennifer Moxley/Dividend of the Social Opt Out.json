    "How lovely it is not to go. To suddenly take ill.",
    "Not seriously ill, just a little under the weather.",
    "To feel slightly peaked, indisposed. Plagued by",
    "a vague ache, or a slight inexplicable chill.",
    "Perhaps such pleasures are denied",
    "to those who never feel obliged. If there are such.",
    "How pleasant to convey your regrets. To feel sincerely",
    "sorry, but secretly pleased to send them on their way",
    "without you. To entrust your good wishes to others.",
    "To spare the equivocal its inevitable rise.",
    "How nice not to hope that something will happen,",
    "but to lie on the couch with a book, hoping that",
    "nothing will. To hear the wood creak and to think.",
    "It is lovely to stay without wanting to leave.",
    "How delicious not to care how you look,",
    "clean and uncombed in the sheets. To sip",
    "brisk mineral water, to take small bites",
    "off crisp Saltines. To leave some on the plate.",
    "To fear no repercussions. Nor dodge",
    "the unkind person you bug.",
    "Even the caretaker has gone to the party.",
    "If you want something you will have to",
    "get it yourself. The blue of the room seduces.",
    "The cars of the occupied sound the wet road.",
    "You indulge in a moment of sadness, make",
    "a frown at the notion you won't be missed.",
    "This is what it is. You have opted to be",
    "forgotten so that your thoughts might live."
