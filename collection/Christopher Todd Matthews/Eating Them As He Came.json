    "Dark by five, the day gives up and so do I,",
    "stalled at the top of the stairs I forget what for,",
    "adrift in a scrap of dream that\u2019s not a dream",
    "exactly but a stupor, unrefined. I go astray",
    "in old routines, I dare myself to reconstruct",
    "the rules of old invented games\u2014that one",
    "of throwing snowballs at the roof, to watch them",
    "shrink as they rolled down, spinning to their pits,",
    "to see the force that made them briefly a thing",
    "so neatly undone. Today an old friend\u2019s tiny boy",
    "lobbied me to pitch some snowballs at him. I bowed",
    "to his dense little will. But planned to miss.",
    "As I packed and flung each one to its unpacking,",
    "he hunted down the humble bits and crumbs",
    "of every impact, as they ran from him along",
    "the icy slope, and gathered and carried them",
    "back to me at the top. Eating them as he came.",
    "So that\u2019s how you get to the marrow of breakdown.",
    "I forgot. That you could put what\u2019s left to your lips."
