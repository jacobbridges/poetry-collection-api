    "Left a hole on fire agony or was it the sun",
    "on the banks and near duets?",
    "Eagles with the white wine of the sun",
    "clink and spill, tall",
    "grass over head and heels",
    ". . . Space of hell: shy, inscribed already",
    "but alone\u2014 I think I can be that",
    "again, a new hole in the ongoing flute.",
    "In a leap, the country glows\u2014 to hone",
    "the fate that wonder exacts,",
    "to go netted through that much,",
    "so heavy as paperweights angels land",
    "square on chaparral nerves.",
    "And since names must give in spades,",
    "out of sorts like these, your reactions",
    "may swell great fountain lips\u2014",
    "a promise that a wish will purge",
    "or pennies caravan the safe",
    "return hearts cross."
