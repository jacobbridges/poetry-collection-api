    "If Heaven has into being deigned to call",
    "Thy light, O Liberty! to shine on all;",
    "Bright intellectual Sun! why does thy ray",
    "To earth distribute only partial day?",
    "Since no resisting cause from",
    "flows",
    "Thy universal presence to oppose;",
    "No obstacles by Nature\u2019s hand impressed,",
    "Thy subtle and ethereal beams arrest;",
    "Not swayed by",
    "is they course benign,",
    "Or more direct or more oblique to shine;",
    "Nor motion\u2019s laws can speed thy active course;",
    "Nor strong repulsion\u2019s powers obstruct thy force:",
    "Since there is no convexity in mind,",
    "Why are thy genial rays to parts confined?",
    "While the chill North with thy bright beam is blest,",
    "Why should fell darkness half the South invest?",
    "Was it decreed, fair Freedom! at thy birth,",
    "That thou should\u2019st ne\u2019er irradiate",
    "the earth?",
    "While Britain basks in thy full blaze of light,",
    "Why lies sad Afric quenched in total night?",
    "Thee only,",
    "Goddess! I attest,",
    "In smiles chastised, and decent graces dressed;",
    "To thee alone, pure daughter of the skies,",
    "The hallowed incense of the Bard should rise:",
    "Not that mad Liberty, in whose wild praise",
    "Too oft he trims his prostituted bays;",
    "Not that unlicensed monster of the crowd,",
    "Whose roar terrific bursts in peals so loud,",
    "Deafening the ear of Peace; fierce Faction\u2019s tool,",
    "Of rash Sedition born, and mad Misrule;",
    "Whose stubborn mouth, rejecting Reason\u2019s rein,",
    "No strength can govern, and no skill restrain;",
    "Whose magic cries the frantic vulgar draw",
    "To spurn at Order, and to outrage Law;",
    "To tread on grave Authority and Power,",
    "And shake the work of ages in an hour:",
    "Convulsed her voice, and pestilent her breath,",
    "She raves of mercy, while she deals out death:",
    "Each blast is fate; she darts from either hand",
    "Red conflagration o\u2019er the astonished land;",
    "Clamouring for peace, she rends the air with noise,",
    "And, to reform a part, the whole destroys.",
    "Reviles oppression only to oppress,",
    "And, in the act of murder, breathes redress.",
    "Such have we seen on Freedom\u2019s genuine coast,",
    "Bellowing for blessings which were never lost.",
    "\u2018Tis past, and Reason rules the lucid hour,",
    "And beauteous Order reassumes his power:",
    "Lord of the bright ascendant may he reign,",
    "Till perfect Peace eternal sway maintain!",
    "O, plaintive Southerne! whose impassioned page",
    "Can melt the soul to grief, or rouse to rage;",
    "Now, when congenial themes engage the Muse,",
    "She burns to emulate thy generous views;",
    "Her failing efforts mock her fond desires,",
    "She shares thy feelings, not partakes thy fires.",
    "Strange power of song! the strain that warms the heart",
    "Seems the same inspiration to impart;",
    "Touched by the extrinsic energy alone,",
    "We think the flame which melts us is our own;",
    "Deceived, for genius we mistake delight,",
    "Charmed as we read, we fancy we can write.",
    "Though not to me, sweet Bard, thy powers belong,",
    "The cause I plead shall sanctify my song.",
    "The Muse awakes no artificial fire,",
    "For Truth rejects what Fancy would inspire:",
    "Here Art would weave her gayest flowers in vain,",
    "The bright invention Nature would disdain.",
    "For no fictitious ills these numbers flow,",
    "But living anguish, and substantial woe;",
    "No individual griefs my bosom melt,",
    "For millions feel what Oroonoko felt:",
    "Fired by no single wrongs, the countless host",
    "I mourn, by rapine dragg\u2019d from Afric\u2019s coast.",
    "Perish the illiberal thought which would debase",
    "The native genius of the sable race!",
    "Perish the proud philosophy, which sought",
    "To rob them of the powers of equal thought!",
    "What! does the immortal principle within",
    "Change with the casual colour of a skin?",
    "Does matter govern spirit? or is mind",
    "Degraded by the form to which it\u2019s joined?",
    "No: they have heads to think, and hearts to feel,",
    "And souls to act, with firm, though erring zeal;",
    "For they have keen affections, soft desires,",
    "Love strong as death, and active patriot fires:",
    "All the rude energy, the fervid flame",
    "Of high-souled passion, and ingenuous shame:",
    "Strong, but luxuriant virtues, boldly shoot",
    "From the wild vigour of a savage root.",
    "Nor weak their sense of honour\u2019s proud control,",
    "For pride is virtue in a Pagan soul;",
    "A sense of worth, a conscience of desert,",
    "A high, unbroken haughtiness of heart;",
    "That selfsame stuff which erst proud empires swayed,",
    "Of which the conquerors of the world were made.",
    "Capricious fate of men! that very pride",
    "In Afric scourged, in Rome was deified.",
    "No Muse, O Qua-shi! shall thy deeds relate,",
    "No statue snatch thee from oblivious fate!",
    "For thou wast born where never gentle Muse",
    "On Valour\u2019s grave the flowers of Genius strews;",
    "And thou wast born where no recording page",
    "Plucks the fair deed from Time\u2019s devouring rage.",
    "Had fortune placed you on some happier coast,",
    "Where",
    "Pagans souls heroic boast,",
    "To thee, who sought\u2019st a voluntary grave,",
    "The uninjured honours of thy name to save,",
    "Whose generous arm thy barbarous Master spared,",
    "Altars had smoked, and temples had been reared.",
    "Whene\u2019er to Afric\u2019s shores I turn my eyes,",
    "Horrors of deepest, deadliest guilt arise;",
    "I see, by more than Fancy\u2019s mirror shown,",
    "The burning village, and the blazing town:",
    "See the dire victim torn from social life,",
    "See the sacred infant, hear the shrieking wife!",
    "She, wretch forlorn! is dragged by hostile hands,",
    "To distant tyrants sold, in distant lands:",
    "Transmitted miseries, and successive chains,",
    "The sole sad heritage her child obtains.",
    "E\u2019en this last wretched boon their foes deny,",
    "To weep together, or together die.",
    "By felon hands, by one relentless stroke,",
    "See the fond links of Nature broke!",
    "The fibres twisting round a parent\u2019s heart,",
    "Torn from their grasp, and bleeding as they part.",
    "Hold, murderers! hold! nor aggravate distress;",
    "Respect the passions you yourself possess:",
    "Ev\u2019n you, of ruffian heart, and ruthless hand,",
    "Love your own offspring, love your native land;",
    "Ev\u2019n you, with fond impatient feelings burn,",
    "Though free as air, though certain of return.",
    "Then, if to you, who voluntary roam,",
    "So dear the memory of your distant home,",
    "O think how absence the loved scene endears",

    "As dear his land to him as yours to you;",
    "And Liberty, in you a hallowed flame,",

    "One equal fondness of their sons command.",
    "The unconquered savage laughs at pain and toil,",
    "Basking in Freedom\u2019s beams which gild his native soil.",
    "Does thirst of empire, does desire of fame,",
    "(For these are specious crimes) our rage inflame?",
    "No: sordid lust of gold their fate controls,",
    "The basest appetite of basest souls;",
    "Gold, better gained by what their ripening sky,",
    "Their fertile fields, their arts, and mines supply.",
    "What wrongs, what injuries does Oppression plead",
    "To smooth the crime and sanctify the deed?",
    "What strange offence, what aggravated sin?",
    "They stand convicted \u2014 of a darker skin!",
    "Barbarians, hold! the opprobrious commerce spare,",

    "The outraged Goddess, with abhorrent eyes,",
    "Sees Man the traffic, souls the merchandise!",
    "Man, whom fair Commerce taught with judging eye,",
    "And liberal hand, to barter or to buy,",
    "Indignant Nature blushes to behold,",
    "Degraded man himself, trucked, bartered, sold;",
    "Of every native privilege bereft,",
    "Yet cursed with every wounded feeling left.",
    "Hard lot! each brutal suffering to sustain,",
    "Yet keep the sense acute of human pain.",
    "Plead not, in reason\u2019s palpable abuse,",
    "Their sense of feeling callous and obtuse,",
    "From heads to hearts lies Nature\u2019s plain appeal,",

    "Though wit may boast a livelier dread of shame,",
    "A loftier sense of wrong, refinement claim;",

    "Yet natural evils are the same to all.",
