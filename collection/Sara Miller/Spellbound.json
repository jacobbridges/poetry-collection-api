    "Two women on a train",
    "sit beside me.",
    "I am young and the world",
    "is flying and I am watching.",
    "One of them is frosty.",
    "The other turns like a leaf",
    "to hand me something \u2014",
    "it looked for all the world like a page.",
    "I thought at the time",
    "that it needed me and I was right.",
    "The letters fell into place",
    "and simple flowers grew.",
    "Now it talks unceasingly",
    "in long white verses",
    "as if at a wedding,",
    "something women understand",
    "and gently want and then regift.",
    "I myself agree with Herbert,",
    "who in a dark mood conjured",
    "the mushrooms underfoot",
    "unseen by bride or groom",
    "and with him I say, Perhaps",
    "the world is unimportant",
    "after all, though this is not",
    "what one discusses with",
    "women on a train, no matter",
    "how long the journey,",
    "or untroubled the land."
