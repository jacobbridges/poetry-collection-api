    "Underneath ice caps, once glacial peaks",
    "deer, elk, vixen begin to ascend.",
    "Free creatures camouflaged as",
    "waves and waves receding far",
    "from plains pulling",
    "upward slopes and faraway snow dusted mountains.",
    "On spotted and clear cut hills robbed of fir,",
    "high above wheat tapestried valleys, flood plains",
    "up where headwaters reside.",
    "Droplets pound, listen.",
    "Hoofed and pawed mammals",
    "pawing and hoofing themselves up, up.",
    "Along rivers dammed by chocolate beavers,",
    "trailed by salamanders\u2014mud puppies.",
    "Plunging through currents,",
    "above concrete and steel man-made barriers",
    "these populations of plains, prairies, forests flee",
    "in such frenzy, popping splash dance,",
    "pillaging cattail zones, lashing lily pads\u2014",
    "the breath of life in muddy ponds, still lakes.",
    "Liquid beads slide on windshield glass",
    "along cracked and shattered pane,",
    "spider-like with webs and prisms.",
    "\u201cLook, there, the rainbow",
    "touched the ground both ends down!\u201d",
    "Full arch seven colors showered, heed",
    "what Indigenous know, why long ago,",
    "they said no one belongs here, surrounding them,",
    "that this land was meant to be wet with waters of nearby",
    "not fertile to crops and domestic graze.",
    "The old ones said,",
    "\u201cWhen the animals leave this place",
    "the waters will come again.",
    "This power is beyond the strength of man.",
    "The river will return with its greatest force.\u201d",
    "No one can stop her.",
    "She was meant to be this way.",
    "Snakes in honor, do not intrude.",
    "The rainbow tied with red and green like",
    "that on petal rose, though only momentarily.",
    "Colors disappear like print photographs fade.",
    "They mix with charcoal surrounding.",
    "A flurry of fowl follow",
    "like strands, maidenhair falls,",
    "from blackened clouds above",
    "swarming inward",
    "covering the basin and raising sky.",
    "Darkness hangs over",
    "the hills appear as black water crests,",
    "blackness varying shades.",
    "The sun is somewhere farther than the farthest ridge .",
    "Main gravel crossroads and back back roads",
    "slicken to mud, clay.",
    "Turtles creep along rising banks, snapping jowls.",
    "Frogs chug throaty songs.",
    "The frogs only part of immense choir",
    "heralding the downpour, the falling oceans.",
    "Over the train trestle, suspension bridge with",
    "current so slick everything slides off in sheets.",
    "Among rotten stumps in black bass ponds,",
    "somewhere catfish reel in fins and crawl,",
    "walking whiskers to higher waters.",
    "Waters above, below",
    "the choir calling it forth.",
    "Brightly plumed jays and dull brown-headed cowbirds",
    "fly as if hung in one place like pinwheels.",
    "They dance toward the rain crest,",
    "the approaching storm",
    "beckoning, inviting, summoning.",
    "A single sparrow sings the stroke of rain",
    "past the strength of sunlight.",
    "The frog chorus sings refrain,",
    "melody drumming thunder,",
    "evoked by beasts and water creatures wanting their homes.",
    "Wanting to return to clearings and streams where ash, or",
    "white birch woods rise, tower over,",
    "quaking aspen stand against",
    "storm shown veils\u2014sheeting rains crossing",
    "pasture, meadow, hills, mountain.",
    "Sounds erupt.",
    "Gathering clouds converge, push,",
    "pull, push, pull forcing lightning",
    "back and forth shaping",
    "windy, sculptured swans, mallard ducks, and giants",
    "from stratocumulus media.",
    "As if they are a living cloud chamber,",
    "As if they exist only in the heavens.",
    "Air swells with dampness.",
    "It has begun."
