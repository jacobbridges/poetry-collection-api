    "Thirteen years ago, before bulk barns and",
    "fifth gear diesel tractors, we rode royal blue tractors with",
    "toolboxes big enough to hold a six pack on ice.",
    "In the one hundred fifteen degree summer",
    "heat with air so thick with moisture",
    "you drink as you breathe.",
    "Before the year dusters sprayed",
    "malathion over our clustered bodies, perspiring",
    "while we primed bottom lugs,",
    "those ground level leaves of tobacco,",
    "and it clung to us with black tar so sticky we rolled",
    "eight-inch balls off our arms at night and",
    "Cloroxed our clothes for hours and hours.",
    "Before we were poisoned and",
    "the hospital thought we had been burned in fires,",
    "at least to the third degree,",
    "when the raw, oozing hives that",
    "covered ninety-eight percent of our bodies",
    "from the sprays ordered by the FDA",
    "and spread by landowners,",
    "before anyone had seen",
    "automated machines that top and prime.",
    "While we topped the lavender",
    "blooms of many tiny flowers",
    "gathered into one, gorgeous.",
    "By grasping hold below the petals",
    "with our bare, calloused hands",
    "and twisting downward, quick, hard,",
    "only one time, snapped them off.",
    "Before edgers and herbicides took",
    "what",
    "call weeds,",
    "when we walked for days",
    "through thirty acres and",
    "chopped them out with hoes.",
    "Hoes, made long before from wood and steel",
    "and sometimes (even longer ago)",
    "from wood and deer scapula.",
    "Before the bulk primers came",
    "and we primed all the leaves by hand,",
    "stooped over at the waist for the",
    "lower ones and through the season",
    "gradually rising higher until we stood",
    "and worked simultaneously,",
    "as married to the fields as we were to each other,",
    "carrying up to fifty pounds of fresh",
    "leaves under each arm and sewing them onto",
    "sticks four feet long on a looper",
    "under the shade of a tin-roofed barn, made of shingle,",
    "and poking it up through the rafters inside",
    "to be caught by a hanger who",
    "poked it up higher in the rafters to another",
    "who held a higher position",
    "and so they filled the barn.",
    "And the leaves hung down",
    "like butterfly wings, though",
    "sometimes the color of",
    "luna moths, or Carolina parakeets, when just",
    "an hour ago they had been",
    "laid upon the old wooden",
    "cart trailers pulled behind",
    "the orange Allis-Chalmers tractor",
    "with huge, round fenders and only",
    "a screwdriver and salt in the toolbox,",
    "picked by primers so hot",
    "we would race through the rows",
    "to reach the twenty-five gallon",
    "jugs of water placed throughout",
    "the field to encourage and in attempt to",
    "satisfy our insatiable thirsts",
    "from drinking air which poured",
    "through our pores without breaking",
    "through to our need for more",
    "water in the sun.",
    "Sun we imagined to disappear",
    "yet respected for growing all things on earth",
    "when quenched with rains called forth",
    "by our song and drumming.",
    "Leaves, which weeks later, would be",
    "taken down and the strings pulled",
    "like string on top of a large dog-food bag",
    "and sheeted up into burlap sheets",
    "that bundled over a hundred pounds",
    "when we smashed down with our feet,",
    "but gently smashing,",
    "then thrown up high to",
    "a catcher on a big clapboard trailer",
    "pulled behind two-ton trucks and",
    "taken to market in Fuquay-Varina",
    "and sold to Philip Morris and",
    "Winston-Salem for around a buck a pound.",
    "Leaves cured to a bright leaf,",
    "a golden yellow with the strongest",
    "aroma of tobacco barn curing",
    "and hand grown quality",
    "before the encroachment of",
    "big business in the Reagan era",
    "and the slow murder of method",
    "from a hundred years before.",
    "When the loons cried out in",
    "laughter by the springs and",
    "the bass popped the surface on",
    "the pond, early on, next to",
    "the fields, before that time",
    "when it was unfashionable to",
    "transplant each individual baby plant,",
    "the infant tobacco we nurtured, to",
    "transplant those seedlings to each hill",
    "in the field, the space for that particular plant",
    "and we watched as they would grow.",
    "Before all of this new age, new way,",
    "I was a sharecropper in Willow Springs, North Carolina,",
    "as were you and we were proud to be Tsa la gi",
    "wishing for winter so we could make camp",
    "at Qualla Boundary and Oconaluftee",
    "would be free of tourists and filled with snow",
    "and those of us who held out forever",
    "and had no CIBs would be home again",
    "with our people, while the BIA forgot to watch.",
    "When we still remembered before even the Europeans,",
    "working now shoulder to shoulder with descendants",
    "of their slaves they brought from Africa",
    "when they sold our ancestors as slaves in the Middle East,",
    "that then the tobacco was sacred to all of us and we",
    "prayed whenever we smoked and",
    "did not smoke for pleasure and",
    "I was content and free.",
    "Then they came and changed things",
    "and you left me for a fancy white girl",
    "and I waited on the land",
    "until you brought her back",
    "in that brand new white Trans Am,",
    "purchased from our crop, you gave her",
    "and left her waiting in a motel.",
    "The nearest one was forty miles away,",
    "but near enough for you",
    "and for her and I knew though",
    "I never spoke a word to you",
    "about it, I knew and I kept it to",
    "myself to this day and time and",
    "I never let on",
    "until I left on our anniversary.",
    "I drove the pick-up",
    "down the dirt path by the empty fields",
    "and rented a shack for eighty dollars,",
    "the one with cardboard windows",
    "and a Gillespie house floor design,",
    "with torn and faded floral paper on walls",
    "and linoleum so thin over rotted board",
    "that the floor gave if you weighed over",
    "a hundred pounds. I did not.",
    "And with no running water of any kind, or bathroom.",
    "The one at hilltop, where I could",
    "see out across all the fields",
    "and hunt for meat when I wanted",
    "and find peace.",
    "I heard you remarried",
    "and went into automated farming",
    "and kept up with America.",
    "I watched all of you from the hill",
    "and I waited for the lavender blooms",
    "to return and when it was spring",
    "even the blooms had turned white.",
    "I rolled up my bedroll, remembering before,",
    "when the fields were like waves on a green ocean,",
    "and turned away, away from the change",
    "and corruption of big business on small farms",
    "of traditional agricultural people, and sharecroppers.",
    "Away, so that I could always hold this concise image",
    "of before that time and it",
    "floods my memory."
