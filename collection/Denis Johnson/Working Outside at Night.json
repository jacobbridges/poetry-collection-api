    "The moon swells",
    "and its yellow darkens",

    "shall appear, orange",
    "and distinct beside",
    "the orange sun,",

    "have been awful, and when",
    "around five the roosters",
    "alone on neighboring",
    "small farms begin",
    "to scream like humans",
    "my heart just lies down,",
    "a stone."
