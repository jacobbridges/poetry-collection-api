    "You are food.",

    "eggs with yellow sauce, muffins",
    "torn apart and leaking butter, fried meats",
    "late in the morning, and always sweets",
    "in a sticky parade from the kitchen.",
    "His vigilance, an ice pick of hunger",
    "pricking his insides, will melt",
    "in the unctuous cream fillings.",
    "He will forget. He will thank you",
    "for it. His little finger stuck every day",
    "through cracks in the bars",
    "will grow sleek and round,",
    "his hollow face swell",
    "like the moon. He will stop dreaming",
    "about fear in the woods without food.",
    "He will lean toward the maw",
    "of the oven as it opens",
    "every afternoon, sighing",
    "better and better smells."
