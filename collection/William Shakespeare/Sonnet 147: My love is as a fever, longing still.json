    "My love is as a fever, longing still",
    "For that which longer nurseth the disease,",
    "Feeding on that which doth preserve the ill,",
    "Th\u2019 uncertain sickly appetite to please.",
    "My reason, the physician to my love,",
    "Angry that his prescriptions are not kept,",
    "Hath left me, and I desperate now approve",
    "Desire is death, which physic did except.",
    "Past cure I am, now reason is past care,",
    "And frantic-mad with evermore unrest;",
    "My thoughts and my discourse as madmen\u2019s are,",
    "At random from the truth vainly expressed:",
    "For I have sworn thee fair, and thought thee bright,",
    "Who art as black as hell, as dark as night."
