    "Alas, 'tis true I have gone here and there",
    "And made myself a motley to the view,",
    "Gor'd mine own thoughts, sold cheap what is most dear,",
    "Made old offences of affections new.",
    "Most true it is that I have look'd on truth",
    "Askance and strangely: but, by all above,",
    "These blenches gave my heart another youth,",
    "And worse essays prov'd thee my best of love.",
    "Now all is done, have what shall have no end!",
    "Mine appetite, I never more will grind",
    "On newer proof, to try an older friend,",
    "A god in love, to whom I am confin'd.",
    "Then give me welcome, next my heaven the best,",
    "Even to thy pure and most most loving breast."
