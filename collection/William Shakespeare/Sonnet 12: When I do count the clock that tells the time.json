    "When I do count the clock that tells the time,",
    "And see the brave day sunk in hideous night;",
    "When I behold the violet past prime,",
    "And sable curls ensilvered o\u2019er with white;",
    "When lofty trees I see barren of leaves,",
    "Which erst from heat did canopy the herd,",
    "And summer\u2019s green all girded up in sheaves",
    "Borne on the bier with white and bristly beard:",
    "Then of thy beauty do I question make",
    "That thou among the wastes of time must go,",
    "Since sweets and beauties do themselves forsake,",
    "And die as fast as they see others grow;",
    "And nothing 'gainst time\u2019s scythe can make defence",
    "Save breed to brave him when he takes thee hence."
