    "In the season leaves should love,",
    "since it gives them leave to move",
    "through the wind, towards the ground",
    "they were watching while they hung,",
    "legend says there is a seam",
    "stitching darkness like a name.",
    "Now when dying grasses veil",
    "earth from the sky in one last pale",
    "wave, as autumn dies to bring",
    "winter back, and then the spring,",
    "we who die ourselves can peel",
    "back another kind of veil",
    "that hangs among us like thick smoke.",
    "Tonight at last I feel it shake.",
    "I feel the nights stretching away",
    "thousands long behind the days",
    "till they reach the darkness where",
    "all of me is ancestor.",
    "I move my hand and feel a touch",
    "move with me, and when I brush",
    "my own mind across another,",
    "I am with my mother's mother.",
    "Sure as footsteps in my waiting",
    "self, I find her, and she brings",
    "arms that carry answers for me,",
    "intimate, a waiting bounty.",
    "\"Carry me.\" She leaves this trail",
    "through a shudder of the veil,",
    "and leaves, like amber where she stays,",
    "a gift for her perpetual gaze."
