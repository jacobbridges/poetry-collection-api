    "England, with all thy faults, I love thee still",
    "My country! and while yet a nook is left",
    "Where English minds and manners may be found,",
    "Shall be constrain\u2019d to love thee. Though thy clime",
    "Be fickle, and thy year, most part, deform\u2019d",
    "With dripping rains, or wither\u2019d by a frost,",
    "I would not yet exchange thy sullen skies",
    "And fields without a flow\u2019r, for warmer France",
    "With all her vines; nor for Ausonia\u2019s groves",
    "Of golden fruitage and her myrtle bow\u2019rs.",
    "To shake thy senate, and from heights sublime",
    "Of patriot eloquence to flash down fire",
    "Upon thy foes, was never meant my task:",
    "But I can feel thy fortunes, and partake",
    "Thy joys and sorrows with as true a heart",
    "As any thund\u2019rer there. And I can feel",
    "Thy follies too, and with a just disdain",
    "Frown at effeminates, whose very looks",
    "Reflect dishonour on the land I love.",
    "How, in the name of soldiership and sense,",
    "Should England prosper, when such things, as smooth",
    "And tender as a girl, all essenc\u2019d o\u2019er",
    "With odors, and as profligate as sweet,",
    "Who sell their laurel for a myrtle wreath,",
    "And love when they should fight; when such as these",
    "Presume to lay their hand upon the ark",
    "Of her magnificent and awful cause?",
    "Time was when it was praise and boast enough",
    "In ev\u2019ry clime, and travel where we might,",
    "That we were born her children. Praise enough",
    "To fill th\u2019 ambition of a private man,",
    "That Chatham\u2019s language was his mother tongue,",
    "And Wolfe\u2019s great name compatriot with his own.",
    "Farewell those honors, and farewell with them",
    "The hope of such hereafter! They have fall\u2019n",
    "Each in his field of glory: one in arms,",
    "And one in council. Wolfe upon the lap",
    "Of smiling victory that moment won,",
    "And Chatham, heart-sick of his country\u2019s shame.",
    "They made us many soldiers. Chatham still",
    "Consulting England\u2019s happiness at home,",
    "Secur\u2019d it by an unforgiving frown",
    "If any wrong\u2019d her. Wolfe, where\u2019er he fought,",
    "Put so much of his heart into his act,",
    "That his example had a magnet\u2019s force,",
    "And all were swift to follow whom all loved.",
    "Those suns are set. Oh rise some other such!",
    "Or all that we have left is empty talk",
    "Of old achievements, and despair of new.",
    ". . .",
    "There is a pleasure in poetic pains",
    "Which only poets know. The shifts and turns,",
    "Th\u2019 expedients and inventions multiform",
    "To which the mind resorts, in chase of terms",
    "Thought apt, yet coy, and difficult to win\u2014",
    "T\u2019 arrest the fleeting images that fill",
    "The mirror of the mind, and hold them fast,",
    "And force them sit, \u2019till he has pencill\u2019d off",
    "A faithful likeness of the forms he views;",
    "Then to dispose his copies with such art",
    "That each may find its most propitious light,",
    "And shine by situation, hardly less,",
    "Than by the labor and the skill it cost,",
    "Are occupations of the poet\u2019s mind",
    "So pleasing, and that steal away the thought",
    "With such address from themes of sad import,",
    "That lost in his own musings, happy man!",
    "He feels th\u2019 anxieties of life, denied",
    "Their wonted entertainment, all retire.",
    "Such joys has he that sings. But ah! not such,",
    "Or seldom such, the hearers of his song.",
    "Fastidious, or else listless, or perhaps",
    "Aware of nothing arduous in a task",
    "They never undertook, they little note",
    "His dangers or escapes, and haply find",
    "There least amusement where he found the most.",
    "But is amusement all? studious of song,",
    "And yet ambitious not to sing in vain,",
    "I would not trifle merely, though the world",
    "Be loudest in their praise who do no more.",
    "Yet what can satire, whether grave or gay?",
    "It may correct a foible, may chastise",
    "The freaks of fashion, regulate the dress,",
    "Retrench a sword-blade, or displace a patch;",
    "But where are its sublimer trophies found?",
    "What vice has it subdu\u2019d? whose heart reclaim\u2019d",
    "By rigour, or whom laugh\u2019d into reform?",
    "Alas! Leviathan is not so tam\u2019d:",
    "Laugh\u2019d at, he laughs again; and, stricken hard,",
    "Turns to the stroke his adamantine scales,",
    "That fear no discipline of human hands.",
    "The pulpit, therefore (and I name it, fill\u2019d",
    "With solemn awe, that bids me well beware",
    "With what intent I touch that holy thing)",
    "The pulpit (when the sat\u2019rist has at last,",
    "Strutting and vap\u2019ring in an empty school,",
    "Spent all his force and made no proselyte)",
    "I say the pulpit (in the sober use",
    "Of its legitimate, peculiar pow\u2019rs)",
    "Must stand acknowledg\u2019d, while the world shall stand,",
    "The most important and effectual guard,",
    "Support and ornament of virtue\u2019s cause."
