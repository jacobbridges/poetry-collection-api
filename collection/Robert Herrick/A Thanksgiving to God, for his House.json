    "Lord, Thou hast given me a cell",
    "Wherein to dwell,",
    "A little house, whose humble roof",
    "Is weather-proof:",
    "Under the spars of which I lie",
    "Both soft, and dry;",
    "Where Thou my chamber for to ward",
    "Hast set a guard",
    "Of harmless thoughts, to watch and keep",
    "Me, while I sleep.",
    "Low is my porch, as is my fate,",
    "Both void of state;",
    "And yet the threshold of my door",
    "Is worn by th' poor,",
    "Who thither come and freely get",
    "Good words, or meat.",
    "Like as my parlour, so my hall",
    "And kitchen's small;",
    "A little buttery, and therein",
    "A little bin,",
    "Which keeps my little loaf of bread",
    "Unchipp'd, unflead;",
    "Some brittle sticks of thorn or briar",
    "Make me a fire,",
    "Close by whose living coal I sit,",
    "And glow like it.",
    "Lord, I confess too, when I dine,",
    "The pulse is Thine,",
    "And all those other bits, that be",
    "There plac'd by Thee;",
    "The worts, the purslain, and the mess",
    "Of water-cress,",
    "Which of Thy kindness Thou hast sent;",
    "And my content",
    "Makes those, and my beloved beet,",
    "To be more sweet.",
    "'Tis Thou that crown'st my glittering hearth",
    "With guiltless mirth;",
    "And giv'st me wassail-bowls to drink,",
    "Spic'd to the brink.",
    "Lord, 'tis Thy plenty-dropping hand",
    "That soils my land;",
    "And giv'st me, for my bushel sown,",
    "Twice ten for one;",
    "Thou mak'st my teeming hen to lay",
    "Her egg each day;",
    "Besides my healthful ewes to bear",
    "Me twins each year;",
    "The while the conduits of my kine",
    "Run cream, for wine.",
    "All these, and better, Thou dost send",
    "Me, to this end,",
    "That I should render, for my part,",
    "A thankful heart,",
    "Which, fir'd with incense, I resign,",
    "As wholly Thine;",
    "But the acceptance, that must be,",
    "My Christ, by Thee."
