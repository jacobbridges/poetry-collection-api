    "From the dull confines of the drooping west",
    "To see the day spring from the pregnant east,",
    "Ravish'd in spirit, I come, nay more, I fly",
    "To thee, blest place of my nativity!",
    "Thus, thus with hallow'd foot I touch the ground,",
    "With thousand blessings by thy fortune crown'd.",
    "O fruitful genius! that bestowest here",
    "An everlasting plenty, year by year.",
    "O place! O people! Manners! fram'd to please",
    "All nations, customs, kindreds, languages!",
    "I am a free-born Roman; suffer then",
    "That I amongst you live a citizen.",
    "London my home is, though by hard fate sent",
    "Into a long and irksome banishment;",
    "Yet since call'd back, henceforward let me be,",
    "O native country, repossess'd by thee!",
    "For, rather than I'll to the west return,",
    "I'll beg of thee first here to have mine urn.",
    "Weak I am grown, and must in short time fall;",
    "Give thou my sacred relics burial."
