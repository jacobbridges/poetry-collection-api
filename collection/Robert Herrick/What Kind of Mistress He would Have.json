    "Be the mistress of my choice,",
    "Clean in manners, clear in voice;",
    "Be she witty, more than wise,",
    "Pure enough, though not precise;",
    "Be she showing in her dress,",
    "Like a civil wilderness,",
    "That the curious may detect",
    "Order in a sweet neglect;",
    "Be she rolling in her eye,",
    "Tempting all the passers by;",
    "And each ringlet of her hair,",
    "An enchantment, or a snare,",
    "For to catch the lookers on;",
    "But herself held fast by none.",
    "Let her Lucrece all day be,",
    "Thais in the night, to me.",
    "Be she such, as neither will",
    "Famish me, nor overfill."
