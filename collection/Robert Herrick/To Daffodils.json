    "Fair Daffodils, we weep to see",

    "Until the hasting day",
    "Has run",
    "But to the even-song;",
    "And, having pray'd together, we",
    "Will go with you along.",
    "We have short time to stay, as you,",
    "We have as short a spring;",
    "As quick a growth to meet decay,",
    "As you, or anything.",
    "We die",
    "As your hours do, and dry",
    "Away,",
    "Like to the summer's rain;",
    "Or as the pearls of morning's dew,",
    "Ne'er to be found again."
