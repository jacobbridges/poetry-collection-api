    "In sober mornings do thou not rehearse",
    "The holy incantation of a verse;",
    "But when that men have both well drunk, and fed,",
    "Let my enchantments then be sung, or read.",
    "When laurel spurts i' th' fire, and when the hearth",
    "Smiles to itself, and gilds the roof with mirth;",
    "When up the thyrse is raised, and when the sound",
    "Of sacred orgies flies: \"A round, a round;\"",
    "When the rose reigns, and locks with ointments shine,",
    "Let rigid Cato read these lines of mine."
