    "Can I not sin, but thou wilt be",
    "My private protonotary?",
    "Can I not woo thee to pass by",
    "A short and sweet iniquity?",
    "I'll cast a mist and cloud upon",
    "My delicate transgression,",
    "So utter dark as that no eye",
    "Shall see the hugg'd impiety.",
    "Gifts blind the wise, and bribes do please,",
    "And wind all other witnesses;",
    "And wilt not thou with gold be tied",
    "To lay thy pen and ink aside,",
    "That in the murk and tongueless night",
    "Wanton I may, and thou not write?",
    "It will not be; and therefore, now,",
    "For times to come I'll make this vow,",
    "From aberrations to live free,",
    "So I'll not fear the Judge, or thee."
