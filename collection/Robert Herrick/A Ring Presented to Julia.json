    "Julia, I bring",
    "To thee this ring,",
    "Made for thy finger fit;",

    "That our love is",
    "(Or should be) like to it.",
    "Close though it be,",
    "The joint is free;",
    "So when Love\u2019s yoke is on,",
    "It must not gall,",
    "Or fret at all",
    "With hard oppression.",
    "But it must play",
    "Still either way,",
    "And be, too, such a yoke",
    "As not too wide",
    "To overslide,",
    "Or be so strait to choke.",
    "So we who bear",
    "This beam must rear",
    "Ourselves to such a height",
    "As that the stay",
    "Of either may",
    "Create the burden light.",
    "And as this round",
    "Is nowhere found",
    "To flaw, or else to sever;",
    "So let our love",
    "As endless prove,",
    "And pure as gold for ever."
