    "I sing of brooks, of blossoms, birds, and bowers,",
    "Of April, May, of June, and July flowers.",
    "I sing of May-poles, hock-carts, wassails, wakes,",
    "Of bridegrooms, brides, and of their bridal-cakes.",
    "I write of youth, of love, and have access",
    "By these to sing of cleanly wantonness.",
    "I sing of dews, of rains, and piece by piece",
    "Of balm, of oil, of spice, and ambergris.",
    "I sing of Time's trans-shifting; and I write",
    "How roses first came red, and lilies white.",
    "I write of groves, of twilights, and I sing",
    "The court of Mab, and of the fairy king.",
    "I write of Hell; I sing (and ever shall)",
    "Of Heaven, and hope to have it after all."
