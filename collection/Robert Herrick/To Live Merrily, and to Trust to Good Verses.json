    "Now is the time for mirth,",
    "Nor cheek or tongue be dumb;",

    "The golden pomp is come;",
    "For now each tree does wear,",
    "Made of her pap and gum,",
    "Rich beads of amber here.",
    "Now reigns the rose, and now",
    "Th' Arabian dew besmears",
    "My uncontrolled brow",
    "And my retorted hairs.",
    "Homer, this health to thee,",
    "In sack of such a kind",
    "That it would make thee see",
    "Though thou wert ne'er so blind.",
    "Next, Virgil I'll call forth",
    "To pledge this second health",
    "In wine, whose each cup's worth",

    "A goblet next I'll drink",
    "To Ovid, and suppose,",
    "Made he the pledge, he'd think",
    "The world had all one nose.",

    "To that terse muse of thine.",
    "Wild I am now with heat;",
    "O Bacchus! cool thy rays!",
    "Or frantic, I shall eat",
    "Thy thyrse, and bite the bays.",
    "Round, round the roof does run;",
    "And being ravish'd thus,",
    "Come, I will drink a tun",
    "To my Propertius.",
    "Now, to Tibullus, next,",
    "This flood I drink to thee;",
    "But stay, I see a text",
    "That this presents to me.",
    "Behold, Tibullus lies",
    "Here burnt, whose small return",
    "Of ashes scarce suffice",
    "To fill a little urn.",
    "Trust to good verses then;",
    "They only will aspire,",
    "When pyramids, as men,",
    "Are lost i' th' funeral fire.",
    "And when all bodies meet,",
    "In Lethe to be drown'd,",
    "Then only numbers sweet",
    "With endless life are crown'd."
