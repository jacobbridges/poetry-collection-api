    "Weigh me the fire; or canst thou find",
    "A way to measure out the wind?",
    "Distinguish all those floods that are",
    "Mixed in that wat\u2019ry theater,",
    "And taste thou them as saltless there,",
    "As in their channel first they were.",
    "Tell me the people that do keep",
    "Within the kingdoms of the deep;",
    "Or fetch me back that cloud again,",
    "Beshivered into seeds of rain.",
    "Tell me the motes, dust, sands, and spears",
    "Of corn, when summer shakes his ears;",
    "Show me that world of stars, and whence",
    "They noiseless spill their influence.",
    "This if thou canst; then show me Him",
    "That rides the glorious cherubim."
