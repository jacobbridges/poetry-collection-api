    "Back to the flower-town, side by side,",
    "The bright months bring,",
    "New-born, the bridegroom and the bride,",

    "The sweet land laughs from sea to sea,",
    "Filled full of sun;",
    "All things come back to her, being free;",
    "All things but one.",
    "In many a tender wheaten plot",
    "Flowers that were dead",
    "Live, and old suns revive; but not",

    "By this white wandering waste of sea,",
    "Far north, I hear",
    "One face shall never turn to me",
    "As once this year:",
    "Shall never smile and turn and rest",

    "Half run before;",
    "The youngest to the oldest singer",
    "That England bore.",
    "I found him whom I shall not find",
    "Till all grief end,",
    "In holiest age our mightiest mind,",
    "Father and friend.",
    "But thou, if anything endure,",
    "If hope there be,",
    "O spirit that man's life left pure,",
    "Man's death set free,",
    "Not with disdain of days that were",
    "Look earthward now;",
    "Let dreams revive the reverend hair,",
    "The imperial brow;",
    "Come back in sleep, for in the life",
    "Where thou art not",
    "We find none like thee. Time and strife",
    "And the world's lot",
    "Move thee no more; but love at least",
    "And reverent heart",
    "May move thee, royal and released,",
    "Soul, as thou art.",
    "And thou, his Florence, to thy trust",
    "Receive and keep,",
    "Keep safe his dedicated dust,",
    "His sacred sleep.",
    "So shall thy lovers, come from far,",
    "Mix with thy name",
    "As morning-star with evening-star",
    "His faultless fame."
