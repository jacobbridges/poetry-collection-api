    "Where did you get such a dirty face,",
    "My darling dirty-faced child?",
    "I got it from crawling along in the dirt",
    "And biting two buttons off Jeremy\u2019s shirt.",
    "I got it from chewing the roots of a rose",
    "And digging for clams in the yard with my nose.",
    "I got it from peeking into a dark cave",
    "And painting myself like a Navajo brave.",
    "I got it from playing with coal in the bin",
    "And signing my name in cement with my chin.",
    "I got it from rolling around on the rug",
    "And giving the horrible dog a big hug.",
    "I got it from finding a lost silver mine",
    "And eating sweet blackberries right off the vine.",
    "I got it from ice cream and wrestling and tears",
    "And from having more fun than you\u2019ve had in years."
