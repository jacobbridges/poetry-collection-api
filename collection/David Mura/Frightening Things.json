    "After wandering years",

    "to gaze at his umbilical cord",

    "Of course",
    "fame meant nothing",
    "to him. He stood",
    "in the blazing rain",
    "in his family graveyard",
    "and as a crow squawked overhead",
    "the stones proclaimed him",
    "the last of his line. He",
    "kept feeling inside his",
    "straw raincoat for a missing",
    "limb or the hole where",
    "the wind and rain",
    "flew in. I'll get drunk",
    "tonight, he thought,",
    "and his eyelashes glistened",
    "as he trudged back",
    "to his hermit's hut",
    "to gaze again at the jar."
