    "I",
    "Said the Table to the Chair,",
    "'You can hardly be aware,",

    "II",
    "Said the Chair unto the Table,",

    "we are not able!",
    "'How foolishly you talk,",
    "'When you know we",
    "walk!'",

    "So they both went slowly down,",
    "And walked about the town",
    "With a cheerful bumpy sound,",
    "As they toddled round and round.",
    "And everybody cried,",
    "As they hastened to their side,",
    "'See! the Table and the Chair",
    "'Have come out to take the air!'",
    "IV",
    "But in going down an alley,",
    "To a castle in a valley,",
    "They completely lost their way,",
    "And wandered all the day,",
    "Till, to see them safely back,",
    "They paid a Ducky-quack,",
    "And a Beetle, and a Mouse,",
    "Who took them to their house.",
    "V",
    "Then they whispered to each other,",
    "'O delightful little brother!",
    "'What a lovely walk we've taken!",
    "'Let us dine on Beans and Bacon!'",
    "So the Ducky, and the leetle",
    "Browny-Mousy and the Beetle",
    "Dined, and danced upon their heads",
    "Till they toddled to their beds."
