    "In a cerulean ruckus",
    "Of quilts, we played house",
    "Off the big room where",
    "They laughed & slowdragged",
    "Weekends.",
    "On Friday. The jukebox pulsed",
    "A rainbow through the papery walls.",
    "We were paid a dollar to guard",
    "Each other. I was eight",
    "& S. C. Mae fourteen,",
    "As we experimented with",
    "The devil. Mill workers",
    "Changed money in the briny",
    "Glow of bootleg, overpowered",
    "By the smell of collards, catfish",
    "& candied yams. Granddaddy Gabriel",
    "Worked the cash register",
    "Beside his second wife, Rosie",
    "Belle. I heard my mother",
    "& father laugh like swimmers",
    "Underwater. A raw odor",
    "Of lilies & sweat filled the room;",
    "My cousin\u2019s hands moved over me",
    "Smooth & tough as a blues guitar.",
    "Somebody swore they saw",
    "A silhouette with a gasoline can",
    "The night S. C. Mae ran away",
    "With a woman\u2019s husband.",
    "For weeks they sifted ashes",
    "But the gutted studs & braces",
    "Only leaned against the wind,",
    "Weak as a boy & girl entwined",
    "On the floor. That June",
    "Granddaddy drove a busload",
    "Up north: the growers paid him",
    "A dollar a day for each pair of hands.",
    "He wanted to rebuild those nights,",
    "Their circle of blurred cards.",
    "The bus grunted between orchards,",
    "& by late August I had enough",
    "Fire-blackened nickels & dimes",
    "To fill a sock, but only a few pickers",
    "Came back after a season of wine-stained",
    "Greenbacks sewn inside coats",
    "& taped to the soles of their feet."
