    "Her eyelids were painted blue.",
    "When she closed her eyes the sea",
    "rolled in like ten thousand fiery chariots,",
    "leaving behind silence above",
    "below",
    "a thousand years old. He stood beneath",
    "a high arched window, gazing out",
    "at fishing boats beyond the dikes, their nets",
    "unfurled, their offshore gestures",
    "a dance of living in bluish entourage.",
    "He was only the court\u2019s chief jester.",
    "What he said",
    "did made them laugh,",
    "but lately what he sometimes thought he knew",
    "could cost him his polished tongue",
    "royal wig.",
    "He was the masked fool unmasking the emperor.",
    "Forget the revelation. Forget the briny sea.",
    "He had seen the ravishing empress naked",
    "in a forbidden pose. Her blue eye shadow.",
    "Aquamarine shells crusted with wormy mud.",
    "Anyway, if he said half of what was foretold,",
    "the great one would become a weeping boy",
    "slumped beneath the Pillars of Hercules."
