    "Fast breaks. Lay ups. With Mercury's",
    "Insignia on our sneakers,",
    "We outmaneuvered to footwork",
    "Of bad angels. Nothing but a hot",
    "Swish of strings like silk",
    "Ten feet out. In the roundhouse",
    "Labyrinth our bodies",
    "Created, we could almost",
    "Last forever, poised in midair",
    "Like storybook sea monsters.",
    "A high note hung there",
    "A long second. Off",
    "The rim. We'd corkscrew",
    "Up & dunk balls that exploded",
    "The skullcap of hope & good",
    "Intention. Lanky, all hands",
    "& feet...sprung rhythm.",
    "We were metaphysical when girls",
    "Cheered on the sidelines.",
    "Tangled up in a falling,",
    "Muscles were a bright motor",
    "Double-flashing to the metal hoop",
    "Nailed to our oak.",
    "When Sonny Boy's mama died",
    "He played nonstop all day, so hard",
    "Our backboard splintered.",
    "Glistening with sweat,",
    "We rolled the ball off",
    "Our fingertips. Trouble",
    "Was there slapping a blackjack",
    "Against an open palm.",
    "Dribble, drive to the inside,",
    "& glide like a sparrow hawk.",
    "Lay ups. Fast breaks.",
    "We had moves we didn't know",
    "We had. Our bodies spun",
    "On swivels of bone & faith,",
    "Through a lyric slipknot",
    "Of joy, & we knew we were",
    "Beautiful & dangerous."
