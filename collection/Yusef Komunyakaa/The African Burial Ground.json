    "They came as Congo, Guinea, & Angola,",
    "feet tuned to rhythms of a thumb piano.",
    "They came to work fields of barley & flax,",
    "livestock, stone & slab, brick & mortar,",
    "to make wooden barrels, some going",
    "from slave to servant & half-freeman.",
    "They built tongue & groove",
    "\u2014 wedged",
    "into their place in New Amsterdam.",
    "Decades of seasons changed the city",
    "from Dutch to York, & dream-footed",
    "hard work rattled their bones.",
    "They danced Ashanti. They lived",
    "& died. Shrouded in cloth, in cedar",
    "& pine coffins, Trinity Church",
    "owned them in six & a half acres",
    "of sloping soil. Before speculators",
    "arrived grass & weeds overtook",
    "what was most easily forgotten,",
    "& tannery shops drained there.",
    "Did descendants & newcomers",
    "shoulder rock & heave loose gravel",
    "into the landfill before building crews",
    "came, their guitars & harmonicas",
    "chasing away ghosts at lunch break?",
    "Soon, footsteps of lower Manhattan",
    "strutted overhead, back & forth",
    "between old denials & new arrivals,",
    "going from major to minor pieties,",
    "always on the go. The click of heels",
    "the tap of a drum awaking the dead."
