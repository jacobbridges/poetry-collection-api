    "When deeds splay before us",

    "first shaped us on the climbing wheel,",
    "the human mind lit by the savanna\u2019s",
    "ice star & thistle rose,",

    "Even the bedazzled brute knows",
    "when sunlight falls through leaves",
    "across honed knives on the table.",
    "If we can see it push shadows",
    "aside, growing closer, are we less",

    "a probe with an all-seeing eye,",
    "what do we need to measure",
    "kindness, every unheld breath,",
    "every unkind leapyear?",
    "Sometimes a sober voice is enough",
    "to calm the waters & drive away",
    "the false witnesses, saying, Look,",
    "here are the broken treaties Beauty",
    "brought to us earthbound sentinels."
