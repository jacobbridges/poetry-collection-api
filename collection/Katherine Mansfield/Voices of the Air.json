    "But then there comes that moment rare",
    "When, for no cause that I can find,",
    "The little voices of the air",
    "Sound above all the sea and wind.",
    "The sea and wind do then obey",
    "And sighing, sighing double notes",
    "Of double basses, content to play",
    "A droning chord for the little throats\u2014",
    "The little throats that sing and rise",
    "Up into the light with lovely ease",
    "And a kind of magical, sweet surprise",
    "To hear and know themselves for these\u2014",
    "For these little voices: the bee, the fly,",
    "The leaf that taps, the pod that breaks,",
    "The breeze on the grass-tops bending by,",
    "The shrill quick sound that the insect makes."
