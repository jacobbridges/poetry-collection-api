    "They say it is waiting for more, the snow",
    "Shrunk up to the shadow-line of walls",
    "In an arctic smouldering, an unclean salt,",
    "And will not go until the frost returns",
    "Sharpening the stars, and the fresh snow falls",
    "Piling its drifts in scallops, furls. I say",
    "Snow has left its own white geometry",
    "To measure out for the eye the way",
    "The land may lie where a too cursory reading",
    "Discovers only dip and incline leading",
    "To incline, dip, and misses the fortuitous",
    "Full variety a hillside spreads for us:",
    "It is written here in sign and exclamation,",
    "Touched-in contour and chalk-followed fold,",
    "Lines and circles finding their completion",
    "In figures less certain, figures that yet take hold",
    "On features that would stay hidden but for them:",
    "Walking, we waken these at every turn,",
    "Waken ourselves, so that our walking seems",
    "To rouse some massive sleeper out of winter dreams",
    "Whose stretching startles the whole land into life,",
    "As if it were us the cold, keen signs were seeking",
    "To pleasure and remeasure, repossess",
    "With a sense in the gathered coldness of heat and height.",
    "Well, if it's for more the snow is waiting",
    "To claim back into disguisal overnight,",
    "As though it were promising a protection",
    "From all it has transfigured, scored and bared,",
    "Now we shall know the force of what resurrection",
    "Outwaits the simplification of the snow."
