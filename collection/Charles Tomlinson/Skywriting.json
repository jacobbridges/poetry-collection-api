    "Three jets are streaking west:",
    "Trails are beginning to fray already:",
    "The third, the last set out,",
    "Climbs parallel a March sky",
    "Paying out a ruled white line:",
    "Skywriting like an incision,",
    "Such surgical precision defines",
    "The mile between it and the others",
    "Who have disappeared leaving behind",
    "Only their now ghostly tracks",
    "That still hold to the height and map",
    "Their direction with a failing clarity:",
    "The sky is higher for their passing",
    "Where the third plane scans its breadth.",
    "The mere bare blue would never have shown",
    "That vaultlike curvature overhead,",
    "Already evading the mathematics of the spot,",
    "As it blooms back, a cool canopy,",
    "A celestial meadow, needing no measure",
    "But a reconnaissant eye, an ear",
    "Aware suddenly that as they passed",
    "No sound accompanied arrival or vanishing",
    "So high were their flight-paths on a sky",
    "That has gone on expunging them since,",
    "Leaving a clean page there for chance",
    "To spread wide its unravelling hieroglyphs."
