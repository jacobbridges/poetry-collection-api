    "I summon up Panofskv from his bed",
    "Among the famous dead",
    "To build a tomb which, since I am not read,",
    "Suffers the stone\u2019s mortality instead;",
    "Which, by the common iconographies",
    "Of simple visual ease,",
    "Usurps the place of the complexities",
    "Of sound survivors once preferred to noise:",
    "Monkeys fixed on one bough, an almost holy",
    "Nightmarish sloth, a tree",
    "Of parrots in a pride of family,",
    "Immortal skunks, unaromatically;",
    "Some deaf bats in a cave, a porcupine",
    "Quill-less, a superfine",
    "Flightless eagle, and, after them, a line",
    "Of geese, unnavigating by design;",
    "Dogs in the frozen haloes of their barks,",
    "A hundred porous arks",
    "Aground and lost, where elephants like quarks",
    "Ape mother mules or imitation sharks\u2014",
    "And each of them half-venerated by",
    "A mob, impartially",
    "Scaled, finned, or feathered, all before a dry",
    "Unable mouth, symmetrically awry.",
    "But how shall I, in my brief space, describe",
    "A tomb so vast, a tribe",
    "So desperately existent for a scribe",
    "Knowingly of the fashions\u2019 diatribe,",
    "I who have sought time\u2019s memory afoot,",
    "Grateful for every root",
    "Of trees that fill the garden with their fruit,",
    "Their fragrance and their shade? Even as I do it,",
    "I see myself unnoticed on the stair",
    "That, underneath a clear",
    "Welcome of bells, had promised me a fair",
    "Attentive hearing\u2019s joy, sometime, somewhere."
