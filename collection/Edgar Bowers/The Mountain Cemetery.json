  "text": [
    "With their harsh leaves old rhododendrons fill",
    "The crevices in grave plots\u2019 broken stones.",
    "The bees renew the blossoms they destroy,",
    "While in the burning air the pines rise still,",
    "Commemorating long forgotten biers.",
    "Their roots replace the semblance of these bones.",
    "The weight of cool, of imperceptible dust",
    "That came from nothing and to nothing came",
    "Is light within the earth and on the air.",
    "The change that so renews itself is just.",
    "The enormous, sundry platitude of death",
    "Is for these bones, bees, trees, and leaves the same.",
    "And splayed upon the ground and through the trees",
    "The mountains\u2019 shadow fills and cools the air,",
    "Smoothing the shape of headstones to the earth.",
    "The rhododendrons suffer with the bees",
    "Whose struggles loose ripe petals to the earth,",
    "The heaviest burden it shall ever bear.",
    "Our hard earned knowledge fits us for such sleep.",
    "Although the spring must come, it passes too",
    "To form the burden suffered for what comes.",
    "Whatever we would give our souls to keep",
    "Is merely part of what we call the soul;",
    "What we of time would threaten to undo",
    "All time in its slow scrutiny has done.",
    "For on the grass that starts about the feet",
    "The body\u2019s shadow turns, to shape in time,",
    "Soon grown preponderant with creeping shade,",
    "The final shadow that is turn of earth;",
    "And what seems won paid for as in defeat."
