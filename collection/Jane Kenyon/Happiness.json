    "There\u2019s just no accounting for happiness,",
    "or the way it turns up like a prodigal",
    "who comes back to the dust at your feet",
    "having squandered a fortune far away.",
    "And how can you not forgive?",
    "You make a feast in honor of what",
    "was lost, and take from its place the finest",
    "garment, which you saved for an occasion",
    "you could not imagine, and you weep night and day",
    "to know that you were not abandoned,",
    "that happiness saved its most extreme form",
    "for you alone.",
    "No, happiness is the uncle you never",
    "knew about, who flies a single-engine plane",
    "onto the grassy landing strip, hitchhikes",
    "into town, and inquires at every door",
    "until he finds you asleep midafternoon",
    "as you so often are during the unmerciful",
    "hours of your despair.",
    "It comes to the monk in his cell.",
    "It comes to the woman sweeping the street",
    "with a birch broom, to the child",
    "whose mother has passed out from drink.",
    "It comes to the lover, to the dog chewing",
    "a sock, to the pusher, to the basketmaker,",
    "and to the clerk stacking cans of carrots",
    "in the night.",
    "It even comes to the boulder",
    "in the perpetual shade of pine barrens,",
    "to rain falling on the open sea,",
    "to the wineglass, weary of holding wine."
