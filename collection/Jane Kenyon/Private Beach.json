    "It is always the dispossessed\u2014",
    "someone driving a huge rusted Dodge",
    "that\u2019s burning oil, and must cost",
    "twenty-five dollars to fill.",
    "Today before seven I saw, through",
    "the morning fog, his car leave the road,",
    "turning into the field. It must be",
    "his day off, I thought, or he\u2019s out",
    "of work and drinking, or getting stoned.",
    "Or maybe as much as anything",
    "he wanted to see",
    "where the lane through the hay goes.",
    "It goes to the bluff overlooking",
    "the lake, where we\u2019ve cleared",
    "brush, swept the slippery oak",
    "leaves from the path, and tried to destroy",
    "the poison ivy that runs",
    "over the scrubby, sandy knolls.",
    "Sometimes in the evening I\u2019ll hear",
    "gunshots or firecrackers. Later a car",
    "needing a new muffler backs out",
    "to the road, headlights withdrawing",
    "from the lowest branches of the pines.",
    "Next day I find beer cans, crushed;",
    "sometimes a few fish too small",
    "to bother cleaning and left",
    "on the moss to die; or the leaking",
    "latex trace of outdoor love....",
    "Once I found the canvas sling chairs",
    "broken up and burned.",
    "Whoever laid the fire gathered stones",
    "to contain it, like a boy pursuing",
    "a merit badge, who has a dream of work,",
    "and proper reward for work."
