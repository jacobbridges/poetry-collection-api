    "The others bent their heads and started in.",
    "Confused, I asked my neighbor",
    "to explain\u2014a sturdy, bright-cheeked girl",
    "who brought raw milk to school from her family\u2019s",
    "herd of Holsteins. Ann had a blue bookmark,",
    "and on it Christ revealed his beating heart,",
    "holding the flesh back with His wounded hand.",
    "Ann understood division. . . .",
    "Miss Moran sprang from her monumental desk",
    "and led me roughly through the class",
    "without a word. My shame was radical",
    "as she propelled me past the cloakroom",
    "to the furnace closet, where only the boys",
    "were put, only the older ones at that.",
    "The door swung briskly shut.",
    "The warmth, the gloom, the smell",
    "of sweeping compound clinging to the broom",
    "soothed me. I found a bucket, turned it",
    "upside down, and sat, hugging my knees.",
    "I hummed a theme from Haydn that I knew",
    "from my piano lessons. . . .",
    "and hardened my heart against authority.",
    "And then I heard her steps, her fingers",
    "on the latch. She led me, blinking",
    "and changed, back to the class."
