    "Like primitives we buried the cat",
    "with his bowl. Bare-handed",
    "we scraped sand and gravel",
    "back into the hole. It fell with a hiss",
    "and thud on his side,",
    "on his long red fur, the white feathers",
    "that grew between his toes, and his",
    "long, not to say aquiline, nose.",
    "We stood and brushed each other off.",
    "There are sorrows much keener than these.",
    "Silent the rest of the day, we worked,",
    "ate, stared, and slept. It stormed",
    "all night; now it clears, and a robin",
    "burbles from a dripping bush",
    "like the neighbor who means well",
    "but always says the wrong thing."
