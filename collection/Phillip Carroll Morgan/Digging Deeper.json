    "I.",
    "fooled the squash bugs",
    "by setting young plants",
    "in the center of piles",
    "of old weathered cedar shingles",
    "that i had dumped",
    "one truckload at a time",
    "around the perimeter of the woods",
    "out of sight of the house",
    "yet near enough to garner a hand",
    "of bucketful for kindling",
    "when the woodstove became",
    "december\u2019s focus",
    "the shingle pile had flattened",
    "from firewood attrition and gravity",
    "so only a few layers remained",
    "no wild plants grew up through the shingles",
    "although a couple of hours of sunshine",
    "lit each pile each day",
    "i called it the secret garden",
    "because no one ever walks that way",
    "II.",
    "the middle vegetable garden",
    "and the south garden (Vegetable River)",
    "have provided entertainment and food",
    "first the june-july drought",
    "scorched and stunted growth",
    "even with frequent watering",
    "then came the late july",
    "and august monsoons",
    "with a 65-70/85-90 mix",
    "almost every day",
    "the plants invigorated",
    "the bugs rebirthed",
    "the grasses skyrocketed",
    "from rock-hard drought",
    "to rainforest jungle",
    "i took a gas-powered weedeater",
    "into the Vegetable River delta",
    "yesterday whacked some high weeds",
    "on the periphery of the melon patch",
    "and uncovered two twenty-pound",
    "crimson sweets in another corner",
    "of the patch a crimson sweet was so ripe",
    "that it had cracked itself open",
    "sixty-five days after",
    "sticking the seed in the ground",
    "i was thrilled",
    "after three years",
    "of growing vines and stunted fruit",
    "i had finally grown",
    "big ripe melons",
    "III.",
    "august gardening is by caesar",
    "certainly august",
    "the purple hulls the",
    "yellow-shelled cowpeas",
    "yellow and white okra blossoms",
    "all wash out in the intensity",
    "of <<green>> whelming <<green>>",
    "even on a cool morning or evening",
    "i come in from the search and harvest",
    "having had not the slightest",
    "perception of heat even with",
    "sweat drenching my forehead",
    "double-shirted long-sleeved",
    "against the reborn mosquitoes",
    "and realize only then",
    "how hot my body is",
    "the air is cool",
    "what created the heat?",
    "a perception narrows",
    "that more than heat and humidity",
    "are at play an intensity",
    "a swollen vibration",
    "more than the half-black over-ripe",
    "jalapenos more than the",
    "crisp prongs of okra pod",
    "more than the nutty crunch",
    "of raw cowpeas more than the",
    "fruitful tangle of kentucky wonder and",
    "morning glory smartweed vines",
    "more than white glistening",
    "corn smut blisters",
    "more than the biggest brightest-marked",
    "three-inch grasshoppers and cicadas",
    "that you\u2019ve ever seen",
    "an intensity underlain in",
    "a crush of <<green>> an interplay a",
    "swollen vibration a",
    "chlorophylandering that even",
    "the dogs won\u2019t come near",
    "no snakes no skinks no lizards",
    "too strong for spiders"
