    "His Father lived, in Berkeley Square.",
    "And oh! the Lad was Deathly Proud!",
    "He never shook your Hand or Bowed,",
    "But merely smirked and nodded thus:",
    "How perfectly ridiculous!",
    "Alas! That such Affected Tricks",
    "Should flourish in a Child of Six!",

    "He went good-naturedly and took",
    "A Perfectly Enormous Book",
    "Called",
    "Attendant on His Majesty,",
    "And murmured, as he scanned the list",
    "(To see that no one should be missed),",
    "'There's William Coutts has got the Flu,",
    "And Billy Higgs would never do,",
    "And Guy de Vere is far too young,",

    "And as for Alexander Byng!\u2014. . .",
    "I think I know the kind of thing,",
    "A Churchman, cleanly, nobly born,",
    "Come let us say Godolphin Horne?'",

    "No doubt you're right . . . One cannot tell!'",
    "He took his Gold and Diamond Pen",
    "And Scratched Godolphin out again.",
    "So now Godolphin is the Boy",
    "Who blacks the Boots at the Savoy."
