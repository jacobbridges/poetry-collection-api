    "The nicest child I ever knew",
    "Was Charles Augustus Fortescue.",
    "He never lost his cap, or tore",
    "His stockings or his pinafore:",
    "In eating Bread he made no Crumbs,",
    "He was extremely fond of sums,",
    "To which, however, he preferred",
    "The Parsing of a Latin Word\u2014",
    "He sought, when it was within his power,",
    "For information twice an hour,",
    "And as for finding Mutton-Fat",
    "Unappatising, far from that!",
    "He often, at his Father\u2019s Board,",
    "Would beg them, of his own accord,",
    "To give him, if they did not mind,",
    "The Greasiest Morsels they could find\u2014",
    "His Later Years did not belie",
    "The Promise of his Infancy.",
    "In Public Life he always tried",
    "To take a judgement Broad and Wide;",
    "In Private, none was more than he",
    "Renowned for quiet courtesy.",
    "He rose at once in his Career,",
    "And long before his Fortieth Year",
    "Had wedded Fifi, Only Child",
    "Of Bunyan, First Lord Aberfylde.",
    "He thus became immensely Rich,",
    "And built the Splendid Mansion which",
    "Is called The Cedars, Muswell Hill,",
    "Where he resides in affluence still,",
    "To show what everybody might",
    "Become by SIMPLY DOING RIGHT."
