    "Some years ago you heard me sing",
    "My doubts on Alexander Byng.",
    "His sister Sarah now inspires",
    "My jaded Muse, my failing fires.",
    "Of Sarah Byng the tale is told",
    "How when the child was twelve years old",
    "She could not read or write a line.",
    "Her sister Jane, though barely nine,",
    "Could spout the Catechism through",
    "And parts of Matthew Arnold too,",
    "While little Bill who came between",
    "Was quite unnaturally keen",
    "On 'Athalie', by Jean Racine.",
    "But not so Sarah! Not so Sal!",
    "She was a most uncultured girl",
    "Who didn't care a pinch of snuff",
    "For any literary stuff",
    "And gave the classics all a miss.",
    "Observe the consequence of this!",
    "As she was walking home one day,",
    "Upon the fields across her way",
    "A gate, securely padlocked, stood,",
    "And by its side a piece of wood",
    "On which was painted plain and full,",
    "BEWARE THE VERY FURIOUS BULL",
    "Alas! The young illiterate",
    "Went blindly forward to her fate,",
    "And ignorantly climbed the gate!",
    "Now happily the Bull that day",
    "Was rather in the mood for play",
    "Than goring people through and through",
    "As Bulls so very often do;",
    "He tossed her lightly with his horns",
    "Into a prickly hedge of thorns,",
    "And stood by laughing while she strode",
    "And pushed and struggled to the road.",
    "The lesson was not lost upon",
    "The child, who since has always gone",
    "A long way round to keep away",
    "From signs, whatever they may say,",
    "And leaves a padlocked gate alone.",
    "Moreover she has wisely grown",
    "Confirmed in her instinctive guess",
    "That literature breeds distress."
