    "Every morning since the time changed",
    "I have woken to the dawn chorus",
    "And even before it sounded, I dreamed of it",
    "Loud, unbelievably loud, shameless, raucous",
    "And once I rose and twitched the curtains apart",
    "Expecting the birds to be pressing in fright",
    "Against the pane like passengers",
    "But the garden was empty and it was night",
    "Not a slither of light at the horizon",
    "Still the birds were bawling through the mists",
    "Terrible, invisible",
    "A million small evangelists",
    "How they sing: as if each had pecked up a smoldering coal",
    "Their throats singed and swollen with song",
    "In dissonance as befits the dark world",
    "Where only travelers and the sleepless belong"
