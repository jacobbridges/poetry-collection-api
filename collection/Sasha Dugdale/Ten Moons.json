    "And then came the ten moons",
    "Full in the sun\u2019s glare, and the seraphim,",
    "And it was light all night in the orchards",
    "And on the plains and even in the towns",
    "And mankind rejoiced, because it was now the case",
    "That the wrecking and equivocating could carry on",
    "The pale night long. Mankind rejoiced",
    "And went forth to those places twelve hours of light",
    "Had not made it worth the while to despoil",
    "And gamboled collectively on the cliff tops",
    "And regarded the night-broiling of the sea",
    "Hitherto forbidden, but now opened in festival.",
    "Half the world\u2019s time unpeeled and exposed",
    "So fruit might ripen faster and trees flourish higher",
    "And forced photosynthesis green all the land.",
    "Then night ramblers, night-sun-worshippers,",
    "Night-motorists fanned out and made the most",
    "Of spectral light, which bleached out stars and even",
    "The cozy old moon herself, who had",
    "Once held a sickle broadside to the sun, and now",
    "Was a hollow daytime shadow.",
    "Only a few old believers slept",
    "Hand in hand, shoulder to breast,",
    "As if their lives depended on it, knowing yet",
    "That the morning would bring nothing",
    "Because the day knew no beginning",
    "And had no end."
