    "I",
    "Swing by starwhite bones and",
    "Lights tick in the middle.",
    "Blue and white steel",
    "Black and white",
    "People hurrying along the wall.",
    "\u201dHere you are, bury my dead bones.\u201c",
    "Curve behind the sun again",
    "Towers full of ice. Rich",
    "Glass houses, \u201cHere,",
    "Have a little of my blood,\u201d",
    "Rich people!\u201d",
    "Wheat in towers. Meat on ice.",
    "Cattlecars. Miles of wide-open walls.",
    "Baseball between these sudden tracks.",
    "Yell past the red street\u2014",
    "Have you any water to drink, City?",
    "Rich glass buildings, give us milk!",
    "Give us coffee! Give us rum!",
    "There are huge clouds all over the sky.",
    "River smells of gasoline.",
    "Cars after cars after cars, and then",
    "A little yellow street goes by without a murmur.",
    "There came a man",
    "(\u201dThose are radios, that were his eyes\u201c)",
    "Who offered to sell us his bones.",
    "Swing by starwhite buildings and",
    "Lights come to life with a sound",
    "Of bugs under the dead rib.",
    "Miles of it. Still the same city.",
    "II",
    "Do you know where you are going?",
    "Do you know whom you must meet?",
    "Fortune, perhaps, or good news",
    "Or the doctor, or the ladies",
    "In the long bookstore,",
    "The angry man in the milkbar",
    "The drunkard under the clock.",
    "Fortune, perhaps, or wonder",
    "Or, perhaps, death.",
    "In any case, our tracks",
    "Are aimed at a working horizon.",
    "The buildings, turning twice about the sun,",
    "Settle in their respective positions.",
    "Centered in its own incurable discontent, the City",
    "Consents to be recognized.",
    "III",
    "Then people come out into the light of afternoon,",
    "Covered all over with black powder,",
    "And begin to attack one another with statements",
    "Or to ignore one another with horror.",
    "Customs have not changed.",
    "Young men full of coffee and",
    "Old women with medicine under their skin",
    "Are all approaching death at twenty miles an hour.",
    "Everywhere there is optimism without love",
    "And pessimism without understanding,",
    "They who have new clothes, and smell of haircuts",
    "Cannot agree to be at peace",
    "With their own images, shadowing them in windows",
    "From store to store.",
    "IV",
    "Until the lights come on with a swagger of frauds",
    "And savage ferns,",
    "The brown-eyed daughters of ravens,",
    "Sing in the lucky doors",
    "While night comes down the street like the millennium",
    "Wrapping the houses in dark feathers",
    "Soothing the town with a sign",
    "Healing the strong wings of sunstroke.",
    "Then the wind of an easy river wipes the flies",
    "Off my Kentucky collarbone.",
    "The claws of the treacherous stars",
    "Renegade drums of wood",
    "Endure the heavenward protest.",
    "Their music heaves and hides.",
    "Rain and foam and oil",
    "Make sabbaths for our wounds.",
    "(Come, come, let all come home!)",
    "The summer sighs, and runs.",
    "My broken bird is under the whole town,",
    "My cross is for the gypsies I am leaving",
    "And there are real fountains under the floor.",
    "V",
    "Branches baptize our faces with silver",
    "Where the sweet silent avenue escapes into the hills.",
    "Winds at last possess our empty country",
    "There, there under the moon",
    "In parabolas of milk and iron",
    "The ghosts of historical men",
    "(Figures of sorrow and dust)",
    "Weep along the hills like turpentine.",
    "And seas of flowering tobacco",
    "Surround the drowning sons of Daniel Boone."
