    "At dawn I heard among bird calls",
    "the billions of marching feet in the churn",
    "and squeak of gravel, even tiny feet",
    "still wet from the mother's amniotic fluid,",
    "and very old halting feet, the feet",
    "of the very light and very heavy, all marching",
    "but not together, criss-crossing at every angle",
    "with sincere attempts not to touch, not to bump",
    "into each other, walking in the doors of houses",
    "and out the back door forty years later, finally",
    "knowing that time collapses on a single",
    "plateau where they were all their lives,",
    "knowing that time stops when the heart stops",
    "as they walk off the earth into the night air."
