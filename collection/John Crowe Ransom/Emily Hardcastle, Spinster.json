    "We shall come tomorrow morning, who were not to have her love,",
    "We shall bring no face of envy but a gift of praise and lilies",
    "To the stately ceremonial we are not the heroes of.",
    "Let the sisters now attend her, who are red-eyed, who are wroth;",
    "They were younger, she was finer, for they wearied of the waiting",
    "And they married them to merchants, being unbelievers both.",
    "I was dapper when I dangled in my pepper-and-salt;",
    "We were only local beauties, and we beautifully trusted",
    "If the proud one had to tarry, one would have her by default.",
    "But right across the threshold has her grizzled Baron come;",
    "Let them robe her, Bride and Princess, who\u2019ll go down a leafy archway",
    "And seal her to the Stranger for his castle in the gloom."
