    "Two evils, monstrous either one apart,",
    "Possessed me, and were long and loath at going:",
    "A cry of Absence, Absence, in the heart,",
    "And in the wood the furious winter blowing.",
    "Think not, when fire was bright upon my bricks,",
    "And past the tight boards hardly a wind could enter,",
    "I glowed like them, the simple burning sticks,",
    "Far from my cause, my proper heat and center.",
    "Better to walk forth in the frozen air",
    "And wash my wound in the snows; that would be healing;",
    "Because my heart would throb less painful there,",
    "Being caked with cold, and past the smart of feeling.",
    "And where I walked, the murderous winter blast",
    "Would have this body bowed, these eyeballs streaming,",
    "And though I think this heart\u2019s blood froze not fast",
    "It ran too small to spare one drop for dreaming.",
    "Dear love, these fingers that had known your touch,",
    "And tied our separate forces first together,",
    "Were ten poor idiot fingers not worth much,",
    "Ten frozen parsnips hanging in the weather."
