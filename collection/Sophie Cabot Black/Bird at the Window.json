    "Beyond is a brightness",
    "I am not equal to",
    "Yet what I see",
    "Turns into what I want,",
    "And to bring nothing but this body",
    "To pass through",
    "The one thing between",
    "Myself and what I crave,",
    "Almost done, the world a ruin",
    "Of leaves, winter at the throat,",
    "My song over and over until",
    "So familiar I can do",
    "What I am about to do",
    "While you who rise from the table",
    "And walk from room to room",
    "Will remember only the sound",
    "Of what cast herself through",
    "All that glass, instead of the song",
    "That was sung until finally",
    "You would ask to know more."
