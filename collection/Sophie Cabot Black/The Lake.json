    "Day and night, the lake dreams of sky.",
    "A privacy as old as the mountains",
    "And her up there, stuck among peaks. The whole eye",
    "Fastened on hawk, gatherings of cloud or stars,",
    "So little trespass. An airplane once",
    "Crossed her brow; she searched but could not find",
    "A face. Having lived with such strict beauty",
    "She comes to know how the sun is nothing",
    "But itself and the path it throws; the moon",
    "A riddled stone. If only a hand",
    "Would tremble along her cheek, would disturb. Even the elk",
    "Pass by, drawn to the spill of creeks below\u2014",
    "How she cannot help abundance, even as it leaves",
    "Her, as it sings all the way down the mountain."
