    "How many times I have provided",
    "For your death; the apple turned one way",
    "Then the other, an arrangement made,",
    "The softer ground. To hold your head",
    "As if this mattered, to say what I think",
    "Essential into your ear,",
    "To watch the eye look everywhere to find",
    "What it does not know it looks for.",
    "To fasten you down in the one place",
    "Where no one can say anything more,",
    "Being nothing else but breath leaving,",
    "While the man with the needle stands by",
    "Until the signal of how it is time. To believe",
    "I know what will happen next; to leave the hill",
    "As the body stiffens; to pass each blossom",
    "Of blood in the snow as if I understood",
    "All I was capable of."
