    "All Nashville is a chill. And everywhere",
    "Like desert sand, when the winds blow,",
    "There is each moment sifted through the air,",
    "A powdered blast of January snow.",
    "O! thoughtless Dandelion, to be misled",
    "By a few warm days to leave thy natural bed,",
    "Was folly growth and blooming over soon.",
    "And yet, thou blasted yellow-coated gem,",
    "Full many a heart has but a common boon",
    "With thee, now freezing on thy slender stem.",
    "When the heart has bloomed by the touch of love\u2019s warm breath",
    "Then left and chilling snow is sifted in,",
    "It still may beat but there is blast and death",
    "To all that blooming life that might have been."
