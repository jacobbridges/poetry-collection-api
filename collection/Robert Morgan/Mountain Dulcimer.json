    "Where does such sadness in wood come",
    "from? How could longing live in these",
    "wires? The box looks like the most fragile",
    "coffin tuned for sound. And laid",
    "across the knees of this woman",
    "it looks less like a baby nursed",
    "than some symbolic Piet\u00e0,",
    "and the stretched body on her lap",
    "yields modalities of lament",
    "and blood, yields sacrifice and sliding",
    "chants of grief that dance and dance toward",
    "a new measure, a new threshold,",
    "a new instant and new year which",
    "we always celebrate by",
    "remembering the old and by",
    "recalling the lost and honoring",
    "those no longer here to strike these",
    "strings like secrets of the most",
    "satisfying harmonies, as",
    "voices join in sadness and joy",
    "and tell again what we already",
    "know, have always known but forget,",
    "from way back in the farthest cove,",
    "from highest on the peaks of love."
