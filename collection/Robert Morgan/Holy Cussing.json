    "When the most intense revivals swept",
    "the mountains just a century ago,",
    "participants described the shouts and barks",
    "in unknown tongues, the jerks of those who tried",
    "to climb the walls, the holy dance and laugh.",
    "But strangest are reports of what was called",
    "the holy cuss. Sometimes a man who spoke",
    "in tongues and leapt for joy would break into",
    "an avalanche of cursing that would stun",
    "with brilliance and duration. Those that heard",
    "would say the holy spirit spoke as from",
    "a whirlwind. Words burned on the air like chains",
    "of dynamite. The listeners felt transfigured,",
    "and felt true contact and true presence then,",
    "as if the shock of unfamiliar",
    "and blasphemous profanity broke through",
    "beyond the reach of prayer and song and hallo",
    "to answer heaven's anger with its echo."
