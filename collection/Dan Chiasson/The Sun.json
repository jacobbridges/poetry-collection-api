    "There is one mind in all of us, one soul,",
    "who parches the soil in some nations",
    "but in others hides perpetually behind a veil;",
    "he spills light everywhere, here he spilled",
    "some on my tie, but it dried before dinner ended.",
    "He is in charge of darkness also, also",
    "in charge of crime, in charge of the imagination.",
    "People fucking do so by flicking him",
    "off and on, off and on, with their eyelids",
    "as they ascertain their love's sincerity.",
    "He makes the stars disappear, but he makes",
    "small stars everywhere, on the hoods of cars,",
    "in the ommatea of skyscrapers or in the eyes",
    "of sighing lovers bored with one another.",
    "Onto the surface of the world he stamps",
    "all plants and animals. They are not gods",
    "but it is he who made us worshippers of every",
    "bramble toad, black chive we find.",
    "In Idaho there is a desert cricket that makes",
    "a clock-like tick-tick when he flies, but he",
    "is not a god. The only god is the sun,",
    "our mind, master of all crickets and clocks."
