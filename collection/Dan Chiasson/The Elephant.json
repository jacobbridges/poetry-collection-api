    "How to explain my heroic courtesy? I feel",
    "that my body was inflated by a mischievous boy.",
    "Once I was the size of a falcon, the size of a lion,",
    "once I was not the elephant I find I am.",
    "My pelt sags, and my master scolds me for a botched",
    "trick. I practiced it all night in my tent, so I was",
    "somewhat sleepy. People connect me with sadness",
    "and, often, rationality. Randall Jarrell compared me",
    "to Wallace Stevens, the American poet. I can see it",
    "in the lumbering tercets, but in my mind",
    "I am more like Eliot, a man of Europe, a man",
    "of cultivation. Anyone so ceremonious suffers",
    "breakdowns. I do not like the spectacular experiments",
    "with balance, the high-wire act and cones.",
    "We elephants are images of humility, as when we",
    "undertake our melancholy migrations to die.",
    "Did you know, though, that elephants were taught",
    "to write the Greek alphabet with their hooves?",
    "Worn out by suffering, we lie on our great backs,",
    "tossing grass up to heaven\u2014as a distraction, not a prayer.",
    "That\u2019s not humility you see on our long final journeys:",
    "it\u2019s procrastination. It hurts my heavy body to lie down."
