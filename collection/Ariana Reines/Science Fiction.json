    "Just now I touched my chest",
    "And felt my heart quivering there.",
    "This must be one of the bad times.",
    "I think it is quivering with remorse",
    "And exhaustion. Once I saw a heart",
    "Beating in a documentary. I was a very",
    "Little girl and the sight disgusted me.",
    "Throbbing and not stopping my heart betrays",
    "Me and yet remains sure and true, a thing",
    "Of nature. Earth bleeding",
    "Its guts out on the sea floor exhausts",
    "Me with remorse and shame, and yet I have to trust it",
    "As wealth is proven by how terribly it devastates",
    "Itself, and I am but one symptom among billions of the wealth",
