    "O Lord, my praying hear;",
    "Lord, let my cry come to thine ear.",
    "Hide not thy face away,",
    "But haste, and answer me,",
    "In this my most, most miserable day,",
    "Wherein I pray and cry to thee.",
    "My days as smoke are past;",
    "My bones as flaming fuel waste,",
    "Mown down in me, alas.",
    "With scythe of sharpest pain.",
    "My heart is withered like the wounded grass;",
    "My stomach doth all food disdain.",
    "So lean my woes me leave,",
    "That to my flesh my bones do cleave;",
    "And so I bray and howl,",
    "As use to howl and bray",
    "The lonely pelican and desert owl,",
    "Like whom I languish long the day.",
    "I languish so the day,",
    "The night in watch I waste away;",
    "Right as the sparrow sits,",
    "Bereft of spouse, or son,",
    "Which irked alone with dolor\u2019s deadly fits",
    "To company will not be won.",
    "As day to day succeeds,",
    "So shame on shame to me proceeds",
    "From them that do me hate,",
    "Who of my wrack so boast,",
    "That wishing ill, they wish but my estate,",
    "Yet think they wish of ills the most.",
    "Therefore my bread is clay;",
    "Therefore my tears my wine allay.",
    "For how else should it be,",
    "Sith thou still angry art,",
    "And seem\u2019st for naught to have advanced me,",
    "But me advanced to subvert?",
    "The sun of my life-days",
    "Inclines to west with falling rays,",
    "And I as hay am dried,",
    "While yet in steadfast seat",
    "Eternal thou eternally dost bide,",
    "Thy memory no years can fret.",
    "Oh, then at length arise;",
    "On Zion cast thy mercy\u2019s eyes.",
    "Now is the time that thou",
    "To mercy shouldst incline",
    "Concerning her: O Lord, the time is now",
    "Thyself for mercy didst assign.",
    "Thy servants wait the day",
    "When she, who like a carcass lay",
    "Stretched forth in ruin\u2019s bier,",
    "Shall so arise and live,",
    "The nations all Jehova\u2019s name shall fear,",
    "All kings to thee shall glory give.",
    "Because thou hast anew",
    "Made Zion stand, restored to view",
    "Thy glorious presence there,",
    "Because thou hast, I say,",
    "Beheld our woes and not refused to hear",
    "What wretched we did plaining pray,",
    "This of record shall bide",
    "To this and every age beside.",
    "And they commend thee shall",
    "Whom thou anew shall make,",
    "That from the prospect of thy heav\u2019nly hall",
    "Thy eye of earth survey did take,",
    "Heark\u2019ning to prisoners\u2019 groans,",
    "And setting free condemned ones,",
    "That they, when nations come,",
    "And realms to serve the Lord,",
    "In Zion and in Salem might become",
    "Fit means his honor to record.",
    "But what is this if I",
    "In the mid way should fall and die?",
    "My God, to thee I pray,",
    "Who canst my prayer give.",
    "Turn not to night the noontide of my day,",
    "Since endless thou dost ageless live.",
    "The earth, the heaven stands",
    "Once founded, formed by thy hands:",
    "They perish, thou shalt bide;",
    "They old, as clothes shall wear,",
    "Till changing still, full change shall them betide,",
    "Unclothed of all the clothes they bear.",
    "But thou art one, still one:",
    "Time interest in thee hath none.",
    "Then hope, who godly be,",
    "Or come of godly race:",
    "Endless your bliss, as never ending he,",
    "His presence your unchanged place."
