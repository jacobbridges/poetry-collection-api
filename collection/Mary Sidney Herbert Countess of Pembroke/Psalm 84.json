    "How lovely is thy dwelling,",
    "Great god, to whom all greatness is belonging!",
    "To view thy courts far, far from any telling",
    "My soul doth long and pine with longing",
    "Unto the God that liveth,",
    "The God that all life giveth,",
    "My heart and body both aspire,",
    "Above delight, beyond desire.",
    "Alas, the sparrow knoweth",
    "The house where free and fearless she resideth;",
    "Directly to the nest the swallow goeth,",
    "Where with her sons she safe abideth.",
    "Oh, altars thine, most mighty",
    "In war, yea, most almighty:",
    "Thy altars, Lord, ah, why should I",
    "From altars thine excluded lie?",
    "Oh, happy who remaineth",
    "Thy household-man and still thy praise unfoldeth!",
    "Oh, happy who himself on thee sustaineth,",
    "Who to thy house his journey holdeth!",
    "Me seems I see them going",
    "Where mulberries are growing:",
    "How wells they dig in thirsty plain,",
    "And cisterns make for falling rain.",
    "Me seems I see augmented",
    "Still troop with troop, till all at length discover",
    "Zion, where to their sight is represented",
    "The Lord of hosts, the Zion lover.",
    "O Lord, O God, most mighty",
    "In war, yea, most almighty:",
    "Hear what I beg; hearken, I say,",
    "O Jacob\u2019s God, to what I pray.",
    "Thou art the shield us shieldeth:",
    "Then, Lord, behold the face of thine anointed",
    "One day spent in thy courts more comfort yieldeth",
    "Than thousands otherwise appointed.",
    "I count it clearer pleasure",
    "To spend my age\u2019s treasure",
    "Waiting a porter at thy gates",
    "Than dwell a lord with wicked mates.",
    "Thou art the sun that shineth;",
    "Thou art the buckler, Lord that us defendeth:",
    "Glory and grace Jehovah\u2019s hand assigneth",
    "And good without refusal sendeth",
    "To him who truly treadeth",
    "The path to pureness leadeth.",
    "O Lord of might, thrice blessed he",
    "Whose confidence is built on thee."
