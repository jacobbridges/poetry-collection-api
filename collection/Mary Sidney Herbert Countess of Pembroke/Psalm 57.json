    "Thy mercy, Lord, Lord, now thy mercy show:",
    "On thee I lie;",
    "To thee I fly.",
    "Hide me, hive me, as thine own,",
    "Till these blasts be overblown,",
    "Which now do fiercely blow.",
    "To highest God I will erect my cry,",
    "Who quickly shall",
    "Dispatch this all.",
    "He shall down from heaven send",
    "From disgrace me to defend",
    "His love and verity.",
    "My soul encaged lies with lions\u2019 brood,",
    "Villains whose hands",
    "Are fiery brands,",
    "Teeth more sharp than shaft or spear,",
    "Tongues far better edge do bear",
    "Than swords to shed my blood.",
    "As high as highest heav\u2019n can give thee place,",
    "O Lord, ascend,",
    "And thence extend",
    "With most bright, most glorious show",
    "Over all the earth below,",
    "The sunbeams of thy face.",
    "Me to entangle every way I go",
    "Their trap and net",
    "Is ready set.",
    "Holes they dig but their own holes",
    "Pitfalls make for their own souls:",
    "So, Lord, oh, serve them so.",
    "My heart prepared, prepared is my heart",
    "To spread thy praise",
    "With tuned lays:",
    "Wake my tongue, my lute awake,",
    "Thou my harp the consort make,",
    "Myself will bear a part.",
    "Myself when first the morning shall appear,",
    "With voice and string",
    "So will thee sing:",
    "That this earthly globe, and all",
    "Treading on this earthly ball,",
    "My praising notes shall hear.",
    "For god, my only God, thy gracious love",
    "Is mounted far",
    "Above each star,",
    "Thy unchanged verity",
    "Heav\u2019nly wings do lift as high",
    "As clouds have room to move.",
    "As high as highest heav\u2019n can give thee place,",
    "O Lord, ascend",
    "And thence extend",
    "With most bright, most glorious show",
    "Over all the earth below,",
    "The sunbeams of thy face."
