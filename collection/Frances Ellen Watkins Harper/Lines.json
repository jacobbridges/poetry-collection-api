    "At the Portals of the Future,",
    "Full of madness, guilt and gloom,",
    "Stood the hateful form of Slavery,",
    "Crying, Give, Oh! give me room\u2013",
    "Room to smite the earth with cursing,",
    "Room to scatter, rend and slay,",
    "From the trembling mother\u2019s bosom",
    "Room to tear her child away;",
    "Room to trample on the manhood",
    "Of the country far and wide;",
    "Room to spread o\u2019er every Eden",
    "Slavery\u2019s scorching lava-tide.",
    "Pale and trembling stood the Future,",
    "Quailing \u2018neath his frown of hate,",
    "As he grasped with bloody clutches",
    "The great keys of Doom and Fate.",
    "In his hand he held a banner",
    "All festooned with blood and tears:",
    "\u2018Twas a fearful ensign, woven",
    "With the grief and wrong of years.",
    "On his brow he wore a helmet",
    "Decked with strange and cruel art;",
    "Every jewel was a life-drop",
    "Wrung from some poor broken heart.",
    "Though her cheek was pale and anxious,",
    "Yet, with look and brow sublime,",
    "By the pale and trembling Future",
    "Stood the Crisis of our time.",
    "And from many a throbbing bosom",
    "Came the words in fear and gloom,",
    "Tell us, Oh! thou coming Crisis,",
    "What shall be our country\u2019s doom?",
    "Shall the wings of dark destruction",
    "Brood and hover o\u2019er our land,",
    "Till we trace the steps of ruin",
    "By their blight, from strand to strand?"
