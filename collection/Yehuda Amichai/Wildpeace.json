    "Not the peace of a cease-fire,",
    "not even the vision of the wolf and the lamb,",
    "but rather",
    "as in the heart when the excitement is over",
    "and you can talk only about a great weariness.",
    "I know that I know how to kill,",
    "that makes me an adult.",
    "And my son plays with a toy gun that knows",
    "how to open and close its eyes and say Mama.",
    "A peace",
    "without the big noise of beating swords into ploughshares,",
    "without words, without",
    "the thud of the heavy rubber stamp: let it be",
    "light, floating, like lazy white foam.",
    "A little rest for the wounds\u2014",
    "who speaks of healing?",
    "(And the howl of the orphans is passed from one generation",
    "to the next, as in a relay race:",
    "the baton never falls.)",
    "Let it come",
    "like wildflowers,",
    "suddenly, because the field",
    "must have it: wildpeace."
