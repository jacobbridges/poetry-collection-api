    "SCENE 1",
    "POET: Again like a rebellious nation my heart",
    "Stands and cries: forward, to the battle!",
    "To the battle? Now? What's a battle to an old man",
    "Like me. O barricades of washed-up words,",
    "Stanzas filling books with my heart's murmurs,",
    "My love is lined with lies and sweetened",
    "With the sweetest white sugar. My thoughts are rusty,",
    "My feelings but smoky furniture",
    "And scraps of youthful rage gone by.",
    "All this, piled on the barricades.",
    "But whither my flag, my withering flag?",
    "Spring is in my heart again and winter in my eyes,",
    "Fall in my arms and frost in my toes.",

    "RACHEL: [",
    "] What's wrong with you? The end of what? What",
    "happened? Good God. I have never . . .",
    "JOE: [",
    "] This is the end. Read the newspaper.",
    "RACHEL: Which newspaper? Where?",
    "JOE: There, that ball, that ball of paper. [",
    "] Well",
    "read it!",
    "RACHEL: One moment. You've torn and crumpled it . . . hold on . . . this",
    "is a serious act of archaeological reconstruction.",
    "JOE: Come on, read it out loud!",
    "RACHEL: . . . and frost in my toes.",
    "O desire, O vain rebellion,",
    "What more do I ask? O dark desperation",
    "In a tenebrous valley like a ship of ghosts.",
    "But behold! What is that light on the horizon,",
    "Yonder as if from a distant cave?",
    "My legs fail me, yet my heart",
    "Soaks up hope like a big sponge in the bathtub.",
    "[",
    "] A big sponge in the bathtub!",
    "JOE: Go on. Go on.",
    "RACHEL: [",
    "] Fine, fine, stop rushing me . . . one moment,",
    "one moment . . . it's hard to make out . . . OK:",
    "Three maidens sit in that cave weaving my fate.",
    "Spin-spin on the spindle, no not on the spindle, no.",
    "They crouch over books by lamplight.",
    "The students. How studious!",
    "Till dawn breaks they study and maybe read my poems",
    "of yore.",
    "JOE: Go on!",
    "RACHEL: Slowly I'll sneak through the rustling summer grass",
    "And watch, struck with awe. There is a window",
    "Ancient, arched, and there she sits with her hand stroking",
    "The hair of her . . . head. O, my studious one,",
    "I begged to see you, only to see, not to touch,",
    "Not to sit in your room, only to know your name,",
    "To call your name, O your name, your name and your",

    "I'll peep stealthily . . .",
    "Enough, I can't read anymore.",
    "JOE: Do you know what this means?",
    "RACHEL: I know.",
    "JOE: The end of my glorious dissertation. The end of the literature",
    "department's rising star. I'll remain a teaching assistant forever. I",
    "might as well go back to the army.",
    "RACHEL: I won't let you, I love you.",
    "JOE: So what? I'll sit and start writing on a new subject. Come to me",
    "in four years when I'm done . . .",
    "RACHEL: You're out of your mind.",
    "JOE: . . . only to discover, like Sisyphus, that it was all for naught.",
    "[",
    "] What an idiot! And just yesterday I wrote the",
    "final chapter! [",

    "that will revolutionize the appreciation of D.G. Castleman's poetry.",

    "RACHEL: But Joe, you admire him more than anyone!",
    "JOE: That stupid old man had to open his mouth again like Balaam's",
    "talking ass . . . [",
    "] Here, the concluding",
    "lines of my thesis: \"Rare are the cases in which an eminent poet",
    "stops writing at the height of his success. Like his Biblical",
    "forebear, Ezekiel, he went silent at the age of forty. What monastic",
    "discipline! What intellectual honesty! What peace with reality! A",
    "king who renounces his kingdom at the pinnacle of power, when the",

    "JOE: It's not funny at all. Four years of work down the drain. My",

    "thought that after twenty-three years of silence he'd start spewing",
    "his verse again, yes, exactly twenty-three years . . . You're not",
    "listening. Put down that idiotic poem.",
    "RACHEL: Let me keep reading:",
    "I shall peep, peep, peep and be struck.",
    "Joe, Joe! It's the stalker. Remember I told you about the stalker who",
    "sneaks up to our window from the yard. Once we ambushed him,",
    "but he managed to escape. The police told us that stalkers",
    "typically hang around student apartments. Here, listen to this:",
    "I will see the three caves, I will see the three maidens,",
    "I will see the three fairies who see into my future",
    "And my primordial past. Quiet, I will not move. Here",
    "come the three.",
    "That's me and Heather and Lisa.",
    "O storm of pink thighs that shan't storm",
    "Over me. My ears hear a door close. And footsteps.",
    "Perhaps a groom steps into the summer night?",
    "He walks out satisfied. Perhaps he whistles a tune?",
    "Quickly I will hide my wretched self, starved as I am,",
    "So as not to see the light in his eyes.",
    "That was you, and that's the stalker! It's the stalker!",
    "My eye hurts, a hard stone has scratched my forehead.",
    "It's him! He tried to climb. Listen to this:",
    "Like a vine, I will climb the wall of your home.",
    "Pour out thy wrath upon me. Pour! Pour!",
    "Don't you remember that one night Lisa poured a bucket of water",
    "onto the stalker from the window?!",
    "JOE: Only the throbbing of my heart remains, and my neck",
    "Catches on the clothesline where the small, gentle, wonder-",
    "ful things hang to dry.",
    "RACHEL: We should hang him out to dry.",
    "JOE: O wondrous dripping cave.",
    "RACHEL: Did you hear that, dripping cave!",
    "JOE: The sound of warm running waters",
    "Filling a white tub of foaming bubble bath",
    "Spills happiness into the heart of the sorrowful listener.",
    "Languidly stretching her body",
    "She slowly, indulgently prepares to anoint herself in oils,",
    "And now like a snake she sheds",
    "A final layer of skin: her clinging panties,",
    "A triangular lace fig leaf with three holes.",
    "Home, go home, O poor old man,",
    "Your head is spinning in the white steam of the bathtub",

    "JOE: And as if that weren't enough, wait, just wait! Now that fat",
    "pseudo-critic will also have to open his mouth. You'll see, soon",
    "you'll see his articles, that abominable bastard, that sycophantic",
    "parasite.",
    "RACHEL: Enough, enough.",
    "JOE: Here is what our famed critic will write: \"Who would have",
    "thought, who would have hoped, that once again Castleman, our",
    "poet, would break the space of his silence. Yes, he did it again.",
    "The man of our motherland's fire ignites his own torch, the man",
    "of the people's revival has revived from the grave of his silence,",
    "his poetry again blazing trails through the spiritual landscape",
    "of our country. The sacred and the erotic have met, the light of",
    "a love renewed illuminates the world of values, and in embracing",
    "that world he returns to us. Is there an allegory more wonderful",
    "than this? Thus with the eyes of this renewed vision our poet",
    "shall watch over our lackluster lives.\"",
    "RACHEL: Watch over, watch over, I'm telling you he's just peeping.",
    "CRITIC: Here D.G. Castleman, the man, the artist, scores. He",
    "penetrates our consciousness, breaks a way into our zone, and",
    "he's in! He's in! The addition of a late love experience contributes",
    "to the momentum of this penetrating goal.",
    "JOE: I'm going out of my mind.",
    "CRITIC: These last poems are emblematic of our soul-searching era. A",
    "time of crisis has arrived. With great struggles has our poet",
    "struggled, and he has prevailed.",
    "RACHEL: Joe, Joe, do you still love me?",
    "CRITIC: With a secretive smile masking the lines, his eyes emerge to",
    "strip veil after veil from our lives, until we stand awestruck,",
    "trembling from the powerful experience.",
    "RACHEL: Joe, look at me! Look at me.",
    "CRITIC: These poems are devoid of the nihilism and iconoclasm",
    "toward enshrined national values that characterize the poets of",
    "our time. There is a return to origins and an originality of return.",
    "A return of return, if you will. Thus he soars like an eagle",
    "above the trends of today with the ethos of the past lighting",
    "his way.",
    "RACHEL: Joe, don't pay attention. I love you.",
    "CRITIC: Through the tension of opposition and a burning, yearning",
    "heart, he embraces this land with all her stones and thorns.",
    "JOE: Embraces, embraces.",
    "RACHEL: That's when he fell, when he tried to climb the wall. Lisa told",
    "me that she heard a thump and some rustling, and Heather said",
    "she even heard someone sighing.",
    "CRITIC: These poems occasionally heave sighs of profound pain. Sacred",
    "quiver and profane quiver meet in the quivering quill of his",

    "stairs in the poetry of D.G. Castleman. They possess a powerful",
    "sacred symbol signifying the stairs in his poetry.",

    "To see your thighs like a man watching",
    "Clouds gather in the firmament.",
    "To see the muscles contract and release",
    "Like a game without end",
    "In the fullness of your thighs.",
    "I shall write my love poems all over your skin.",
    "RACHEL: Actually it's nice to write on skin.",
    "JOE: The old goat.",
    "[",
    "]",
    "CRITIC: Here the poet achieves the essence of his expression. He seeks",
    "to carve the message of his life, the vision of his days and",
    "the prophecy of his nights deeply, into Being.",
    "RACHEL: This is so painful. [",
    "] Joe!",
    "JOE: What? What is it?",

    "Whose threshold I dare not cross.",
    "JOE: What about this?",
    "My storm will storm over your storming virginity",
    "In the quivering white zone of your thighs.",
    "Is that symbolic too?",
    "RACHEL: Of course it's symbolic! The white zone is a symbol of his",
    "simple, lonesome life. The storm is the storm of the nation.",
    "JOE: What, an entire nation in her thighs?",
    "RACHEL: Listen to this:",
    "Words, words, but for words I have nothing",

    "Will splatter my lust.",
    "RACHEL: Enough, Joe, we should at least try. Four years of work.",
    "Remember. Is he married?",
    "JOE: Widowed by the first, divorced by the second.",
    "RACHEL: Trust me. Besides, he's old and I know some judo. I'll appear",
    "in a dark skirt and a simple white blouse, innocent as a",
    "schoolgirl singing in the choir. Proper, virginal, parochial. Here",
    "listen:",
    "Frightened she approached like a flower . . .",

    "POET: Ah, should you suddenly appear, should I see you . . . I would",
    "cast my poetry's net, catch you, and have you floundering. Light",
    "suddenly enters the darkness of my apartment, and there she sits,",
    "her hair cascading over her shoulders. That she is real, that she",

    "bathroom, the refrigerator with each person's food stored",
    "separately, and the smell of coffee, and the droves of boys that come",
    "and go as if making honey from a hive. What are their names these",
    "days? And your name and your name and your name.",

    "JOE: It's a lost cause, he's done it all over again.",
    "RACHEL: Help! Please help!",

    "RACHEL: No, no, only in his imagination. It's all symbolic. I simply sit",
    "and listen to him like an innocent student, the teacher's pet.",
    "JOE: It's the teacher's petting that concerns me.",
    "RACHEL: Look, all I do is let him spill his guts and his boring poems",

    "Do you see what I'm saying? Every time he tries to write a line I",
    "pervert him\u2014I mean prevent him. I play with his pen, doodle a",
    "little, and make him laugh. Then he forgets everything.",
    "CRITIC: His renewed poetry of late has been augmented by a",
    "courageous display of blood and wounds, a heightened dimension",
    "of pain. These torments serve as the anchor for his loneliness",
