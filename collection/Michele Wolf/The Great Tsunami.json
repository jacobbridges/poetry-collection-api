    "She recognizes its crest in the way he looks at her.",
    "The wave is as vast as the roiling mass in the Japanese",
    "Print they had paused in front of at the museum,",
    "Capped with ringlets of foam, all surging sinew.",
    "That little village along the shore would be",
    "Totally lost. There is no escaping this.",
    "The wave is flooding his heart,",
    "And he is sending the flood",
    "Her way. It rushes",
    "Over her.",
    "Can you look at one face",
    "For the whole of a life?",
    "Does the moon peer down",
    "At the tides and hunger for home?"
