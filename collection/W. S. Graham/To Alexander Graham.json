    "Lying asleep walking",
    "Last night I met my father",
    "Who seemed pleased to see me.",
    "He wanted to speak. I saw",
    "His mouth saying something",
    "But the dream had no sound.",
    "We were surrounded by",
    "Laid-up paddle steamers",
    "In The Old Quay in Greenock.",
    "I smelt the tar and the ropes.",
    "It seemed that I was standing",
    "Beside the big iron cannon",
    "The tugs used to tie up to",
    "When I was a boy. I turned",
    "To see Dad standing just",
    "Across the causeway under",
    "That one lamp they keep on.",
    "He recognised me immediately.",
    "I could see that. He was",
    "The handsome, same age",
    "With his good brows as when",
    "He would take me on Sundays",
    "Saying we\u2019ll go for a walk.",
    "Dad, what am I doing here?",
    "What is it I am doing now?",
    "Are you proud of me?",
    "Going away, I knew",
    "You wanted to tell me something.",
    "You stopped and almost turned back",
    "To say something. My father,",
    "I try to be the best",
    "In you you give me always.",
    "Lying asleep turning",
    "Round in the quay-lit dark",
    "It was my father standing",
    "As real as life. I smelt",
    "The quay\u2019s tar and the ropes.",
    "I think he wanted to speak.",
    "But the dream had no sound.",
    "I think I must have loved him."
