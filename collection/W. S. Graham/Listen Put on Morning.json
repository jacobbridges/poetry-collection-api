    "A man\u2019s imagining",
    "Suddenly may inherit",
    "The handclapping centuries",
    "Of his one minute on earth.",
    "And hear the virgin juries",
    "Talk with his own breath",
    "To the corner boys of his street.",
    "And hear the Black Maria",
    "Searching the town at night.",
    "And hear the playropes caa",
    "The sister Mary in.",
    "And hear Willie and Davie",
    "Among bracken of Narnain",
    "Sing in a mist heavy",
    "With myrtle and listeners.",
    "And hear the higher town",
    "Weep a petition of fears",
    "At the poorhouse close upon",
    "The public heartbeat.",
    "And hear the children tig",
    "And run with my own feet",
    "Into the netting drag",
    "Of a suiciding principle.",

    "Waken into miracle.",
    "The audience lies awake",
    "Under the tenements",
    "Under the sugar docks",
    "Under the printed moments.",
    "The centuries turn their locks",
    "And open under the hill",
    "Their inherited books and doors",
    "All gathered to distil",
    "Like happy berry pickers",
    "One voice to talk to us.",
    "Yes listen. It carries away",
    "The second and the years",
    "Till the heart\u2019s in a jacket of snow",
    "And the head\u2019s in a helmet white",
    "And the song sleeps to be wakened",
    "By the morning ear bright.",
    "Listen. Put on morning.",
    "Waken into falling light."
