    "O wind, thou hast thy kingdom in the trees,",
    "And all thy royalties",
    "Sweep through the land to-day.",
    "It is mid June,",
    "And thou, with all thy instruments in tune,",
    "Thine orchestra",
    "Of heaving fields and heavy swinging fir,",
    "Strikest a lay",
    "That doth rehearse",
    "Her ancient freedom to the universe.",
    "All other sound in awe",
    "Repeats its law:",
    "The bird is mute; the sea",
    "Sucks up its waves; from rain",
    "The burthened clouds refrain,",
    "To listen to thee in thy leafery,",
    "Thou unconfined,",
    "Lavish, large, soothing, refluent summer wind."
