    "A huge sound waits, bound in the ice,",
    "in the icicle roots, in the buds of snow",
    "on fir branches, in the falling silence",
    "of snow, glittering in the sun, brilliant",
    "as a swarm of gnats, nothing but hovering",
    "wings at midday. With the sun comes noise.",
    "Tongues of ice break free, fall, shatter,",
    "splinter, speak. If I could write the words.",
    "Simple, like turning a page, to say",
    "what happened, but this means a return",
    "to the cold place where I am being punished.",
    "Alone to the stony circle where I am frozen,",
    "the empty space, children, mother, father gone,",
    "lover gone away. There grief still sits",
    "and waits, grim, numb, keeping company with",
    "anger. I can smell my anger like sulfur-",
    "struck matches. I wanted what had happened",
    "to be a wall to burn, a window to smash.",
    "At my fist the pieces would sparkle and fall.",
    "All would be changed. I would not be alone.",
    "Instead I have told my story over and over",
    "at parties, on the edge of meetings, my life",
    "clenched in my fist, my eyes brittle as glass.",
    "Ashamed, people turned their faces away",
    "from the woman ranting, asking:",
    "stretch out your hand. Come down, glittering,",
    "from where you have hidden yourself away."
