    "The Tiger-Woman came to me",
    "When dusk was close and men were dull.",
    "She beckoned from the jungle-path;",
    "I followed, dreaming, fanciful.",
    "The Tiger-Woman\u2019s face is pale,",
    "But oh, her speaking eyes are dark.",
    "No beast can move so lithe as she",
    "Beside the matted river\u2019s mark.",
    "The jungle is a fearsome place",
    "For men who hunt, and men who slay,",
    "But I was not afraid to go",
    "Where Tiger-Woman led the way.",
    "The Tiger-Woman\u2019s lips are thin;",
    "Her teeth are like the Tiger\u2019s teeth.",
    "Yet her soft hands are woman\u2019s hands,",
    "And oh, the blood beats warm beneath.",
    "She led me to a little glade,\u2014",
    "The creepers with the moon inwove,\u2014",
    "And two great striped beasts leaped up",
    "And fawned upon her breast in love.",
    "The Tiger-Woman\u2019s voice was sweet;",
    "I hearkened and was not afraid.",
    "She stroked the Tigers\u2019 fearful jaws;",
    "Upon their heads my hands I laid.",
    "And all the jungle things drew near,",
    "And all the leaves a music made",
    "Like spirits chanting in a choir",
    "Along the bamboo colonnade.",
    "Too sweet for human harps to sound,",
    "It touched my blood, it fired my heart",
    "The Tiger-Woman sang, and I",
    "Sang too, and understood her art.",
    "She kissed the Tiger\u2019s snarling mouth.",
    "She kissed\u2014I marveled that she could\u2014",
    "But now her lips were warm on mine;",
    "I cared not they were dabbed with blood.",
    "What if the traveller shuns my hut,",
    "What if the world forgets to be,",
    "What if I have the Tiger\u2019s heart,\u2014",
    "The Tiger-Woman loveth me!"
