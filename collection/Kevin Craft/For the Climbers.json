    "Among the many lives you\u2019ll never lead,",
    "consider that of the wolverine, for whom avalanche",
    "is opportunity, who makes a festival",
    "of frozen marrow from the femur of an elk,",
    "who wears the crooked North Star like an amulet",
    "of teeth. In the game of which animal",
    "would you return as, today I\u2019m thinking",
    "snowshoe hare, a scuffle in the underbrush,",
    "one giant leap. You never see them",
    "coming and going, only the crosshairs",
    "of their having passed, ascending the ridge, lost",
    "or not lost in succession forests giving way",
    "to open meadow where deep snow",
    "lingers and finally relents, uncovering",
    "acres of lily \u2014 glacier yellow, avalanche",
    "white \u2014 daylight restaking its earthly claim.",
    "Every season swallows someone \u2014",
    "Granite Mountain with its blunderbuss",
    "gullies, Tatoosh a lash on the tongue,",
    "those climbers caught if not unawares",
    "then perfectly hapless, not thinking of riding",
    "that snowstorm to the summit, not thinking",
    "wolverine fever in the shivering blood,",
    "not thinking steelhead cutthroat rainbow",
    "or the languid river that will carry them out."
