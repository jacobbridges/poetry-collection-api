    "Peace fell on the dim lands a sort of abstraction",
    "The metronome counted one petal after another",
    "So the petals fell as or in some music",
    "This song needs no breath just an apparition",
    "With a mouth open and eyes and eyes",
    "The wet smear of eyes beneath pink",
    "Petals in excess of the window frame\u2019s bright",
    "Yellow square and yes spring gathers right now",
    "The moisture from my breath up into clouds",
    "Whose downpour makes of the plum tree in blossom",
    "A diminishing crowd for which the natural symbol",
    "Refuses to exist a plain blue gem on a pin",
    "Faces glowing within the stone like flowers",
    "Within the stone like flaws the mind turns inward",
    "Turns inward its tangle of wet black boughs",
    "A knot pulled tight so tight it ceases to be",
    "A knot yes I\u2019ll say it a knot that becomes angelic",
    "Another example everywhere seen of the angelic",
    "Gears toothless and without cogs a sort of mist",
    "That turns the other gear by drifting through it",
    "As just now through my eye drifts that storm",
    "Battered tree whose broken-petal pocked bark",
    "Asks of me a question my mouth can\u2019t speak",
    "Like a river that dives underground just there",
    "There where the animals thirst the most",
    "A desert fox say or say a toad or let\u2019s speak more simply",
    "About a plum which bursts through its own explosion",
    "Into being and hangs there so ponderously",
    "As if as if not concerned with innocence or",
    "Gravity or other acute angles as they evaporate",
    "Into this poem O no am I speaking again again about",
    "dim lands these dim dim lands of of peace"
