    "A rectangular Bulova, my Zadie",
    "called a dress watch, I wore it for years,",
    "and though it gave the wrong time",
    "I treasured the sense of community",
    "it offered, the beauty of certain numerals \u2014",
    "the seven especially, the way it leaned",
    "into its subtle work and never changed,",
    "and signified exactly what it was",
    "and no more. In dreams I learned",
    "that only the watch and the circle",
    "of ash trees surrounding me, and the grass",
    "prodding my bare feet, and of course",
    "my nakedness were necessary, though",
    "common. Just surrendering my youth,",
    "I still believed everything in dreams",
    "meant something I could parse to discover",
    "who we were.",
    "As I write these words",
    "in sepia across a lined page I have",
    "no idea why they\u2019ve taken the shape",
    "I\u2019ve given them, some cursive, some not,",
    "some elegantly articulated, others plain,",
    "many of no use at all. They go on working",
    "as best they can, like the Parker 51",
    "that spent its coming of age stumbling",
    "backwards into Yiddish or the Bulova",
    "that finally threw up its twin baroque arms",
    "in surrender to the infinite and quit",
    "without a word. The Parker still works",
    "and is never to blame. On good days",
    "it works better than I, and when it leaks",
    "it leaks only ink, never a word best",
    "left unsaid.",
    "As a boy I would steal",
    "into Zadie\u2019s bedroom, find the watch",
    "in a velvet box, wind it, hold it",
    "to each ear \u2014 back then both worked \u2014",
    "to hear its music, the jeweled wheels",
    "and axles that kept time alive.",
    "There is still such joy in these tokens",
    "from back of beyond: the watch,",
    "the Parker pen, the tiny pocket knife",
    "he used to separate truth from lies,",
    "the ivory cigarette holder \u2014",
    "a gift, he claimed, from FDR",
    "who mistook him for a famous",
    "Russian violinist. I could call them",
    "\u201cInfinite riches in a little room\u201d",
    "or go cosmic and regard them",
    "as fragments of a great mystery",
    "instead of what they are,",
    "amulets against nothing."
