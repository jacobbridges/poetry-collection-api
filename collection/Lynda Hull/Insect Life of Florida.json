    "In those days I thought their endless thrum",
    "was the great wheel that turned the days, the nights.",
    "In the throats of hibiscus and oleander",
    "I\u2019d see them clustered yellow, blue, their shells",
    "enameled hard as the sky before the rain.",
    "All that summer, my second, from city",
    "to city my young father drove the black coupe",
    "through humid mornings I\u2019d wake to like fever",
    "parceled between luggage and sample goods.",
    "Afternoons, showers drummed the roof,",
    "my parents silent for hours. Even then I knew",
    "something of love was cruel, was distant.",
    "Mother leaned over the seat to me, the orchid",
    "Father\u2019d pinned in her hair shriveled",
    "to a purple fist. A necklace of shells",
    "coiled her throat, moving a little as she",
    "murmured of alligators that float the rivers",
    "able to swallow a child whole, of mosquitoes",
    "whose bite would make you sleep a thousand years.",
    "And always the trance of blacktop shimmering",
    "through swamps with names like incantations\u2014",
    "Okeefenokee, where Father held my hand",
    "and pointed to an egret\u2019s flight unfolding",
    "white above swamp reeds that sang with insects",
    "until I was lost, until I was part",
    "of the singing, their thousand wings gauze",
    "on my body, tattooing my skin.",
    "Father rocked me later by the water,",
    "the motel balcony, singing calypso",
    "with the Jamaican radio. The lyrics",
    "a net over the sea, its lesson",
    "of desire and repetition. Lizards flashed",
    "over his shoes, over the rail",
    "where the citronella burned merging our",
    "shadows\u2014Father\u2019s face floating over mine",
    "in the black changing sound",
    "of night, the enormous Florida night,",
    "metallic with cicadas, musical",
    "and dangerous as the human heart."
