    "A hole is nothing",
    "but what remains around it.",
    "My brother stood",
    "in the refrigerator light",
    "drinking milk that poured",
    "out of his head",
    "through thick black curls",
    "down his back into a puddle",
    "growing larger around him.",
    "My body stood between the",
    "living room and kitchen",
    "one foot on worn carpet",
    "one on cold linoleum.",
    "He couldn't hear his name",
    "clouding from my mouth",
    "settling in the fluorescent air.",
    "I wanted to put my finger",
    "into the hole",
    "feel the smooth channel",
    "he escaped through",
    "stop the milk",
    "so he could swallow it",
    "but my body held",
    "as if driven into place.",
    "The milk on the floor",
    "reflected the light",
    "then became it.",
    "Floated upward and outward",
    "filling every shadow",
    "blowing the dark open."
