    "As we sat at the feet of the string quartet,",
    "in their living room, on a winter night,",
    "through the hardwood floor spurts and gulps",
    "and tips and shudders came up, and the candle-scent",
    "air was thick-alive with pearwood,",
    "ebony, spruce, poplar, and horse",
    "howled, and cat skreeled, and then,",
    "when the Gr\u00f6sse Fugue was around us, under us,",
    "over us, in us, I felt I was hearing",
    "the genes of my birth-family, pulled, keening",
    "and grieving and scathing, along each other,",
    "scraping and craving, I felt myself held in that",
    "woods of hating longing, and I knew",
    "and knew myself, and my parents, and their parents,",
    "there\u2014and then, at a distance, I sensed,",
    "as if it were thirty years ago,",
    "a being, far off yet, oblique-approaching,",
    "straying toward, and then not toward,",
    "and then toward this place, like a wandering dreaming",
    "herdsman, my husband. And I almost wanted",
    "to warn him away, to call out to him",
    "to go back whence he came, into some calmer life,",
    "but his beauty was too moving to me,",
    "and I wanted too much to not be alone, in the",
    "covert, any more, and so I prayed him",
    "come to me, I bid him hasten, and good welcome."
