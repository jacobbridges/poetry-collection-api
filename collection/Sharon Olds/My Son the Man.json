    "Suddenly his shoulders get a lot wider,",
    "the way Houdini would expand his body",
    "while people were putting him in chains. It seems",
    "no time since I would help him to put on his sleeper,",
    "guide his calves into the gold interior,",
    "zip him up and toss him up and",
    "catch his weight. I cannot imagine him",
    "no longer a child, and I know I must get ready,",
    "get over my fear of men now my son",
    "is going to be one. This was not",
    "what I had in mind when he pressed up through me like a",
    "sealed trunk through the ice of the Hudson,",
    "snapped the padlock, unsnaked the chains,",
    "and appeared in my arms. Now he looks at me",
    "the way Houdini studied a box",
    "to learn the way out, then smiled and let himself be manacled."
