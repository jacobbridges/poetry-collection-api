    "In the back of the charm-box, in a sack, the baby",
    "canines and incisors are mostly chaff,",
    "by now, split kernels and acicular down, no",
    "whole utensils left: half",
    "an adz; half a shovel, in its broken",
    "handle a marrow well of the will",
    "to dig and bite. And the enamel hems",
    "are sharp as shell-tools, and the colors go from",
    "salt, to bone, to pee on snow, to",
    "sun on pond-ice embedded with twigs",
    "and chipped-off skate-blade. One cuspid",
    "is like the tail of an ivory chough",
    "on my grandmother's what-not in a gravure on my mother's",
    "bureau in my father's house in my head,",
    "I think it's our daughter's, but the dime Hermes",
    "mingled the deciduals of our girl and boy, safe-",
    "keeping them together with the note that says",
    "A Bag of Moany. I pore over the shards,",
    "a skeleton-lover\u2014but who could throw out",
    "these short pints of osseus breastmilk,",
    "or the wisdom, with its charnel underside,",
    "and its dome, smooth and experienced,",
    "ground in anger, rinsed in silver",
    "when the mouth waters. From above, its knurls",
    "are a cusp-ring of mountain tops",
    "around an amber crevasse, where in high",
    "summer the summit wildflowers open",
    "for a day\u2014Crown Buttercup, Alpine Flames,",
    "Shooting-Star, Rosy Fairy Lantern,",
    "Cream Sacs, Sugar Scoop."
