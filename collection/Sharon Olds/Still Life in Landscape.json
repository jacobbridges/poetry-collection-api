    "It was night, it had rained, there were pieces of cars and",
    "half-cars strewn, it was still, and bright,",
    "a woman was lying on the highway, on her back,",
    "with her head curled back and tucked under her shoulders",
    "so the back of her head touched her spine",
    "between her shoulder-blades, her clothes",
    "mostly accidented off, and her",
    "leg gone, a long bone",
    "sticking out of the stub of her thigh\u2014",
    "this was her her abandoned matter,",
    "my mother grabbed my head and turned it and",
    "clamped it into her chest, between",
    "her breasts. My father was driving\u2014not sober",
    "but not in this accident, we\u2019d approached it out of",
    "neutral twilight, broken glass",
    "on wet black macadam, like an underlying",
    "midnight abristle with stars. This was",
    "the world\u2014maybe the only one.",
    "The dead woman was not the person",
    "my father had recently almost run over,",
    "who had suddenly leapt away from our family",
    "car, jerking back from death,",
    "she was not I, she was not my mother,",
    "but maybe she was a model of the mortal,",
    "the elements ranged around her on the tar\u2014",
    "glass, bone, metal, flesh, and the family."
