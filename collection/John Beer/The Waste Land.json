    "you had only half been listening until she said,",
    "\u201cIt sounds like nothing else, not like the wind",
    "or ocean, not even like the early Pixies,",

    "getting a letter addressed to someone else",
    "that ends up addressed to you, in that",
    "reading it with a proper sense of shame",
    "throws your devotion to formalities",
    "completely out the window. I think they\u2019re from New York,\u201d",
    "and meant to ask her how the band was spelled,",
    "but the moment had passed, your cigarettes were out,",
    "and the birdless night grew colder. You returned",
    "to people you felt more familiar with,",
    "the oddly Teutonic name in the back of your mind,",
    "and only later came across it in the discount bin",
    "of the Princeton Record Exchange, whose clerks",
    "everyone knows are assholes, so the sneer",
    "on the Tom Verlaine guy\u2019s lips was no surprise,",

    "I told him, Sam, it\u2019s time to take off the puppet head.",
    "You could give him a little credit, though, for standing up",

    "with corporal preservation",
    "recapitulates the ancient",
    "ceremonies of atonement,",
    "or so, at least, it seems to me,",
    "as I lecture empty rooms",
    "on F.H. Bradley and the moon.",
    "Not the moon you lovers see,",
    "the moon as it appears to me",
    "and me alone, my eyes refined",
    "by distillation in the mind.",

    "One wishes one were one, not me.",

    "One quarter struck another. Buskers",
    "danced in supplication of the shadows,",
    "mirroring the disgraced King of Pop.",
    "White noise announced the train. Orpheus wept.",
    "After North and Clybourn comes Division,",
    "and after Division, the final law, whose lord",

    "I will not pretend I know the song he sang",
    "before the dreadful pair. You know the stories",
    "as well as I: that from the gramophone",
    "a swell of scratch and hurl and gem-like glint,",
    "of vouchsafed soul and breakbeats reconciled,",
    "shattered the shale resolve of Death himself:",
    "edict turned to grace. But I can still",
    "remind you of the lesson coming up,",
    "paused as we are at the axis of our hope.",
    "Necessity may, for a moment, yield to love,",
    "but love explodes each moment in its drive",
    "to the next, and the next, and the next, like footsteps\u2014",
    "With a sudden cry Sgt. Wojo averred:",
    "\u201cThe song of policemen has yet to be heard!",
    "You can call it ignoble, or even absurd,",
    "But my comrades have hung on each sibilant word,",
    "And we\u2019ve waited and waited as locations blurred",
    "From subway to Hades: we\u2019ve yet to be heard!\u201d",
    "Amid shouts of sha-hoobla, tik-tak, and tra-lay,",
    "The song of policemen now carried the day.",
    "Brass buttons new polished, bright jackets fresh pressed,",
    "And riot protectors protecting their chests,",

    "They sang as they rounded up each interloper:",
    "Each anti-war chanter, each car window soaper.",

    "That the bravest policeman felt clutch at his heart",
    "From the untamed community begging his art.",
    "\u201cHey-hey-o,\u201d they sang, and such pleasant palaver,",
    "And then morning came. They were walking cadavers.",
    "They might tell funny stories, or wrestle, or shout,",
    "But something\u2014divine spark? the soul?\u2014had gone out.",
    "And all of the people and all of the streets",
    "And all of the sweet shops where young lovers meet",
    "Invisibly withered, and no one could say",
    "Where deadness had come from, how long it might stay.",
    "But now Wojohowicz regrets his decision",
    "To insert himself. There will be no revision.",
    "So he takes off his hat and he gives up his gun",
    "And that\u2019s how the song of the policemen is done.",
    "Where were you then?",
    "I was at North and Clybourn.",
    "No one was with you?",
    "I was alone.",
    "And Death\u2019s dispensation?",
    "It came with conditions.",
    "Conditions you flouted?",
    "I slipped. The underworld does not forgive.",
    "When all aloud the wind is blowing,",
    "And coughing drowns the poet\u2019s song,",
    "And terminals brood softly glowing,",
    "And Marian wears a blue sarong,",
    "When synthecrabs squirm in the beaker,",
    "Then nightly hums the opaque speaker",
    "Tu-who;",
    "Tu-whit, tu-who\u2014a subtle note,",

    "A current under sea",
    "Picked his bones in whispers. And this I know.",
    "Forgot the way of gulls. He rose and fell.",
    "His teeth as white as snow.",
    "A current under sea. O you",
    "Walk her every day into the deep sea swell.",
    "She passed the stages of her age and youth.",
    "Orpheus wept. A big big love.",
    "O you who turn the wheel,",
    "Consider how his bones were picked,",
    "A fortnight dead. And this I know.",
    "Gentile or Phoenician, dark Don Juan,",
    "A big big love. A big big love. As tall as you.",
    "V. DEATH TO POETRY",
    "Orpheus awoke in the poem of disguises, the poem once called \u201cThe Waste Land.\u201d Friends, listen up. He gathered the remnants of the life he had dreamed. He renounced the burden of the name he bore. He began to walk.",
    "Orpheus walked down Milwaukee Avenue toward the Flatiron Building. He passed bodegas, taquerias, vintage stores. He met a hustler with a gas can. He walked past the anarchist kids. And he walked, and he walked, and he walked past the cabdrivers trading insults in Urdu, and he walked past convenience stores, and he walked past Latin Kings, and he walked past waitresses getting off night shifts, and he walked past jazz stars that nobody recognized, he walked past the students, the teachers, the cops. And the sky was the color of eggplant and tire fires, the sky was the field that resisted exhaustion. And he walked, and he walked past the puddles and gutters. And no one walked with him. And SUVs burned, and the asphalt ran liquid and Orpheus saw the dissolving sky and he knew that the name of the poem he had entered could not be \u201cThe Waste Land\u201d or even \u201cWhite Phosphorus,\u201d or \u201cThe Song of Policemen.\u201d In his pocket he fingered a tiny slip of paper. He opened and read it. It said, \u201cThis is the death of the poet.\u201d And yes. And yes. This is the death of the poet.",
    "Shhhh. I am allergic to melodrama.",
    "Shhhh. The serpent encircles the world.",
    "Shhhh. There is plausible explanation.",
    "But watch it! the daughters of Ismara,",
    "Their heaving chests wrapped up in beastly fleece,",
    "From their hilltop perch, catch sight of Orpheus",
    "Smithing his voice to match plucked strings.",
    "Cunctaque tela forent cantu mollita, sed ingens",
    "Clamor et infracto Berecyntia tibia cornu",
    "Typanaque et plausus et Bacchei ululatus",
    "Obstrepuere sono citharae, tum denique saxa",
    "Non exauditi rubuerunt sanguine vatis.",
    "And the stones grew red with the blood of the poet.",
    "These footnotes have I shored against my ruins.",
    "These footnotes",
    "shhhh",
    "we set foot",
    "in a world ash-sick, a bad dream world",
    "no longer the mirror, no longer the poem",
    "the birdless night grew colder",
    "And once the poem ended, commentary began. I said, I, the author, said, \u201cOrpheus is a mask in a poem infected with masks.\u201d I said, \u201cThe importance of footnotes cannot be overestimated.\u201d I said, \u201cThe essential problem of the poem is the essential problem of our time, of all time: how to love one another.\u201d And I was not, readers, Orpheus, and I did not descend into the depths, and I have only these words to defend me, and the shadows, the shadows howl for my blood",
    "Once more in the city he refused to name",
    "a phenomenon that I have often noticed",
    "Once more in the city that endures its fall",
    "Well then Ile fix you. Mackie\u2019s back in town",
    "Once more in the city called Barnes and Noble",
    "an elaborate deception, like a bird",
    "Once more in the city that everyone forgot",
    "and swerved to catch the sun on its wing",
    "cf. McGinty, Possum Among the Hoopoes",
    "a broken face, a city of dust and telescopy",
    "abandoned the ruse that had once been the poem",
    "and listened as the buildings lightly sang:",
    "Oh we\u2019ll meet again",
    "When all the rained out faces",
    "And all the bomb-scarred places",
    "Kiss me kiss me kiss me",
    "Under the telegraphic moon",
    "And I won\u2019t get up, I won\u2019t",
