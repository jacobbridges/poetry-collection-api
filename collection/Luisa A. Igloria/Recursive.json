    "Do not look for illumination.",

    "aperture slashed in a finger-width",
    "of cloth. And yes, I know it is hard to disregard",
    "how tiny and even the stitches are,",
    "how they ring the space",
    "that had to be opened first",
    "to make way for the fastening.",

    "continuous rain. Thoughts sometimes rush",
    "to collect at the bottom of the drain pipe.",
    "Other times they vaporize in the heat,",
    "fall for the voices warbling discontent.",
    "When it rains, I am oddly comforted.",
    "The rain soaks through, asks me to give up",
    "a little of myself. Asks me not to be so hard."
