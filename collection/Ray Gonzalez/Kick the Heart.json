    "Kick in the heart.",
    "Kick the starting lance.",
    "Throw the ground a word and stand back.",
    "The color of terror is the envy",
    "on body rags, the dragonfly war",
    "scraped off a painting inside the door.",
    "Kick the shame.",
    "Kick the falling dawn as fortunate.",
    "Throw the corrupted guest out the door.",
    "A sequence of rhythms bound for",
    "the light on your bed.",
    "On the eggplant cooked for the husband",
    "working late: an ant, a hair\u2014",
    "the only thing said to race the mind.",
    "Take someone else\u2019s voice and touch their ears.",
    "Make sure they hear you cry",
    "in their own whispers, their harangue.",
    "Kick the soil.",
    "Kick the sweet drowning as if you know",
    "the round jubilance of pear is afraid",
    "of a darkening spoon, a honey of flavor,",
    "the tender one who never touches your plate.",
    "The tired one who rations food",
    "to thank God eternity is here and there.",
    "Slip the eye the blue-black stranger,",
    "his instrument of scars and neglect,",
    "its tune of every wish besides",
    "the grave of a careless, quiet man.",
    "Shape his sound into the thumb asking",
    "for a ride in the years of not going anywhere.",
    "Kick the alphabet.",
    "Kick the hungry thigh and try again.",
    "Reduce yourself to a moving mouth, a solemn happiness",
    "that smells of the past, takes hold of the throat",
    "and teaches you to despise omens\u2014",
    "ignore Apache mirrors on rock arches",
    "as if you knew what their scratchings meant.",
    "Kick the heart.",
    "Kick the starting lance.",
    "It moves deeper into the month of blinking neon",
    "where vertigo is perfume, desire foaming",
    "on your bare feet killed by frost,",
    "taken by the animal waking inside your holy cross\u2014",
    "a figure of green gowns and things",
    "that follows you until you dance.",
    "Kick the truth.",
    "Kick the belly until it confesses.",
    "Admit you were fed by a woman",
    "flapping in the wind, told to sit there by a father",
    "who made her give birth to a shimmering head,",
    "your brain of flowers blossoming upon",
    "the body always first to confess.",
    "What snow is left is tired water unmoved by your",
    "seasonal words, your circle healing by slowing down,",
    "swelling to the size of God,",
    "yellow leaves in the blood nothing dangerous\u2014",
    "this impulse, this kick to the brittle lake",
    "where the snow goes away."
