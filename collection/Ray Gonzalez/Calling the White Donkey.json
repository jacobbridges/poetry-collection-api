    "I called the white donkey that hurt my left shoulder",
    "the last time it appeared, ramming me",
    "with its ivory head, cracking my back",
    "to relieve me of worry and hope.",
    "I called the white donkey,",
    "surprised at the sound of my voice.",
    "Scared, I wondered if the white head",
    "would give me its donkey brain,",
    "snowy matter dripping into my ears",
    "like the horse of the first man who fell off,",
    "the donkey teaching me about desire",
    "and the moan, that white hair on the back",
    "of my head that warns me.",
    "I called the donkey.",
    "It came slowly toward me,",
    "huge ears shaking with fury,",
    "its breath turning the air white",
    "as it bit into the white apple",
    "of my throat.",
    "I faced the donkey, watched",
    "its gait become a shuffle of possession,",
    "shaking its head as it stopped to",
    "root its dirty hoofs in the ground.",
    "I stepped back and clicked my fingers,",
    "but it would not come closer, its snort",
    "commanding I listen as it farted.",
    "I walked away and did not know it was",
    "I who yearned for labor of the ass",
    "because the animal I summoned",
    "couldn\u2019t remove the white scar from",
    "my heart, a blind life I lived for good."
