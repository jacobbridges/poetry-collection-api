    "The whiskey stink of rot has settled",
    "in the garden, and a burst of fruit flies rises",
    "when I touch the dying tomato plants.",
    "Still, the claws of tiny yellow blossoms",
    "flail in the air as I pull the vines up by the roots",
    "and toss them in the compost.",
    "It feels cruel. Something in me isn\u2019t ready",
    "to let go of summer so easily. To destroy",
    "what I\u2019ve carefully cultivated all these months.",
    "Those pale flowers might still have time to fruit.",
    "My great-grandmother sang with the girls of her village",
    "as they pulled the flax. Songs so old",
    "and so tied to the season that the very sound",
    "seemed to turn the weather."
