    "Condemned to Hope\u2019s delusive mine,",
    "As on we toil from day to day,",
    "By sudden blasts, or slow decline,",
    "Our social comforts drop away.",
    "Well tried through many a varying year,",
    "See Levet to the grave descend;",
    "Officious, innocent, sincere,",
    "Of every friendless name the friend.",
    "Yet still he fills Affection\u2019s eye,",
    "Obscurely wise, and coarsely kind;",
    "Nor, lettered Arrogance, deny",
    "Thy praise to merit unrefined.",
    "When fainting Nature called for aid,",
    "And hovering Death prepared the blow,",
    "His vigorous remedy displayed",
    "The power of art without the show.",
    "In Misery\u2019s darkest cavern known,",
    "His useful care was ever nigh,",
    "Where hopeless Anguish poured his groan,",
    "And lonely Want retired to die.",
    "No summons mocked by chill delay,",
    "No petty gain disdained by pride,",
    "The modest wants of every day",
    "The toil of every day supplied.",
    "His virtues walked their narrow round,",
    "Nor made a pause, nor left a void;",
    "And sure the Eternal Master found",
    "The single talent well employed.",
    "The busy day, the peaceful night,",
    "Unfelt, uncounted, glided by;",
    "His frame was firm, his powers were bright,",
    "Though now his eightieth year was nigh.",
    "Then with no throbbing fiery pain,",
    "No cold gradations of decay,",
    "Death broke at once the vital chain,",
    "And freed his soul the nearest way."
