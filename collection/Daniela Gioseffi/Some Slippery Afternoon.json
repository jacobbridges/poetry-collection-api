    "A silver watch you've worn for years",
    "is suddenly gone, leaving a pale",
    "white stripe blazing on your wrist.",
    "A calendar, marked with appointments",
    "you\u2019ve meant to keep, disappears, leaving",
    "a faded spot on the wall where it hung.",
    "You search the house, yard, trash cans",
    "for weeks, but never find it.",
    "One night the glass in your windows",
    "vanishes,",
    "leaving you sitting in a gust of wind.",
    "You think how a leg is suddenly lost",
    "beneath a subway train, or taxi\u2019s wheel,",
    "some slippery afternoon.",
    "The child you've raised for years,",
    "combing each lock, tailoring each smile,",
    "each tear, each valuable thought,",
    "suddenly changes to a harlequin,",
    "joins the circus passing in the street,",
    "never to be seen again.",
    "One morning you wash your face,",
    "look into the mirror, find the water",
    "has eroded your features, worn them",
    "smooth as a rock in a brook.",
    "A blank oval peers back at you,",
    "too mouthless to cry out."
