    "They've flown south now",
    "and one Great Egret fishes the pond",
    "as broad-winged hawks begin their migrations,",
    "kenneling on thermal currents of wind",
    "off above yellowing mountains.",
    "Now, snakeweed blooms along the trail choking",
    "white and purple asters. A few bleeding",
    "leaves fall amidst wilting greenery. Poison",
    "Ivy turns red with warning.",
    "My eighty-three-year-old mother still argues",
    "with my father, twelve years dead. Their hatred",
    "reverberates in a back room",
    "of my head, rattling memories of my lonely childhood.",
    "Their loathing for each other",
    "colors all my days with pain. I loved him",
    "because he loved me best, but I look like her,",
    "my face and spirit tear at each other.",
    "Am I the child of hate?",
    "A wounded love sprouts like a weed",
    "from watery depths, uncultivated,",
    "flowers, white and purple, bloom,",
    "even in these days of dying leaves.",
    "Beyond winter,",
    "no one grieves."
