    "i would be eight people and then the difficulties vanish",
    "only as one i contain the complications",
    "in a warm house roofed with the rib-cage of an elephant",
    "i pass my grey mornings re-running the reels",
    "and the images are the same but the emphasis shifts",
    "the actors bow gently to me and i envy them",
    "their repeated parts, their constant presence in that world",
    "i would be eight people each inhabiting the others\u2019 dreams",
    "walking through corridors of glass framed pages",
    "telling each other the final lines of letters",
    "picking fruit in one dream and storing it in another",
    "only as one i contain the complications",
    "and the images are the same, their constant presence in that world",
    "the actors bow gently to me and envy my grey mornings",
    "i would be eight people with the rib-cage of an elephant",
    "picking fruit in a warm house above actors bowing",
    "re-running the reels of my presence in this world",
    "the difficulties vanish and the images are the same",
    "eight people, glass corridors, page lines repeated",
    "inhabiting grey mornings roofed with my complications",
    "only as one walking gently storing my dream"
