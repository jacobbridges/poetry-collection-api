    "magnetic lilacs, like nineteenth-century girls",

    "Banana curls. Purple ribbons tying their waists.",

    "Here's the fallen-in deer stand",
    "and the apple tree among maples making fruit for deer.",
    "Outside the woods, the puff of dust on the road",

    "and told to go at it, go play."
