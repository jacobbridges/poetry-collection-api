    "The beer company",
    "did not hire Blacks or Puerto Ricans,",
    "so my father joined the picket line",
    "at the Schaefer Beer Pavilion, New York World\u2019s Fair,",
    "amid the crowds glaring with canine hostility.",
    "But the cops brandished nightsticks",
    "and handcuffs to protect the beer,",
    "and my father disappeared.",
    "In 1964, I had never tasted beer,",
    "and no one told me about the picket signs",
    "torn in two by the cops of brewery.",
    "I knew what dead was: dead was a cat",
    "overrun with parasites and dumped",
    "in the hallway incinerator.",
    "I knew my father was dead.",
    "I went mute and filmy-eyed, the slow boy",
    "who did not hear the question in school.",
    "I sat studying his framed photograph",
    "like a mirror, my darker face.",
    "Days later, he appeared in the doorway",
    "grinning with his gilded tooth.",
    "Not dead, though I would come to learn",
    "that sometimes Puerto Ricans die",
    "in jail, with bruises no one can explain",
    "swelling their eyes shut.",
    "I would learn too that \u201cboycott\u201d",
    "is not a boy\u2019s haircut,",
    "that I could sketch a picket line",
    "on the blank side of a leaflet.",
    "That day my father returned",
    "from the netherworld",
    "easily as riding the elevator to apartment 14-F,",
    "and the brewery cops could only watch",
    "in drunken disappointment.",
    "I searched my father\u2019s hands",
    "for a sign of the miracle."
