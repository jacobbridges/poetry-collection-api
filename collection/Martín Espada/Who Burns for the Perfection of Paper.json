    "At sixteen, I worked after high school hours",
    "at a printing plant",
    "that manufactured legal pads:",
    "Yellow paper",
    "stacked seven feet high",
    "and leaning",
    "as I slipped cardboard",
    "between the pages,",
    "then brushed red glue",
    "up and down the stack.",
    "No gloves: fingertips required",
    "for the perfection of paper,",
    "smoothing the exact rectangle.",
    "Sluggish by 9 PM, the hands",
    "would slide along suddenly sharp paper,",
    "and gather slits thinner than the crevices",
    "of the skin, hidden.",
    "Then the glue would sting,",
    "hands oozing",
    "till both palms burned",
    "at the punchclock.",
    "Ten years later, in law school,",
    "I knew that every legal pad",
    "was glued with the sting of hidden cuts,",
    "that every open lawbook",
    "was a pair of hands",
    "upturned and burning."
