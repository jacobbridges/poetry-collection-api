    "Love, we were young once, and ran races",
    "over rough ground in our best shiny shoes,",
    "we kicked at stones, we fell over, pulled faces.",
    "Our knees were filthy with our secret places,",
    "with rituals and ranks, with strategy and ruse.",
    "Love, we were young once and ran races",
    "to determine the most rudimentary of graces",
    "such as strength and speed and the ability to bruise.",
    "We kicked at stones, we fell over, pulled faces,",
    "and doing so left no permanent traces",
    "because we fought and fell only to confuse",
    "love. We were young. Once we ran races",
    "in ghettos, in camps, in the dismal spaces",
    "of the imagination reserved for Jews.",
    "We kicked at stones, we fell over, pulled faces",
    "at elastic braces, shoelaces, empty packing cases",
    "as if they were the expressions we could choose.",
    "Love, we were young once, and ran races.",
    "We kicked at stones, we fell over, we pulled faces."
