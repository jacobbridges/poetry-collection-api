    "Could one hear in that wood the gentle click",
    "of the shutter like the breaking of a stick",
    "or the safety catch on its climacteric",

    "Like the four winds. Like a low fart that rips",
    "clean air in two, like urine that drips.",
    "Four squatting footsoldiers of the Apocalypse.",

    "Kiss them lightly, faint breeze in the small leaves,",
    "be the mop on the brow, the sigh that relieves.",
    "Let them dump and move on into the dark plate",
    "of the unexposed future, too little and too late."
