    "The visionary moment comes",
    "just as it is raining , just as bombs",
    "are falling, just as atoms",
    "burst like a sneeze in a city park",
    "and enter the dark",
    "as if it were the waiting ark.",
    "You open your hand and blow",
    "the dust. You pick and throw",
    "the stone. You make the round O",
    "of your mouth perfect as light",
    "and the tree bends and stands upright",
    "in the stolid night."
