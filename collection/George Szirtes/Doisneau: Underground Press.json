    "Were I to fall in love all over again, it would be",
    "with this low ceiling, with the calm faces",
    "of the two men going about their craft,",
    "and with her, now twisting towards them,",
    "beautiful, defiant and free.",
    "Because we forget how beauty was once itself",
    "and nothing else, how it held its stellar",
    "moment in attic and cellar.",
    "Because that is what beauty is, this compact",
    "with time and the silence of concentration",
    "on one subversive operation,",
    "that requires courage and sacrifice",
    "and never comes without a price."
