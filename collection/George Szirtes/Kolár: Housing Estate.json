    "What you cannot see through those windows",
    "beyond the bare hill",
    "is the hand resting on the table,",
    "is the man lying still",
    "on the bed, is the vague gesture",
    "of the young woman in the hallway",
    "as she remembers something that happened yesterday,",
    "is the mouse hesitating under the draining board,",
    "is the twelve year old boy putting on a record",
    "of",
    "that he once saw",
    "his parents waltzing to.",
    "All that you see is the all-but-naked child",
    "on the all-but-naked hill against a naked sky,",
    "as if what you could not see were the question",
    "and she the reply."
