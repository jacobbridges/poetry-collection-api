    "That sail which leans on light,",
    "tired of islands,",
    "a schooner beating up the Caribbean",
    "for home, could be Odysseus,",
    "home-bound on the Aegean;",
    "that father and husband's",
    "longing, under gnarled sour grapes, is",
    "like the adulterer hearing Nausicaa's name",
    "in every gull's outcry.",
    "This brings nobody peace. The ancient war",
    "between obsession and responsibility",
    "will never finish and has been the same",
    "for the sea-wanderer or the one on shore",
    "now wriggling on his sandals to walk home,",
    "since Troy sighed its last flame,",
    "and the blind giant's boulder heaved the trough",
    "from whose groundswell the great hexameters come",
    "to the conclusions of exhausted surf.",
    "The classics can console. But not enough."
