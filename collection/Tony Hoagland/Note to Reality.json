    "Without even knowing it, I have",
    "believed in you for a long time.",
    "When I looked at my blood under a microscope",
    "I could see truth multiplying over and over.",
    "\u2014Not police sirens, nor history books, not stage-three lymphoma",
    "persuaded me",
    "but your honeycombs and beetles; the dry blond fascicles of grass",
    "thrust up above the January snow.",
    "Your postcards of Picasso and Matisse,",
    "from the museum series on European masters.",
    "When my friend died on the way to the hospital",
    "it was not his death that so amazed me",
    "but that the driver of the cab",
    "did not insist upon the fare.",
    "Quotation marks: what should we put inside them?",
    "Shall I say \u201cI\u201d \u201chave been hurt\u201d \u201cby\u201d \u201cyou,\u201d you neglectful monster?",
    "I speak now because experience has shown me",
    "that my mind will never be clear for long.",
    "I am more thick-skinned and male, more selfish, jealous, and afraid",
    "than ever in my life.",
    "\u201cFor my heart is tangled in thy nets;",
    "my soul enmeshed in cataracts of time...\u201d",
    "The breeze so cool today, the sky smeared with bluish grays and whites.",
    "The parade for the slain police officer",
    "goes past the bakery",
    "and the smell of fresh bread",
    "makes the mourners salivate against their will."
