    "Sometimes I wish I were still out",
    "on the back porch, drinking jet fuel",
    "with the boys, getting louder and louder",
    "as the empty cans drop out of our paws",
    "like booster rockets falling back to Earth",
    "and we soar up into the summer stars.",
    "Summer. The big sky river rushes overhead,",
    "bearing asteroids and mist, blind fish",
    "and old space suits with skeletons inside.",
    "On Earth, men celebrate their hairiness,",
    "and it is good, a way of letting life",
    "out of the box, uncapping the bottle",
    "to let the effervescence gush",
    "through the narrow, usually constricted neck.",
    "And now the crickets plug in their appliances",
    "in unison, and then the fireflies flash",
    "dots and dashes in the grass, like punctuation",
    "for the labyrinthine, untrue tales of sex",
    "someone is telling in the dark, though",
    "no one really hears. We gaze into the night",
    "as if remembering the bright unbroken planet",
    "we once came from,",
    "to which we will never",
    "be permitted to return.",
    "We are amazed how hurt we are.",
    "We would give anything for what we have."
