    "Who would have imagined that I would have to go",
    "a million miles away from the place where I was born",
    "to find people who would love me?",
    "And that I would go that distance and that I would find those people?",
    "In the dream JoAnne was showing me how much arm to amputate",
    "if your hand gets trapped in the gears of the machine;",
    "if you acted fast, she said, you could save everything above the wrist.",
    "You want to keep a really sharp blade close by, she said.",
    "Now I raise that hand to scratch one of those nasty little",
    "scabs on the back of my head, and we sit outside and watch",
    "the sun go down, inflamed as an appendicitis",
    "over western Illinois \u2014 which then subsides and cools into a smooth gray sea.",
    "Who knows, this might be the last good night of summer.",

    "And God said,",
    "than one hundred sparrows.",
    "And when I read that, I wept.",
    "And God said,",
    "And I looked at the mini bar",
    "and the bad abstract hotel art on the wall",
    "and the dark TV set watching like a deacon.",
    "And God said,"
