    "Cold wind comes out of the white hills",
    "and rubs itself against the walls of the condominium",
    "with an esophogeal vowel sound,",
    "and a loneliness creeps",
    "into the conversation by the hot tub.",
    "We don\u2019t deserve pleasure",
    "just as we don\u2019t deserve pain,",
    "but it\u2019s pure sorcery the way the feathers of warm mist",
    "keep rising from the surface of the water",
    "to wrap themselves around a sculpted",
    "clavicle or wrist.",
    "It\u2019s not just that we are on",
    "the eighth story of the world",
    "looking out through glass and steel",
    "with a clarity of vision",
    "in which imported coffee and",
    "a knowledge of French painting",
    "are combined,",
    "but that we are atop a pyramid",
    "of all the facts that make this possible:",
    "the furnace that heats the water,",
    "the truck that hauled the fuel,",
    "the artery of highway",
    "blasted through the mountains,",
    "the heart attack of the previous owner,",
    "the history of Western medicine",
    "that failed to save him,",
    "the successful development of tourism,",
    "the snow white lotions that counteract the chemistry",
    "of chlorine upon skin\u2014our skin.",
    "Down inside history\u2019s body,",
    "the slaves are still singing in the dark;",
    "the roads continue to be built;",
    "the wind blows and the building grips itself",
    "in anticipation of the next strong gust.",
    "So an enormous act of forgetting is required",
    "simply to kiss someone",
    "or to open your mouth",
    "for the fork of high-calorie pat\u00e9",
    "someone is raising to your lips,",
    "which, considering the price,",
    "it would be a sin",
    "not to enjoy."
