    "For years my heart inquired of me",
    "Where Jamshid's sacred cup might be,",
    "And what was in its own possession",
    "It asked from strangers, constantly;",
    "Begging the pearl that's slipped its shell",
    "From lost souls wandering by the sea.",
    "Last night I took my troubles to",
    "The Magian sage whose keen eyes see",
    "A hundred answers in the wine",
    "Whose cup he, laughing, showed to me.",
    "I questioned him, \"When was this cup",
    "That shows the world's reality",
    "Handed to you?\" He said, \"The day",
    "Heaven's vault of lapis lazuli",
    "Was raised, and marvelous things took place",
    "By Intellect's divine decree,",
    "And Moses' miracles were made",
    "And Sameri's apostasy.\"",
    "He added then, \"That friend they hanged",
    "High on the looming gallows tree\u2014",
    "His sin was that he spoke of things",
    "Which should be pondered secretly,",
    "The page of truth his heart enclosed",
    "Was annotated publicly.",
    "But if the Holy Ghost once more",
    "Should lend his aid to us we'd see",
    "Others perform what Jesus did\u2014",
    "Since in his heartsick anguish he",
    "Was unaware that God was there",
    "And called His name out ceaselessly.\"",
    "I asked him next, \"And beauties' curls",
    "That tumble down so sinuously,",
    "What is their meaning? Whence do they come?\"",
    "\"Hafez,\" the sage replied to me,",
    "\"It's your distracted, lovelorn heart",
    "That asks these questions constantly.\""
