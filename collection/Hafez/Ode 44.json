    "Last night, as half asleep I dreaming lay,",
    "Half naked came she in her little shift,",
    "With tilted glass, and verses on her lips;",
    "Narcissus-eyes all shining for the fray,",
    "Filled full of frolic to her wine-red lips,",
    "Warm as a dewy rose, sudden she slips",
    "Into my bed \u2013 just in her little shift.",
    "Said she, half naked, half asleep, half heard,",
    "With a soft sigh betwixt each lazy word,",
    "\u2018Oh my old lover, do you sleep or wake!\u2019",
    "And instant I sat upright for her sake,",
    "And drank whatever wine she poured for me \u2013",
    "Wine of the tavern, or vintage it might be",
    "Of Heaven\u2019s own vine: he surely were a churl",
    "Who refused wine poured out by such a girl,",
    "A double traitor he to wine and love.",
    "Go to, thou puritan! the gods above",
    "Ordained this wine for us, but not for thee;",
    "Drunkards we are by a divine decree,",
    "Yea, by the special privilege of heaven",
    "Foredoomed to drink and foreordained forgiven.",
    "Ah! HAFIZ, you are not the only man",
    "Who promised penitence and broke down after;",
    "For who can keep so hard a promise, man,",
    "With wine and woman brimming o\u2019er with laughter!",
    "O knotted locks, filled like a flower with scent,",
    "How have you ravished this poor penitent!"
