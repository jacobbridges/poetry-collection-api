    "The merry World did on a day",
    "With his train-bands and mates agree",
    "To meet together where I lay,",
    "And all in sport to jeer at me.",
    "First Beauty crept into a rose,",
    "Which when I pluck'd not, \"Sir,\" said she,",
    "\"Tell me, I pray, whose hands are those?\"",
    "But Thou shalt answer, Lord, for me.",
    "Then Money came, and chinking still,",
    "\"What tune is this, poor man?\" said he;",
    "\"I heard in music you had skill:\"",
    "But Thou shalt answer, Lord, for me.",
    "Then came brave Glory puffing by",
    "In silks that whistled, who but he?",
    "He scarce allow'd me half an eye:",
    "But Thou shalt answer, Lord, for me.",
    "Then came quick Wit and Conversation,",
    "And he would needs a comfort be,",
    "And, to be short, make an oration:",
    "But Thou shalt answer, Lord, for me.",
    "Yet when the hour of Thy design",
    "To answer these fine things shall come,",
    "Speak not at large, say, I am Thine;",
    "And then they have their answer home."
