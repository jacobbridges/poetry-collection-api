    "The fleet astronomer can bore",
    "And thread the spheres with his quick-piercing mind:",
    "He views their stations, walks from door to door,",
    "Surveys, as if he had designed",
    "To make a purchase there; he sees their dances,",
    "And knoweth long before",
    "Both their full-eyes asp\u00e8cts, and secret glances.",
    "The nimble diver with his side",
    "Cuts through the working waves, that he may fetch",
    "His dearly-earn\u00e8d pearl, which God did hide",
    "On purpose from the venturous wretch;",
    "That he might save his life, and also hers",
    "Who with excessive pride",
    "Her own destruction and his danger wears.",
    "The subtle chymic can divest",
    "And strip the creature naked, till he find",
    "The callow principles within their nest:",
    "There he imparts to them his mind,",
    "Admitted to their bed-chamber, before",
    "They appear trim and dressed",
    "To ordinary suitors at the door.",
    "What hath not man sought out and found,",
    "But his dear God? who yet his glorious law",
    "Embosoms in us, mellowing the ground",
    "With showers and frosts, with love and awe,",
    "So that we need not say, \u201cWhere\u2019s this command?\u201d",
    "Poor man, thou searchest round",
    "To find out death, but missest life at hand."
