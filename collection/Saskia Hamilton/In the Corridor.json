    "I passed through, I should have paused,",
    "there were a hundred doors. One opened.",
    "In there, someone whose name",
    "is not yet known to me lived out",
    "his middle years in simple terms, two chairs,",
    "one place laid for early breakfast, one plate",
    "with dry toast and butter softening. There",
    "his mind raced through writings",
    "he had memorized long ago while he tried",
    "to get hold of himself. Once",
    "in his youth he had studied with love",
    "in the corners of old paintings",
    "matrices of fields and towns,",
    "passages intricate and particular, wheat,",
    "columns, figures and ground,",
    "classically proportioned",
    "in lines that were meant",
    "to meet, eventually,",
    "at vanishing point. They continued,",
    "nevertheless; they troubled the eye.",
    "He collected sets of books printed",
    "in the nineteenth century, unyielding",
    "pages, memoirs of the poets,",
    "engravings of rurified private subjects",
    "in times of public sector unhappiness,",
    "frescoes of human oddity in gatefold printing.",
    "Why does it continue",
    "to chasten me, he says to no one.",
    "It does. It is a painful mistaking,",
    "this setting something down,",
    "saying aloud, \u201cit is nothing yet\u201d",
    "when he\u2019d meant, not anything\u2014",
    "but then nothing peered",
    "through the keyhole, nothing",
    "took possession. Snow on the roofs,",
    "snow in traces on the ground,",
    "passersby with wet trouser-cuffs",
    "looking to the pavement as the hill rises,",
    "light gathering in the river",
    "and gradually spreading."
