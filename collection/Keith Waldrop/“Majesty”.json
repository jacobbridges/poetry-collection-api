    "Among other economies, I\u2019m of two",
    "minds, one possessed, the other",
    "a deep peace. Violent trembling",
    "seizes me, launched in the interval.",
    "Enemy of children, of quaint little",

    "of comic papers and caricatures, of",
    "water-drinking. Too short for tragedy.",
    "Rarely has a large or distant expedition",
    "ever succeeded in its object, as may be",
    "seen in the failure of foreign missions, of",
    "human development, the immediate phenomena.",
    "Sympathy for the victors, who gallantly",
    "perish. Collateral catastrophes, as if they",
    "had a will. The more distinctive visual images",
    "sail too long, relinquish, burst.",
    "The \u201cinner voice\u201d is playing a game. Eagerness",
    "and obstinacy. A mysterious invisible",
    "placed in the mouth. We know too well how",
    "terrible it is to contend against personality.",
    "The whole idyll vanishes. Southward along",
    "a coastline, down among cities. Across the",
    "gulf to the promontory. Probably",
    "astonished. Not without mistrust.",
    "You are now my prisoner. Physically I am",
    "myself. Cultivated living, good manners, rich",
    "food and drink, order and elegance in",
    "my house. Erect military bearing."
