    "I",
    "Fate is cleverer than the king",
    "of Babylon. Shadow of yew",
    "fall through windows onto",
    "the floor of the nave and",
    "touch the pillars with tattered",
    "shade. You claim the dearest wish of your",
    "life is to sink into a soul-freezing",
    "situation of horror. The music of a crash",
    "caught in the hollow of a wooded hillside.",
    "2",
    "Grave, questioning sweep\u2014chiefly the weird",
    "that arouses our keenest hopes. The garden of",
    "dreams contains a summerhouse, hazy",
    "period of my growth. There are bodies,",
    "not greatly extended, called seas nevertheless,",
    "because of their depth and",
    "violence. I\u2019ve some little",
    "doubt about this ceremony entirely",
    "embedded in a cup of grassy hills.",
    "3",
    "Pardon me for loitering. I was sleeping",
    "soundly when I was roused by the loud",
    "clang of what turned out to be",
    "a large brass candlestick, flung",
    "against the banister. Unprotected,",
    "destitute of the means of self-defense, you",
    "hug to yourself the consciousness of",
    "vanished beauty. The sea is un-",
    "certain, on the main and also along the coast.",
    "4",
    "Strange rooms. Through these experimental",
    "years, who can describe beauty",
    "in the dead of night? Complain of",
    "frivolity or of portraits exactly",
    "like ghosts. The waters of the great",
    "surrounding sea will completely",
    "evaporate when the sun opens the fifth",
    "of its seven eyes. Oh yes, I take",
    "pleasure in backgrounds, bringing them forward.",
    "5",
    "These are only a few of many",
    "legendary details, called from the distant",
    "future where each thing has its",
    "end, including sea, sun, the eyes.",
    "You live in another season\u2014even now I",
    "feel acrobatic instincts. Large strange",
    "rooms. A silver cup from his household",
    "plate, a sky of the same",
    "gray tones, a great wilderness of books.",
    "6",
    "When the sea subsides into utter",
    "calm, changing clouds caught in its",
    "clarity, then fishermen say the sea",
    "is thinking about itself. A dark back",
    "room, looking down upon a narrow",
    "courtyard\u2014waking out of some",
    "dreams of specters, bellowing the most",
    "frightful shrieks, forgetting only",
    "at the sound of somebody\u2019s voice.",

    "You light me to bed with your light, and",
    "never a night but I am",
    "prey to ghostly visions\u2014a tenderness",
    "no usual in my family. The lion",
    "pauses a certain space of time, amid",
    "a sea of divers thoughts, choppy half",
    "desires, memoranda of search",
    "and hunger, very peculiar",
    "ideas of the world."
