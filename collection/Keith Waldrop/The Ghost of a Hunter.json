    "He reads:",
    "Deep within, in a region hardly accessible, a bold self-image",
    "sends messages of bloodshed and conquest, which reverberate in",
    "his heart of hearts.",
    "[I forget which hand is writing.]",
    "He does not doubt that he exists.",
    "The five senses have left their mark on him. It is a record of",
    "what has happened to him, but he cannot talk or travel until he",
    "finds a body of water.",
    "A man who has lived on reindeer\u2019s flesh amuses himself with",
    "ripples.",
    "In this cage was once a nightingale. In the echo, new words",
    "for wind.",
    "The usual convulsions,",
    "And, after all, months",
    "or years are nothing to him.",
    "[My image contains his body.]",
    "His body contains bodies.",
    "Blemishes.",
    "Inglories.",
    "Vague figures, in a howling wind, and with no notion of",
    "perspective.",
    "Of countless ruined worlds, he would appropriate the",
    "essential emblem. Wall struggling with wall, shadow with shad-",
    "ow.",
    "Thousands of miles a day.",
    "He gazes across an unguarded cemetery\u2014gazes idly, waiting",
    "for new equipment.",
    "As through a fixed window, he finds a kind of space, the",
    "visible world foreshortened.",
    "He does not see deeply, but\u2014still\u2014one thing behind another.",
    "He keeps a tiny bird, folded like a sheet of paper.",
    "Twice two is four\u2014still\u2014and a circle has no angles.",
    "Body sheds shoulder, jaw.",
    "[There are no dead. Only names.]",
    "Too close, ruin wrinkles the surface\u2014his breath bothers",
    "reality. The sun pours down. The pots are mended.",
    "An unfolding, from where it is all contained.",
    "The ships have been salvaged. [I do not know what body he",
    "has in mind.] Clothing is resumed. Temples are rebuilt.",

    "\u201cVerily!\u201d",
