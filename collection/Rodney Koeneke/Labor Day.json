    "So I say to my friend at the day job",
    "\u201cWe are bored sometimes, and scented like realtors",
    "but if everyone\u2019s equally disconsolate",
    "under labor\u2019s gooey caul",
    "then nuance can be stitched more vividly",
    "to secrets lodged inside of everyone",
    "until it becomes your own country",
    "with highways that carry you silently past the jetty",
    "which, from their heavy drinking, the case managers come out to",
    "failing to be stable and badly attempting to sing\u201d",
    "We\u2019re pushing our barques past the mansions",
    "as I say this, near the dwellings of persons",
    "whose lives have no mooring",
    "outside the slow fact of our passing\u2014",
    "huddled arrogantly under their air-conditioning",
    "they want us to be users",
    "moved by advertisers",
    "enticing the constituency",
    "to join them and sit there and weep",
    "But we\u2019re too busy pulling",
    "toward centers where workers assemble.",
    "While time for them is a melody",
    "played at long intervals across condominiums",
    "we who are the power",
    "know our systems so much better",
    "now come to this hour outside it",
    "now give it new form on guitar"
