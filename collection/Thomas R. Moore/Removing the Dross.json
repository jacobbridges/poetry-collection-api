    "After snowstorms my father",
    "shoveled the driveway where it lay",
    "open to a sweep of wind across",
    "a neighbor\u2019s field, where the snow",
    "drifted half way down to the paved",
    "road, before snow-blowers, before",
    "pick-ups cruised the streets with",
    "THE BOSS lettered on red plows.",
    "He heated the flat shovel",
    "in the woodstove till the blade",
    "steamed, like Vulcan at his furnace",
    "removing the dross, then rubbed",
    "a hissing candle on the steel",
    "so the snow would slide unchecked",
    "as he made each toss. He marked",
    "blocks with the waxed blade, lifted",
    "and tossed, lifted and tossed again,",
    "squaring off against the snow."
