    "thus my mother on a postcard",
    "from a walking holiday on the banks of the Saale,",
    "she was spending a week at the spa of Kosen;",
    "long forgotten now, the ancestor no more,",
    "her script a subject for graphology,",
    "years of becoming, years of illusion,",
    "only those words I\u2019ll never forget.",
    "It wasn\u2019t a great picture, no class,",
    "there was not enough blossom",
    "to justify lovely, poor paper, no pulp-free mass,",
    "also the hills weren\u2019t green with vineyards,",
    "but she was from back-country hovels,",
    "so the valleys probably did strike her as lovely,",
    "she didn\u2019t need laid paper or four-color print,",
    "she supposed others would see what she had seen.",
    "It was something said at a venture,",
    "an exaltation had prompted it,",
    "the landscape had moved her,",
    "so she asked the waiter for a postcard,",
    "and yet\u2014",
    "as will we all, including even those\u2014",
    "years of becoming, years of illusion\u2014",
    "who see the town in the valley today."
