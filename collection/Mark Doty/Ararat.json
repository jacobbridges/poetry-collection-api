    "Wrapped in gold foil, in the search",
    "and shouting of Easter Sunday,",
    "it was the ball of the princess,",
    "it was Pharoah\u2019s body",
    "sleeping in its golden case.",
    "At the foot of the picket fence,",
    "in grass lank with the morning rain,",
    "it was a Sunday school prize,",
    "silver for second place, gold",
    "for the triumphant little dome",
    "of Ararat, and my sister",
    "took me by the hand and led me",
    "out onto the wide, wet lawn",
    "and showed me to bend into the thick nests",
    "of grass, into the darkest green.",
    "Later I had to give it back,",
    "in exchange for a prize,",
    "though I would rather have kept the egg.",
    "What might have coiled inside it?",
    "Crocuses tight on their clock-springs,",
    "a bird who\u2019d sing himself into an angel",
    "in the highest reaches of the garden,",
    "the morning\u2019s flaming arrow?",
    "Any small thing can save you.",
    "Because the golden egg gleamed",
    "in my basket once, though my childhood",
    "became an immense sheet of darkening water",
    "I was Noah, and I was his ark,",
    "and there were two of every animal inside me."
