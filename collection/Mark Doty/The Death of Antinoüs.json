    "When the beautiful young man drowned\u2014",
    "accidentally, swimming at dawn",
    "in a current too swift for him,",
    "or obedient to some cult",
    "of total immersion that promised",
    "the bather would come up divine,",
    "mortality rinsed from him\u2014",
    "Hadrian placed his image everywhere,",
    "a marble Antino\u00fcs staring across",
    "the public squares where a few dogs",
    "always scuffled, planted",
    "in every squalid little crossroads",
    "at the furthest corners of the Empire.",
    "What do we want in any body",
    "but the world? And if the lover\u2019s",
    "inimitable form was nowhere,",
    "then he would find it everywhere,",
    "though the boy became simply more dead",
    "as the sculptors embodied him.",
    "Wherever Hadrian might travel,",
    "the beloved figure would be there",
    "first: the turn of his shoulders,",
    "the exact marble nipples,",
    "the drowned face not really lost",
    "to the Nile\u2014which has no appetite,",
    "merely takes in anything",
    "without judgment or expectation\u2014",
    "but lost into its own multiplication,",
    "an artifice rubbed with oils and acid",
    "so that the skin might shine.",
    "Here is his hair, here his hair",
    "again. Here the chiseled liquid waist",
    "I hold because I cannot hold it.",
    "If only one of you, he might have said",
    "to any of the thousand marble boys anywhere,",
    ". Or the statues might have been enough,",
    "the drowned boy blurred as much by memory",
    "as by water, molded toward an essential,",
    "remote ideal. Longing, of course,",
    "become its own object, the way",
    "that desire can make anything into a god."
