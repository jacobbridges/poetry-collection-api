    "Grateful for their tour",
    "of the pharmacy,",
    "the first-grade class",
    "has drawn these pictures,",
    "each self-portrait taped",
    "to the window-glass,",
    "faces wide to the street,",
    "round and available,",
    "with parallel lines for hair.",
    "I like this one best: Brian,",
    "whose attenuated name",
    "fills a quarter of the frame,",
    "stretched beside impossible",
    "legs descending from the ball",
    "of his torso, two long arms",
    "springing from that same",
    "central sphere. He breathes here,",
    "on his page. It isn\u2019t craft",
    "that makes this figure come alive;",
    "Brian draws just balls and lines,",
    "in wobbly crayon strokes.",
    "Why do some marks",
    "seem to thrill with life,",
    "possess a portion",
    "of the nervous energy",
    "in their maker\u2019s hand?",
    "That big curve of a smile",
    "reaches nearly to the rim",
    "of his face; he holds",
    "a towering ice cream,",
    "brown spheres teetering",
    "on their cone,",
    "a soda fountain gift",
    "half the length of him",
    "\u2014as if it were the flag",
    "of his own country held high",
    "by the unadorned black line",
    "of his arm. Such naked support",
    "for so much delight! Artless boy,",
    "he\u2019s found a system of beauty:",
    "he shows us pleasure",
    "and what pleasure resists.",
    "The ice cream is delicious.",
    "He\u2019s frail beside his relentless standard."
