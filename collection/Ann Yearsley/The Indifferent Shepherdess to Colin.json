    "Colin, why this mistake?",
    "Why plead thy foolish love?",
    "My heart shall sooner break",
    "Than I a minion prove;",
    "Nor care I half a rush,",
    "No snare I spread for thee:",
    "Go home, my friend, and blush",
    "For love and liberty.",
    "Remembrance is my own \u2014",
    "Dominion bright and clear,",
    "Truth there was ever known",
    "To combat every care:",
    "One image there impressed",
    "Through life shall ever be",
    "Whilst my innocuous breast",
    "Owns love of liberty.",
    "I ever taught thee how",
    "To prize the soul entire,",
    "When on the mountain\u2019s brow",
    "I turned my rural lyre:",
    "Thou servile art and vain,",
    "Thy love unworthy me!",
    "Away! nor hear my strain,",
    "Of love or liberty.",
    "What arts need I display",
    "To woo a soul like thine?",
    "Thou ne\u2019re canst know the way",
    "My memory to confine;",
    "For my eternal plan",
    "Is to be calm and free.",
    "Estranged from tyrant man",
    "I\u2019ll keep my liberty.",
    "Yon woods their foliage wear,",
    "Be thou away or nigh;",
    "The warblers of the year",
    "Instruct me not to sigh:",
    "My tears ne\u2019er roll the steep,",
    "Nor swell the restless sea,",
    "Except for those who sleep",
    "Bereft of liberty.",
    "Slave to commanding eyes!",
    "Those eyes thou wouldst commend",
    "My judgment must despise \u2014",
    "My pity is thy friend:",
    "If eyes alone can move",
    "A swain so dull as thee,",
    "They mean but to reprove",
    "Thy loss of liberty.",
    "I stray o\u2019er rocks and fields",
    "Where native beauties shine:",
    "All fettered fancy yields",
    "Be, Colin, ever thine.",
    "Complain no more! but rove \u2014",
    "My cheek from crimson free,",
    "Within my native grove",
    "I\u2019ll guard my liberty."
