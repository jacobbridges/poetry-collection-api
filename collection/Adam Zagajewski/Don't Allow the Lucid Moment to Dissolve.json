    "Don't allow the lucid moment to dissolve",
    "Let the radiant thought last in stillness",
    "though the page is almost filled and the flame flickers",
    "We haven't risen yet to the level of ourselves",
    "Knowledge grows slowly like a wisdom tooth",
    "The stature of a man is still notched",
    "high up on a white door",
    "From far off, the joyful voice of a trumpet",
    "and of a song rolled up like a cat",
    "What passes doesn't fall into a void",
    "A stoker is still feeding coal into the fire",
    "Don't allow the lucid moment to dissolve",
    "On a hard dry substance",
    "you have to engrave the truth"
