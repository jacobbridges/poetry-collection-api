    "To go to Lvov. Which station",
    "for Lvov, if not in a dream, at dawn, when dew",
    "gleams on a suitcase, when express",
    "trains and bullet trains are being born. To leave",
    "in haste for Lvov, night or day, in September",
    "or in March. But only if Lvov exists,",
    "if it is to be found within the frontiers and not just",
    "in my new passport, if lances of trees",
    "\u2014of poplar and ash\u2014still breathe aloud",
    "like Indians, and if streams mumble",
    "their dark Esperanto, and grass snakes like soft signs",
    "in the Russian language disappear",
    "into thickets. To pack and set off, to leave",
    "without a trace, at noon, to vanish",
    "like fainting maidens. And burdocks, green",
    "armies of burdocks, and below, under the canvas",
    "of a Venetian caf\u00e9, the snails converse",
    "about eternity. But the cathedral rises,",
    "you remember, so straight, as straight",
    "as Sunday and white napkins and a bucket",
    "full of raspberries standing on the floor, and",
    "my desire which wasn\u2019t born yet,",
    "only gardens and weeds and the amber",
    "of Queen Anne cherries, and indecent Fredro.",
    "There was always too much of Lvov, no one could",
    "comprehend its boroughs, hear",
    "the murmur of each stone scorched",
    "by the sun, at night the Orthodox church\u2019s silence was unlike",
    "that of the cathedral, the Jesuits",
    "baptized plants, leaf by leaf, but they grew,",
    "grew so mindlessly, and joy hovered",
    "everywhere, in hallways and in coffee mills",
    "revolving by themselves, in blue",
    "teapots, in starch, which was the first",
    "formalist, in drops of rain and in the thorns",
    "of roses. Frozen forsythia yellowed by the window.",
    "The bells pealed and the air vibrated, the cornets",
    "of nuns sailed like schooners near",
    "the theater, there was so much of the world that",
    "it had to do encores over and over,",
    "the audience was in frenzy and didn\u2019t want",
    "to leave the house. My aunts couldn\u2019t have known",
    "yet that I\u2019d resurrect them,",
    "and lived so trustfully; so singly;",
    "servants, clean and ironed, ran for",
    "fresh cream, inside the houses",
    "a bit of anger and great expectation, Brzozowski",
    "came as a visiting lecturer, one of my",
    "uncles kept writing a poem entitled",
    ",",
    "dedicated to the Almighty, and there was too much",
    "of Lvov, it brimmed the container,",
    "it burst glasses, overflowed",
    "each pond, lake, smoked through every",
    "chimney, turned into fire, storm,",
    "laughed with lightning, grew meek,",
    "returned home, read the New Testament,",
    "slept on a sofa beside the Carpathian rug,",
    "there was too much of Lvov, and now",
    "there isn\u2019t any, it grew relentlessly",
    "and the scissors cut it, chilly gardeners",
    "as always in May, without mercy,",
    "without love, ah, wait till warm June",
    "comes with soft ferns, boundless",
    "fields of summer, i.e., the reality.",
    "But scissors cut it, along the line and through",
    "the fiber, tailors, gardeners, censors",
    "cut the body and the wreaths, pruning shears worked",
    "diligently, as in a child\u2019s cutout",
    "along the dotted line of a roe deer or a swan.",
    "Scissors, penknives, and razor blades scratched,",
    "cut, and shortened the voluptuous dresses",
    "of prelates, of squares and houses, and trees",
    "fell soundlessly, as in a jungle,",
    "and the cathedral trembled, people bade goodbye",
    "without handkerchiefs, no tears, such a dry",
    "mouth, I won\u2019t see you anymore, so much death",
    "awaits you, why must every city",
    "become Jerusalem and every man a Jew,",
    "and now in a hurry just",
    "pack, always, each day,",
    "and go breathless, go to Lvov, after all",
    "it exists, quiet and pure as",
    "a peach. It is everywhere."
