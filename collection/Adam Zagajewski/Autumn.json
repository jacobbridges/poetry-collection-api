    "Autumn is always too early.",
    "The peonies are still blooming, bees",
    "are still working out ideal states,",
    "and the cold bayonets of autumn",
    "suddenly glint in the fields and the wind",
    "rages.",
    "What is its origin? Why should it destroy",
    "dreams, arbors, memories?",
    "The alien enters the hushed woods,",
    "anger advancing, insinuating plague;",
    "woodsmoke, the raucous howls",
    "of Tatars.",
    "Autumn rips away leaves, names,",
    "fruit, it covers the borders and paths,",
    "extinguishes lamps and tapers; young",
    "autumn, lips purpled, embraces",
    "mortal creatures, stealing",
    "their existence.",
    "Sap flows, sacrificed blood,",
    "wine, oil, wild rivers,",
    "yellow rivers swollen with corpses,",
    "the curse flowing on: mud, lava, avalanche,",
    "gush.",
    "Breathless autumn, racing, blue",
    "knives glinting in her glance.",
    "She scythes names like herbs with her keen",
    "sickle, merciless in her blaze",
    "and her breath. Anonymous letter, terror,",
    "Red Army."
