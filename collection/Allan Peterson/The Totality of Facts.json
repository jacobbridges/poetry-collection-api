    "The laughing gull that flew behind the fencepost",
    "and never came out was the beginning",
    "and then a hand smaller than my hand covered Wisconsin",
    "with a gesture for explanation.",
    "In the afternoon there are pauses between the words",
    "through which commas can grow like daisy fleabane.",
    "A fish with an osprey in its back emerges from the Sound",
    "and nothing can be learned by more analysis.",
    "The book of her hair opens to its binding and I leaf through",
    "the glorious pages of appreciation and that\u2019s not all.",
    "We could not have turned fast enough to catch",
    "light and leftovers from so much of what happened:",
    "the swift figures behind you like a planet\u2019s dark",
    "companion, ships entering and leaving the hall closet",
    "the real and imagined between which is no difference."
