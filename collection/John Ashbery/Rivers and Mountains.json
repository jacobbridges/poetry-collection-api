    "On the secret map the assassins",
    "Cloistered, the Moon River was marked",
    "Near the eighteen peaks and the city",
    "Of humiliation and defeat\u2014wan ending",
    "Of the trail among dry, papery leaves",
    "Gray-brown quills like thoughts",
    "In the melodious but vast mass of today\u2019s",
    "Writing through fields and swamps",
    "Marked, on the map, with little bunches of weeds.",
    "Certainly squirrels lived in the woods",
    "But devastation and dull sleep still",
    "Hung over the land, quelled",
    "The rioters turned out of sleep in the peace of prisons",
    "Singing on marble factory walls",
    "Deaf consolation of minor tunes that pack",
    "The air with heavy invisible rods",
    "Pent in some sand valley from",
    "Which only quiet walking ever instructs.",
    "The bird flew over and",
    "Sat\u2014there was nothing else to do.",
    "Do not mistake its silence for pride or strength",
    "Or the waterfall for a harbor",
    "Full of light boats that is there",
    "Performing for thousands of people",
    "In clothes some with places to go",
    "Or games. Sometimes over the pillar",
    "Of square stones its impact",
    "Makes a light print.",
    "So going around cities",
    "To get to other places you found",
    "It all on paper but the land",
    "Was made of paper processed",
    "To look like ferns, mud or other",
    "Whose sea unrolled its magic",
    "Distances and then rolled them up",
    "Its secret was only a pocket",
    "After all but some corners are darker",
    "Than these moonless nights spent as on a raft",
    "In the seclusion of a melody heard",
    "As though through trees",
    "And you can never ignite their touch",
    "Long but there were homes",
    "Flung far out near the asperities",
    "Of a sharp, rocky pinnacle",
    "And other collective places",
    "Shadows of vineyards whose wine",
    "Tasted of the forest floor",
    "Fisheries and oyster beds",
    "Tides under the pole",
    "Seminaries of instruction, public",
    "Places for electric light",
    "And the major tax assessment area",
    "Wrinkled on the plan",
    "Of election to public office",
    "Sixty-two years old bath and breakfast",
    "The formal traffic, shadows",
    "To make it not worth joining",
    "After the ox had pulled away the cart.",
    "Your plan was to separate the enemy into two groups",
    "With the razor-edged mountains between.",
    "It worked well on paper",
    "But their camp had grown",
    "To be the mountains and the map",
    "Carefully peeled away and not torn",
    "Was the light, a tender but tough bark",
    "On everything. Fortunately the war was solved",
    "In another way by isolating the two sections",
    "Of the enemy\u2019s navy so that the mainland",
    "Warded away the big floating ships.",
    "Light bounced off the ends",
    "Of the small gray waves to tell",
    "Them in the observatory",
    "About the great drama that was being won",
    "To turn off the machinery",
    "And quietly move among the rustic landscape",
    "Scooping snow off the mountains rinsing",
    "The coarser ones that love had",
    "Slowly risen in the night to overflow",
    "Wetting pillow and petal",
    "Determined to place the letter",
    "On the unassassinated president\u2019s desk",
    "So that a stamp could reproduce all this",
    "In detail, down to the last autumn leaf",
    "And the affliction of June ride",
    "Slowly out into the sun-blackened landscape."
