    "Alone with our madness and favorite flower",
    "We see that there really is nothing left to write about.",
    "Or rather, it is necessary to write about the same old things",
    "In the same way, repeating the same things over and over",
    "For love to continue and be gradually different.",
    "Beehives and ants have to be re-examined eternally",
    "And the color of the day put in",
    "Hundreds of times and varied from summer to winter",
    "For it to get slowed down to the pace of an authentic",
    "Saraband and huddle there, alive and resting.",
    "Only then can the chronic inattention",
    "Of our lives drape itself around us, conciliatory",
    "And with one eye on those long tan plush shadows",
    "That speak so deeply into our unprepared knowledge",
    "Of ourselves, the talking engines of our day."
