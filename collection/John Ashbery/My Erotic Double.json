    "He says he doesn\u2019t feel like working today.",
    "It\u2019s just as well. Here in the shade",

    "Between us gets very intense when there are",
    "Fewer feelings around to confuse things.",
    "Another go-round? No, but the last things",
    "You always find to say are charming, and rescue me",
    "Before the night does. We are afloat",
    "On our dreams as on a barge made of ice,",
    "Shot through with questions and fissures of starlight",
    "That keep us awake, thinking about the dreams",
    "As they are happening. Some occurrence. You said it.",
    "I said it but I can hide it. But I choose not to.",
    "Thank you. You are a very pleasant person.",
    "Thank you. You are too."
