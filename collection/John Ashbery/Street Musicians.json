    "One died, and the soul was wrenched out",
    "Of the other in life, who, walking the streets",
    "Wrapped in an identity like a coat, sees on and on",
    "The same corners, volumetrics, shadows",
    "Under trees. Farther than anyone was ever",
    "Called, through increasingly suburban airs",
    "And ways, with autumn falling over everything:",
    "The plush leaves the chattels in barrels",
    "Of an obscure family being evicted",
    "Into the way it was, and is. The other beached",
    "Glimpses of what the other was up to:",
    "Revelations at last. So they grew to hate and forget each other.",
    "So I cradle this average violin that knows",
    "Only forgotten showtunes, but argues",
    "The possibility of free declamation anchored",
    "To a dull refrain, the year turning over on itself",
    "In November, with the spaces among the days",
    "More literal, the meat more visible on the bone.",
    "Our question of a place of origin hangs",
    "Like smoke: how we picnicked in pine forests,",
    "In coves with the water always seeping up, and left",
    "Our trash, sperm and excrement everywhere, smeared",
    "On the landscape, to make of us what we could."
