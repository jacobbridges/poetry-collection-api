    "Glion?\u0097Ah, twenty years, it cuts",
    "All meaning from a name!",
    "White houses prank where once were huts.",
    "Glion, but not the same!",
    "And yet I know not! All unchanged",
    "The turf, the pines, the sky!",
    "The hills in their old order ranged;",
    "The lake, with Chillon by!",
    "And, 'neath those chestnut-trees, where stiff",
    "And stony mounts the way,",
    "The crackling husk-heaps burn, as if",
    "I left them yesterday!",
    "Across the valley, on that slope,",
    "The huts of Avant shine!",
    "lts pines, under their branches, ope",
    "Ways for the pasturing kine.",
    "Full-foaming milk-pails, Alpine fare,",
    "Sweet heaps of fresh-cut grass,",
    "Invite to rest the traveller there",
    "Before he climb the pass\u0097",
    "The gentian-flower'd pass, its crown",
    "With yellow spires aflame;",
    "Whence drops the path to Alli\u00e8re down,",
    "And walls where Byron came,",
    "By their green river, who doth change",
    "His birth-name just below;",
    "Orchard, and croft, and full-stored grange",
    "Nursed by his pastoral flow.",
    "But stop!\u0097to fetch back thoughts that stray",
    "Beyond this gracious bound,",
    "The cone of Jaman, pale and gray,",
    "See, in the blue profound!",
    "Ah, Jaman! delicately tall",
    "Above his sun-warm'd firs\u0097",
    "What thoughts to me his rocks recall,",
    "What memories he stirs!",
    "And who but thou must be, in truth,",
    "Obermann! with me here?",
    "Thou master of my wandering youth,",
    "But left this many a year!",
    "Yes, I forget the world's work wrought,",
    "Its warfare waged with pain;",
    "An eremite with thee, in thought",
    "Once more I slip my chain,",
    "And to thy mountain-chalet come,",
    "And lie beside its door,",
    "And hear the wild bee's Alpine hum,",
    "And thy sad, tranquil lore!",
    "Again I feel the words inspire",
    "Their mournful calm; serene,",
    "Yet tinged with infinite desire",
    "For all that",
    "have been\u0097",
    "The harmony from which man swerved",
    "Made his life's rule once more!",
    "The universal order served,",
    "Earth happier than before!",
    "\u0097While thus I mused, night gently ran",
    "Down over hill and wood.",
    "Then, still and sudden, Obermann",
    "On the grass near me stood.",
    "Those pensive features well I knew,",
    "On my mind, years before,",
    "Imaged so oft! imaged so true!",
    "\u0097A shepherd's garb he wore,",
    "A mountain-flower was in his hand,",
    "A book was in his breast.",
    "Bent on my face, with gaze which scann'd",
    "My soul, his eyes did rest.",
    "\"And is it thou,\" he cried, \"so long",
    "Held by the world which we",
    "Loved not, who turnest from the throng",
    "Back to thy youth and me?",
    "\"And from thy world, with heart opprest,",
    "Choosest thou",
    "to turn?\u0097",
    "Ah me! we anchorites read things best,",
    "Clearest their course discern!",
    "\"Thou fledst me when the ungenial earth,",
    "Man's work-place, lay in gloom.",
    "Return'st thou in her hour of birth,",
    "Of hopes and hearts in bloom?",
    "\"Perceiv'st thou not the change of day?",
    "Ah! Carry back thy ken,",
    "What, some two thousand years! Survey",
    "The world as it was then!",
    "\"Like ours it look'd in outward air.",
    "Its head was clear and true,",
    "Sumptuous its clothing, rich its fare,",
    "No pause its action knew;",
    "\"Stout was its arm, each thew and bone",
    "Seem'd puissant and alive\u0097",
    "But, ah! its heart, its heart was stone,",
    "And so it could not thrive!",
    "\"On that hard Pagan world disgust",
    "And secret loathing fell.",
    "Deep weariness and sated lust",
    "Made human life a hell.",
    "\"In his cool hall, with haggard eyes,",
    "The Roman noble lay;",
    "He drove abroad, in furious guise,",
    "Along the Appian way.",
    "\"He made a feast, drank fierce and fast,",
    "And crown'd his hair with flowers\u0097",
    "No easier nor no quicker pass'd",
    "The impracticable hours.",
    "\"The brooding East with awe beheld",
    "Her impious younger world.",
    "The Roman tempest swell'd and swell'd,",
    "And on her head was hurl'd.",
    "\"The East bow'd low before the blast",
    "In patient, deep disdain;",
    "She let the legions thunder past,",
    "And plunged in thought again.",
    "\"So well she mused, a morning broke",
    "Across her spirit grey;",
    "A conquering, new-born joy awoke,",
    "And fill'd her life with day.",
    "\"'Poor world,' she cried, 'so deep accurst,",
    "That runn'st from pole to pole",
    "To seek a draught to slake thy thirst\u0097",
    "Go, seek it in thy soul!'",
    "\"She heard it, the victorious West,",
    "In crown and sword array'd!",
    "She felt the void which mined her breast,",
    "She shiver'd and obey'd.",
    "\"She veil'd her eagles, snapp'd her sword,",
    "And laid her sceptre down;",
    "Her stately purple she abhorr'd,",
    "And her imperial crown.",
    "\"She broke her flutes, she stopp'd her sports,",
    "Her artists could not please;",
    "She tore her books, she shut her courts,",
    "She fled her palaces;",
    "\"Lust of the eye and pride of life",
    "She left it all behind,",
    "And hurried, torn with inward strife,",
    "The wilderness to find.",
    "\"Tears wash'd the trouble from her face!",
    "She changed into a child!",
    "'Mid weeds and wrecks she stood\u0097a place",
    "Of ruin\u0097but she smiled!",
    "\"Oh, had I lived in that great day,",
    "How had its glory new",
    "Fill'd earth and heaven, and caught away",
    "My ravish'd spirit too!",
    "\"No thoughts that to the world belong",
    "Had stood against the wave",
    "Of love which set so deep and strong",
    "From Christ's then open grave.",
    "\"No cloister-floor of humid stone",
    "Had been too cold for me.",
    "For me no Eastern desert lone",
    "Had been too far to flee.",
    "\"No lonely life had pass'd too slow,",
    "When I could hourly scan",
    "Upon his Cross, with head sunk low,",
    "That nail'd, thorn-crowned Man!",
    "\"Could see the Mother with her Child",
    "Whose tender winning arts",
    "Have to his little arms beguiled",
    "So many wounded hearts!",
    "\"And centuries came and ran their course,",
    "And unspent all that time",
    "Still, still went forth that Child's dear force,",
    "And still was at its prime.",
    "\"Ay, ages long endured his span",
    "Of life\u0097'tis true received\u0097",
    "That gracious Child, that thorn-crown'd Man!",
    "\u0097He lived while we believed.",
    "\"While we believed, on earth he went,",
    "And open stood his grave.",
    "Men call'd from chamber, church, and tent;",
    "And Christ was by to save.",
    "\"Now he is dead! Far hence he lies",
    "In the lorn Syrian town;",
    "And on his grave, with shining eyes,",
    "The Syrian stars look down.",
    "\"In vain men still, with hoping new,",
    "Regard his death-place dumb,",
    "And say the stone is not yet to,",
    "And wait for words to come.",
    "\"Ah, o'er that silent sacred land,",
    "Of sun, and arid stone,",
    "And crumbling wall, and sultry sand,",
    "Sounds now one word alone!",
    "\"But slow that tide of common thought,",
    "Which bathed our life, retired;",
    "Slow, slow the old world wore to nought,",
    "And pulse by pulse expired.",
    "\"Its frame yet stood without a breach",
    "When blood and warmth were fled;",
    "And still it spake its wonted speech\u0097",
    "But every word was dead.",
    "\"And oh, we cried, that on this corse",
    "Might fall a freshening storm!",
    "Rive its dry bones, and with new force",
    "A new-sprung world inform!",
    "\"\u0097Down came the storm! O'er France it pass'd",
    "In sheets of scathing fire;",
    "All Europe felt that fiery blast,",
    "And shook as it rush'd by her.",
    "\"Down came the storm! In ruins fell",
    "The worn-out world we knew.",
    "It pass'd, that elemental swell!",
    "Again appear'd the blue;",
    "\"The sun shone in the new-wash'd sky,",
    "And what from heaven saw he?",
    "Blocks of the past, like icebergs high,",
    "Float on a rolling sea!",
    "\"Upon them plies the race of man",
    "All it before endeavour'd;",
    "'Ye live,' I cried, 'ye work and plan,",
    "And know not ye are sever'd!",
    "\"'Poor fragments of a broken world",
    "Whereon men pitch their tent!",
    "Why were ye too to death not hurl'd",
    "When your world's day was spent?",
    "\"'That glow of central fire is done",
    "Which with its fusing flame",
    "Knit all your parts, and kept you one\u0097",
    "But ye, ye are the same!",
    "\"'The past, its mask of union on,",
    "Had ceased to live and thrive.",
    "The past, its mask of union gone,",
    "Say, is it more alive?",
    "\"'Your creeds are dead, your rites are dead,",
    "Your social order too!",
    "Where tarries he, the Power who said:",
    "\"'The millions suffer still, and grieve,",
    "And what can helpers heal",
    "With old-world cures men half believe",
    "For woes they wholly feel?",
    "\"'And yet men have such need of joy!",
    "But joy whose grounds are true;",
    "And joy that should all hearts employ",
    "As when the past was new.",
    "\"'Ah, not the emotion of that past,",
    "Its common hope, were vain!",
    "Some new such hope must dawn at last,",
    "Or man must toss in pain.",
    "\"'But now the old is out of date,",
    "The new is not yet born,",
    "And who can be",
    "elate,",
    "While the world lies forlorn?'",
    "\"Then to the wilderness I fled.\u0097",
    "There among Alpine snows",
    "And pastoral huts I hid my head,",
    "And sought and found repose.",
    "\"It was not yet the appointed hour.",
    "Sad, patient, and resign'd,",
    "I watch'd the crocus fade and flower,",
    "I felt the sun and wind.",
    "\"The day I lived in was not mine,",
    "Man gets no second day.",
    "In dreams I saw the future shine\u0097",
    "But ah! I could not stay!",
    "\"Action I had not, followers, fame;",
    "I pass'd obscure, alone.",
    "The after-world forgets my name,",
    "Nor do I wish it known.",
    "\"Composed to bear, I lived and died,",
    "And knew my life was vain.",
    "With fate I murmur not, nor chide;",
    "At S\u00e8vres by the Seine",
    "\"(If Paris that brief flight allow)",
    "My humble tomb explore!",
    "It bears:",
    "and no more.",
    "\"But thou, whom fellowship of mood",
    "Did make from haunts of strife",
    "Come to my mountain-solitude,",
    "And learn my frustrate life;",
    "\"O thou, who, ere thy flying span",
    "Was past of cheerful youth,",
    "Didst find the solitary man",
    "And love his cheerless truth\u0097",
    "\"Despair not thou as I despair'd,",
    "Nor be cold gloom thy prison!",
    "Forward the gracious hours have fared,",
    "And see! the sun is risen!",
    "\"He breaks the winter of the past;",
    "A green, new earth appears.",
    "Millions, whose life in ice lay fast,",
    "Have thoughts, and smiles, and tears.",
    "\"What though there still need effort, strife?",
    "Though much be still unwon?",
    "Yet warm it mounts, the hour of life!",
    "Death's frozen hour is done!",
    "\"The world's great order dawns in sheen,",
    "After long darkness rude,",
    "Divinelier imaged, clearer seen,",
    "With happier zeal pursued.",
    "\"With hope extinct and brow composed",
    "I mark'd the present die;",
    "Its term of life was nearly closed,",
    "Yet it had more than I.",
    "\"But thou, though to the world's new hour",
    "Thou come with aspect marr'd,",
    "Shorn of the joy, the bloom, the power,",
    "Which best befits its bard\u0097",
    "\"Though more than half thy years be past,",
    "And spent thy youthful prime;",

    "Hope to a world new-made!",
    "\"Help it to fill that deep desire,",
    "The want which rack'd our brain,",
    "Consumed our heart with thirst like fire,",
    "Immedicable pain;",
