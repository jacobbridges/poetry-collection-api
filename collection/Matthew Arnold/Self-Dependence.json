    "Weary of myself, and sick of asking",
    "What I am, and what I ought to be,",
    "At this vessel's prow I stand, which bears me",
    "Forwards, forwards, o'er the starlit sea.",
    "And a look of passionate desire",
    "O'er the sea and to the stars I send:",
    "\"Ye who from my childhood up have calm'd me,",
    "Calm me, ah, compose me to the end!",
    "\"Ah, once more,\" I cried, \"ye stars, ye waters,",
    "On my heart your mighty charm renew;",
    "Still, still let me, as I gaze upon you,",
    "Feel my soul becoming vast like you!\"",
    "From the intense, clear, star-sown vault of heaven,",
    "Over the lit sea's unquiet way,",
    "In the rustling night-air came the answer:",
    "\"Wouldst thou",
    "as these are?",
    "as they.",
    "\"Unaffrighted by the silence round them,",
    "Undistracted by the sights they see,",
    "These demand not that the things without them",
    "Yield them love, amusement, sympathy.",
    "\"And with joy the stars perform their shining,",
    "And the sea its long moon-silver'd roll;",
    "For self-poised they live, nor pine with noting",
    "All the fever of some differing soul.",
    "\"Bounded by themselves, and unregardful",
    "In what state God's other works may be,",
    "In their own tasks all their powers pouring,",
    "These attain the mighty life you see.\"",
    "O air-born voice! long since, severely clear,",
    "A cry like thine in mine own heart I hear:",
    "\"Resolve to be thyself; and know that he,",
    "Who finds himself, loses his misery!\""
