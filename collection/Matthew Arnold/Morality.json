    "We cannot kindle when we will",
    "The fire which in the heart resides;",
    "The spirit bloweth and is still,",
    "In mystery our soul abides.",
    "But tasks in hours of insight will'd",
    "Can be through hours of gloom fulfill'd.",
    "With aching hands and bleeding feet",
    "We dig and heap, lay stone on stone;",
    "We bear the burden and the heat",
    "Of the long day, and wish 'twere done.",
    "Not till the hours of light return,",
    "All we have built do we discern.",
    "Then, when the clouds are off the soul,",
    "When thou dost bask in Nature's eye,",
    "Ask, how",
    "view'd thy self-control,",
    "Thy struggling, task'd morality\u0097",
    "Nature, whose free, light, cheerful air,",
    "Oft made thee, in thy gloom, despair.",
    "And she, whose censure thou dost dread,",
    "Whose eye thou wast afraid to seek,",
    "See, on her face a glow is spread,",
    "A strong emotion on her cheek!",
    "\"Ah, child!\" she cries, \"that strife divine,",
    "Whence was it, for it is not mine?",
    "\"There is no effort on",
    "brow\u0097",
    "I do not strive, I do not weep;",
    "I rush with the swift spheres and glow",
    "In joy, and when I will, I sleep.",
    "Yet that severe, that earnest air,",
    "I saw, I felt it once\u0097but where?",
    "\"I knew not yet the gauge of time,",
    "Nor wore the manacles of space;",
    "I felt it in some other clime,",
    "I saw it in some other place.",
    "'Twas when the heavenly house I trod,",
    "And lay upon the breast of God.\""
