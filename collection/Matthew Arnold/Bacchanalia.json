    "The evening comes, the fields are still.",
    "The tinkle of the thirsty rill,",

    "And o'er the plain, where the dead age",
    "Did its now silent warfare wage\u2014",
    "O'er that wide plain, now wrapt in gloom,",
    "Where many a splendour finds its tomb,",
    "Many spent fames and fallen mights\u2014",
    "The one or two immortal lights",
    "Rise slowly up into the sky",
    "To shine there everlastingly,",
