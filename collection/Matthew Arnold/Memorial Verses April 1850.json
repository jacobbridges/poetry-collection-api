    "Goethe in Weimar sleeps, and Greece,",
    "Long since, saw Byron's struggle cease.",
    "But one such death remain'd to come;",
    "The last poetic voice is dumb\u2014",
    "We stand to-day by Wordsworth's tomb.",
    "When Byron's eyes were shut in death,",
    "We bow'd our head and held our breath.",
    "He taught us little; but our soul",
    "Had",
    "him like the thunder's roll.",
    "With shivering heart the strife we saw",
    "Of passion with eternal law;",
    "And yet with reverential awe",
    "We watch'd the fount of fiery life",
    "Which served for that Titanic strife.",
    "When Goethe's death was told, we said:",
    "Sunk, then, is Europe's sagest head.",
    "Physician of the iron age,",
    "Goethe has done his pilgrimage.",
    "He took the suffering human race,",
    "He read each wound, each weakness clear;",
    "And struck his finger on the place,",
    "And said:",
    "He look'd on Europe's dying hour",
    "Of fitful dream and feverish power;",
    "His eye plunged down the weltering strife,",
    "The turmoil of expiring life\u2014",
    "He said: The end is everywhere,",
    "Art still has truth, take refuge there!",
    "And he was happy, if to know",
    "Causes of things, and far below",
    "His feet to see the lurid flow",
    "Of terror, and insane distress,",
    "And headlong fate, be happiness.",
    "And Wordsworth!\u2014Ah, pale ghosts, rejoice!",
    "For never has such soothing voice",
    "Been to your shadowy world convey'd,",
    "Since erst, at morn, some wandering shade",
    "Heard the clear song of Orpheus come",
    "Through Hades, and the mournful gloom.",
    "Wordsworth has gone from us\u2014and ye,",
    "Ah, may ye feel his voice as we!",
    "He too upon a wintry clime",
    "Had fallen\u2014on this iron time",
    "Of doubts, disputes, distractions, fears.",
    "He found us when the age had bound",
    "Our souls in its benumbing round;",
    "He spoke, and loosed our heart in tears.",
    "He laid us as we lay at birth",
    "On the cool flowery lap of earth,",
    "Smiles broke from us and we had ease;",
    "The hills were round us, and the breeze",
    "Went o'er the sun-lit fields again;",
    "Our foreheads felt the wind and rain.",
    "Our youth return'd; for there was shed",
    "On spirits that had long been dead,",
    "Spirits dried up and closely furl'd,",
    "The freshness of the early world.",
    "Ah! since dark days still bring to light",
    "Man's prudence and man's fiery might,",
    "Time may restore us in his course",
    "Goethe's sage mind and Byron's force;",
    "But where will Europe's latter hour",
    "Again find Wordsworth's healing power?",
    "Others will teach us how to dare,",
    "And against fear our breast to steel;",
    "Others will strengthen us to bear\u2014",
    "But who, ah! who, will make us feel?",
    "The cloud of mortal destiny,",
    "Others will front it fearlessly\u2014",
    "But who, like him, will put it by?",
    "Keep fresh the grass upon his grave,",
    "O Rotha, with thy living wave!",
    "Sing him thy best! for few or none",
    "Hears thy voice right, now he is gone."
