    "in a different version of this I'm the one",
    "sitting up in bed while the nurse says",
    "deep breaths listens to my lungs through",
    "the cold antenna of her stethoscope you're the one",
    "sitting in a chair in the corner",
    "with a half hearted smile plastered to your face",
    "in a different version of this",
    "we're both in bed hunched over",
    "while two nurses sisters actually listen",
    "to our lungs your husband and my wife",
    "sit in the corners of the room",
    "both of them completely useless",
    "in a different version of this I'm in a chair",
    "in the corner while my sister sits up",
    "in bed you're the nurse who listens",
    "to my sister breathing you glance at me for",
    "an instant and return my uncertain smile",
    "in a different version of this I sit up",
    "abruptly in bed I'm breathing deeply you",
    "put your hand on my back and say",
    "go back to sleep you're fine everything is fine"
