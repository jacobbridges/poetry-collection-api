    "Did I ever tell you that Mrs. McCave",
    "Had twenty-three sons and she named them all Dave?",
    "Well, she did. And that wasn't a smart thing to do.",
    "You see, when she wants one and calls out, \"Yoo-Hoo!",
    "Come into the house, Dave!\" she doesn't get",
    ".",
    "All twenty-three Daves of hers come on the run!",
    "This makes things quite difficult at the McCaves'",
    "As you can imagine, with so many Daves.",
    "And often she wishes that, when they were born,",
    "She had named one of them Bodkin Van Horn",
    "And one of them Hoos-Foos. And one of them Snimm.",
    "And one of them Hot-Shot. And one Sunny Jim.",

    "And one of them Zanzibar Buck-Buck McFate ...",
    "But she didn't do it. And now it's too late."
