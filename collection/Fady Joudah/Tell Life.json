    "For Ghassan Zaqtan",
    "1",
    "I now release from my blood the bird of thirty she wasted",
    "that\u2019s how wars crumble us",
    "I now tell those who are exhausted from the expense",
    "of children the secret of happiness and happiness itself",
    "from what is arrived at but doesn\u2019t come",
    "from the language of balance",
    "defeat has the taste",
    "of being shrouded with another\u2019s banner",
    "while your enemies chant your names",
    "Some music some shelling",
    "will strike our dead who flew off in the early raids",
    "have you seen them return from their flying?",
    "They stayed behind hanging by the thread",
    "of their surprise and by their women\u2019s hair",
    "We will dance in the wreckage drink the coffee",
    "our dead left brewing we will open our tombs",
    "to windows for the sea in order",
    "for the sea to remain besieged",
    "Right here right here",
    "a corpse shook its trunk in the earth a corpse snapped",
    "God\u2019s ropes houses gathered then hid",
    "what\u2019s easy to interpret of people\u2019s speech",
    "Which mourners ebbed and turned the sea to tombstones",
    "for our dead which poem was said and revived us?",
    "And that huge rose of ours our only bewilderment",
    "our offense on earth our balcony",
    "on the kingdom of heaven the grandfather\u2019s house",
    "a hand that gestures farewell",
    "in the roar of the massacre a white hand like old time",
    "a free hand like death after death",
    "Tell my love space has been plucked",
    "tell her to sleep on disaffection\u2019s stone",
    "2",
    "Two raids three raids a whole morning",
    "a year of long bombardment over your going",
    "Did you forget a newspaper of palm fronds",
    "a time of white dawn some hay from last season\u2019s siege",
    "a brief greeting like a mumbling",
    "on mornings of slow advance",
    "a suitcase a rug a palm with which you touched the evening",
    "of shelling into a meaning",
    "for a people kind and assured and silent?",
    "Whenever glass shook you would shriek",
    "kid I pluck",
    "your death\u2019s anemone and eat it",
    "Each land has its people",
    "each time has its folks and time",
    "for a while now has been standing on our throats",
    "As if we don\u2019t love or hate as if we\u2019ve seen the land",
    "only as a bracelet a house a dress a poem left filled",
    "with those who were killed without war",
    "3",
    "Memory shrinks until it fits in a fist",
    "memory shrinks without forgetting",
    "a boy in a farm a chicken on a roof",
    "a dot on the planet mysterious and intuitive like parents",
    "or a tree for a hat with prairies",
    "for a dictionary and days like sleeves",
    "short in summer cotton in winter",
    "they resist when squeezed between our knees",
    "A not so First World rains on a calm boy",
    "torn apart like a tattered tent",
    "The lily of words enters his heart takes a wedding",
    "by the horns a well-trained bulbul",
    "by the scandalous fruit rush of the river",
    "His return will be washed shrouded",
    "a field\u2019s first flower guarded by dirt",
    "Coffee coffee for the beautiful one",
    "whose heart\u2019s a tambourine this morning",
    "while war shouts cold on slopes",
    "4",
    "In the saddles grass grows",
    "warmth matures in oleander",
    "the river pours in your absence",
    "everything will happen",
    "I exchanged half of my books to sit near you",
    "flung my hand so that it may see you",
    "then retrieved it to touch what it saw",
    "We slept like sponges near the river butterflies descended",
    "from the ribs of shadow then left behind",
    "a mirror pitched like a house of jinn",
    "5",
    "It\u2019ll be difficult that you go",
    "before you choose a grave fit for sleep",
    "It\u2019ll be difficult that you die",
    "before you choose a grave fit for running",
    "for flood swimming for dense reeds by irrigation channels",
    "for bird snares for the lettuce garden in the backyard",
    "for old dry thatch on mud roofs",
    "for jujube shrubs for climbing on trucks and holding on",
    "to vegetable boxes for the diffusion of secrets",
    "loading and unloading in the big market",
    "A grave fit for you to see Jericho light up",
    "through the windows as a neon garden",
    "the refugee camps by the marshes touch",
    "A grave fit for you to see Jericho\u2019s convent toss",
    "grass liquor our way fir for some arches",
    "where oleander wilts near Bedouin tents",
    "And their watchdogs will dig and dig",
    "and dig and dig and you won\u2019t come",
    "6",
    "And the mules in the junkyards",
    "does anyone feed their loneliness when they cry?",
    "Or has anyone quenched their oneness or washed",
    "their dead necks or visited them to remember how",
    "they blackened in their sleep?",
    "The mules the movie extras who fold their torsos",
    "in the packed air as lineage",
    "floats on light an icon",
    "of wondrous dust and riddles",
    "7",
    "And our neighbor the one whose voice",
    "fenced us with reeds all day and all night",
    "She would forget her rings in our hands",
    "two boys who used to dance for her"
