    "My bands of silk and miniver",
    "Momently grew heavier;",
    "The black gauze was beggarly thin;",

    "I could not suck the moonlight in.",
    "Harlequin in lozenges",
    "Of love and hate, I walked in these",
    "Striped and ragged rigmaroles;",
    "Along the pavement my footsoles",
    "Trod warily on living coals.",
    "Shouldering the thoughts I loathed,",
    "In their corrupt disguises clothed,",
    "Morality I could not tear",
    "From my ribs, to leave them bare",
    "Ivory in silver air.",
    "There I walked, and there I raged;",
    "The spiritual savage caged",
    "Within my skeleton, raged afresh",
    "To feel, behind a carnal mesh,",
    "The clean bones crying in the flesh."
