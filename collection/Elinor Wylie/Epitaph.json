    "For this she starred her eyes with salt",
    "And scooped her temples thin,",
    "Until her face shone pure of fault",
    "From the forehead to the chin.",
    "In coldest crucibles of pain",
    "Her shrinking flesh was fired",
    "And smoothed into a finer grain",
    "To make it more desired.",
    "Pain left her lips more clear than glass;",
    "It colored and cooled her hand.",
    "She lay a field of scented grass",
    "Yielded as pasture land.",
    "For this her loveliness was curved",
    "And carved as silver is:",
    "For this she was brave: but she deserved",
    "A better grave than this."
