    "Minutes before the rain begins",
    "I always waken, listening",
    "to the world hold its breath,",
    "as if a phone had rung once in a far",
    "room or a door had creaked",
    "in the darkness.",
    "Perhaps the genes of some forebear",
    "startle in me, some tribal warrior",
    "keeping watch on a crag beside a loch,",
    "miserable in the cold,",
    "though I think it is a woman's waiting",
    "I have come to know,",
    "a Loyalist hiding in the woods,",
    "muffling the coughing of her child",
    "against her linen skirts, her dark head",
    "bent over his, her fear spent",
    "somewhere else in time,",
    "leaving only this waiting,",
    "and I hope she escaped",
    "with her child, and I suppose she did.",
    "If not, I wouldn't be lying here awake,",
    "alive, listening for the rain to begin",
    "so that she can run, the sound",
    "of her footsteps lost, the sight",
    "of them blotted away on the path."
