    "\"I gave birth to a princess,\" her mother",
    "once told me, and I thought of my son pouring",
    "his Grape-Nuts in the garage so as not to wake her,",
    "of the moment her baby, seeing her",
    "now a separate entity, seemed not to breathe,",
    "refused to blink her sapphire eyes.",
    "I remembered again last night as she",
    "and I crossed a Florida street, the caution",
    "light running gold streamers",
    "over the dark sweep of her hair,",
    "when a young man coming toward us halted",
    "midway a moment, stunned, before moving on.",
    "So what is this Divine Right\u2014less",
    "than bloodlines, or more? More than symmetry",
    "of face or a silver necklace nestled",
    "at a flawless throat, the nerve to send back",
    "bad food in restaurants, more than the big,",
    "loopy handwriting of the generous spirit?",
    "Call it bravery, that eager readiness",
    "in the eyes, the quality of the light shining",
    "there. Call it blessed assurance.",
    "Today, pony-tailed, she luxuriates in sun,",
    "opulent in a hot pink bikini. In deference",
    "the ocean leans away, a backdrop.",
    "I find myself bent, studying the shore for perfect",
    "shells to lay at her feet\u2014cat's paw, prickly",
    "cockle, angel wing. Call it homage, more or less."
