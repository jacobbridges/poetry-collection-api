    "As if he had been poured",
    "in tar, he lies",
    "on a pillow of turf",
    "and seems to weep",
    "the black river of himself.",
    "The grain of his wrists",
    "is like bog oak,",
    "the ball of his heel",
    "like a basalt egg.",
    "His instep has shrunk",
    "cold as a swan's foot",
    "or a wet swamp root.",
    "His hips are the ridge",
    "and purse of a mussel,",
    "his spine an eel arrested",
    "under a glisten of mud.",
    "The head lifts,",
    "the chin is a visor",
    "raised above the vent",
    "of his slashed throat",
    "that has tanned and toughened.",
    "The cured wound",
    "opens inwards to a dark",
    "elderberry place.",
    "Who will say 'corpse'",
    "to his vivid cast?",
    "Who will say 'body'",
    "to his opaque repose?",
    "And his rusted hair,",
    "a mat unlikely",
    "as a foetus's.",
    "I first saw his twisted face",
    "in a photograph,",
    "a head and shoulder",
    "out of the peat,",
    "bruised like a forceps baby,",
    "but now he lies",
    "perfected in my memory,",
    "down to the red horn",
    "of his nails,",
    "hung in the scales",
    "with beauty and atrocity:",
    "with the Dying Gaul",
    "too strictly compassed",
    "on his shield,",
    "with the actual weight",
    "of each hooded victim,",
    "slashed and dumped."
