    "Is it possible",

    "Is it possible",
    "So cruel intent,",
    "So hasty heat and so soon spent,",

    "Is it possible?",
    "Is it possible",
    "That any may find",
    "Within one heart so diverse mind,",
    "To change or turn as weather and wind?",

    "That turns as oft as chance on die,",

    "All is possible",
    "Whoso list believe.",
    "Trust therefore first, and after preve,",
    "As men wed ladies by licence and leave.",
    "All is possible."
