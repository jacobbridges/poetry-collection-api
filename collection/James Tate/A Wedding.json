    "She was in terrible pain the whole day,",
    "as she had been for months: a slipped disc,",
    "and there is nothing more painful. She",
    "herself was a nurse\u2019s aide, also a poet",
    "just beginning to make a name for her",
    "nom de plume. As with most things in life,",
    "it happened when she was changing channels",
    "on her television. The lucky man, on the other",
    "hand, was smiling for the first time",
    "in his life, and it was fake. He was",
    "an aspiring philosopher of dubious potential,",
    "very serious, but somehow lacking in",
    "essential depth. He could have been",
    "an adequate undertaker. It was not the first",
    "time for either of them. It was a civil",
    "service, with no music, few flowers.",
    "Still, there was a slow and erratic tide",
    "of champagne\u2014corks shot clear into the trees.",
    "And flashcubes, instant photos, some blurred",
    "and some too revealing, cake slices that aren\u2019t",
    "what they were meant to be. The bride slept",
    "through much of it, and never did we figure out",
    "who was on whose team. I think the groom",
    "meant it in the end when he said, \u201cWe never",
    "thought anyone would come.\u201d We were not the first",
    "to arrive, nor the last to leave. Who knows,",
    "it may all turn out for the best. And who",
    "really cares about such special days, they",
    "are not what we live for."
