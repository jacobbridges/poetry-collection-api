    "Although the depiction of living forms",
    "was not explicitly forbidden, the only good news",
    "about famines was that the station was empty.",
    "It was about 2 A.M. The truck drove away.",
    "A tropical insect that lives in enormous cities",
    "stroked my hair awkwardly, organizing everyone's",
    "schedule. She drove me back to my hotel",
    "in a misty and allusive style, while the old",
    "schools continued the process of devolution.",
    "Part of the roof was loose and flapped noisily",
    "in the wind, who needed work like that?",
    "Poor brethren, do you have any good prose yet?",
    "The New Chinese fiction is getting better,",
    "I suspect, people walking and thinking and fussing,",
    "with a nest to fly out of, with a less intimate footing.",

    "Keep up your music, my dears; there were a lot of people",
    "like that, with strange eyes, green fields and orchards.",
    "The little house they sat in produced simple people,",
    "cars full of blood, all they needed was a hat,",
    "extramusical sounds, purging the emotions.",
    "Expect no mercy, I said, from the sickbay.",
    "And try to imagine Howard Hughes piloting the plane",
    "that flew Cary Grant and Barbara Hutton off",
    "toward their marriage in 1950. Well, don't bother.",
    "The New Chinese fiction shouldn't concern itself",
    "with anything other than a stolen turnip",
    "and a coldness in the heart, and a lit window,",
    "a young man on a horse appearing and then disappearing."
