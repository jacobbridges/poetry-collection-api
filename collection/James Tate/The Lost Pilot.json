    "the residue of a stranger\u2019s life,",
    "that I should pursue you.",
    "My head cocked toward the sky,",
    "I cannot get off the ground,",
    "and, you, passing over again,",
    "fast, perfect, and unwilling",
    "to tell me that you are doing",
    "well, or that it was mistake",
    "that placed you in that world,",
    "and me in this; or that misfortune",
    "placed these worlds in us."
