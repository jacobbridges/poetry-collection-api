    "I was chasing this blue butterfly down",
    "the road when a car came by and clipped me.",
    "It was nothing serious, but it angered me and",
    "I turned around and cursed the driver who didn't",

    "was nowhere to be seen. One of the Doubleday",
    "girls came running up the street with her toy",
    "poodle toward me. I stopped her and asked,",
    "\"Have you seen a blue butterfly around here?\"",

    "she said. \"Thanks,\" I said, and walked briskly",
    "toward the tree. It was fluttering from flower",
    "to flower in Mr. Doubleday's extensive garden,",

    "it was only in a dream, I wanted to confirm it.",
    "I was a blind beggar on the streets of Cordoba",
    "when I first saw it, and now, again it was here."
