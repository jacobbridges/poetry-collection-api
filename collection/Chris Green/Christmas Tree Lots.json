    "Christmas trees lined like war refugees,",
    "a fallen army made to stand in their greens.",
    "Cut down at the foot, on their last leg,",
    "they pull themselves up, arms raised.",
    "We drop them like wood;",
    "tied, they are driven through the streets,",
    "dragged through the door, cornered",
    "in a room, given a single blanket,",
    "only water to drink, surrounded by joy.",
    "Forced to wear a gaudy gold star,",
    "to surrender their pride,",
    "they do their best to look alive."
