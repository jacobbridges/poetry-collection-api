    "Kitty Goes Kommando and the Goldman Rats \u2014 Phooey!",
    "That blue scaffolding holds up the sky. Who did we think",
    "we were padlocking in, or out? Give me that huge",
    "looping black script no one can read, a secret glyph,",
    "and just where someone has smashed the window, Jesus",
    "the Way the Truth the Life and a dented aluminum frame.",
    "He bent down, we know, and wrote something illegible on the ground.",
    "A toothy black-and-white dinosaur gapes. I like the crack",
    "in this wall of monsters where skylines topple and ogres",
    "twiddle train tracks in their claws like pipe cleaners.",
    "Down the long, semi-abandoned street in Queens",
    "calligraphy gallops toward the shop displaying,",
    "like guitar strings, seven different iron rods",
    "for gates. Hole in the wall, rose sound-hole,",
    "ribbed sounding board \u2014 always from fissures and gaps",
    "melody strains as trains thunderclank across",
    "the girdered overpass, a siren keens, and a solitary man",
    "ambles past amputated acacias fisting out with leaves."
