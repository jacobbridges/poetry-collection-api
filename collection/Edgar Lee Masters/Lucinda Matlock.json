    "I went to the dances at Chandlerville,",
    "And played snap-out at Winchester.",
    "One time we changed partners,",
    "Driving home in the moonlight of middle June,",
    "And then I found Davis.",
    "We were married and lived together for seventy years,",
    "Enjoying, working, raising the twelve children,",
    "Eight of whom we lost",
    "Ere I had reached the age of sixty.",
    "I spun, I wove, I kept the house, I nursed the sick,",
    "I made the garden, and for holiday",
    "Rambled over the fields where sang the larks,",
    "And by Spoon River gathering many a shell,",
    "And many a flower and medicinal weed \u2014",
    "Shouting to the wooded hills, singing to the green valleys.",
    "At ninety-six I had lived enough, that is all,",
    "And passed to a sweet repose.",
    "What is this I hear of sorrow and weariness,",
    "Anger, discontent and drooping hopes?",
    "Degenerate sons and daughters,",
    "Life is too strong for you \u2014",
    "It takes life to love Life."
