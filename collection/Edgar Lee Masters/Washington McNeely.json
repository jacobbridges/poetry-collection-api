    "Rich, honored by my fellow citizens,",
    "The father of many children, born of a noble mother,",

    "The while my life went on, getting more riches and honors\u2014",
    "Resting under my cedar tree at evening.",
    "The years went on.",
    "I sent the girls to Europe;",

    "I sat under my cedar tree.",
    "All were gone, or broken-winged or devoured by life\u2014",
    "I sat under my cedar tree.",
    "My mate, the mother of them, was taken\u2014",
    "I sat under my cedar tree",
    "Till ninety years were tolled.",
    "O maternal Earth, which rocks the fallen leaf to sleep!"
