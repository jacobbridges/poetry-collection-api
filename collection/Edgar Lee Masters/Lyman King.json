    "You may think, passer-by, that Fate",
    "Is a pit-fall outside of yourself,",
    "Around which you may walk by the use of foresight",
    "And wisdom.",
    "Thus you believe, viewing the lives of other men,",
    "As one who in God-like fashion bends over an anthill,",
    "Seeing how their difficulties could be avoided.",
    "But pass on into life:",
    "In time you shall see Fate approach you",
    "In the shape of your own image in the mirror;",
    "Or you shall sit alone by your own hearth,",
    "And suddenly the chair by you shall hold a guest,",
    "And you shall know that guest,",
    "And read the authentic message of his eyes."
