    "Have any of you, passers-by,",
    "Had an old tooth that was an unceasing discomfort?",
    "Or a pain in the side that never quite left you?",
    "Or a malignant growth that grew with time?",
    "So that even in profoundest slumber",
    "There was shadowy consciousness or the phantom of thought",
    "Of the tooth, the side, the growth?",
    "Even so thwarted love, or defeated ambition,",
    "Or a blunder in life which mixed your life",
    "Hopelessly to the end,",
    "Will like a tooth, or a pain in the side,",
    "Float through your dreams in the final sleep",
    "Till perfect freedom from the earth-sphere",
    "Comes to you as one who wakes",
    "Healed and glad in the morning!"
