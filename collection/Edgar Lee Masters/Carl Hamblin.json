    "The press of the Spoon River",
    "was wrecked,",
    "And I was tarred and feathered,",
    "For publishing this on the day the Anarchists were hanged in Chicago:",
    "\"I saw a beautiful woman with bandaged eyes",
    "Standing on the steps of a marble temple.",
    "Great multitudes passed in front of her,",
    "Lifting their faces to her imploringly.",
    "In her left hand she held a sword.",
    "She was brandishing the sword,",
    "Sometimes striking a child, again a laborer,",
    "Again a slinking woman, again a lunatic.",
    "In her right hand she held a scale;",
    "Into the scale pieces of gold were tossed",
    "By those who dodged the strokes of the sword.",
    "A man in a black gown read from a manuscript:",
    "'She is no respecter of persons.'",
    "Then a youth wearing a red cap",
    "Leaped to her side and snatched away the bandage.",
    "And lo, the lashes had been eaten away",
    "From the oozy eye-lids;",
    "The eye-balls were seared with a milky mucus;",
    "The madness of a dying soul",
    "Was written on her face i",
    "But the multitude saw why she wore the bandage.\""
