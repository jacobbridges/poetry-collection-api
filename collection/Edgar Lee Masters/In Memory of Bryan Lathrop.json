    "So in Pieria, from the wedded bliss",
    "Of Time and Memory, the Muses came",
    "To be the means of rich oblivion,",
    "And rest from cares. And when the Thunderer",
    "Took heaven, then the Titans warred on him",
    "For pity of mankind. But the great law,",
    "Which is the law of music, not of bread,",
    "Set Atlas for a pillar, manacled",
    "His brother to the rocks of the Scythia,",
    "And under Aetna fixed the furious Typhon.",
    "So should thought rule, not force. And Amphion,",
    "Pursuing justice, entered Thebes and slew",
    "His mother's spouse; but when he would make sure",
    "And fortify the city, then he took",
    "The lyre that Hermes gave, and played, and watched",
    "The stones move and assemble, till a wall",
    "Engirded Thebes and kept the citadel",
    "Beyond the reach of arrows and of fire.",
    "What other power but harmony can build",
    "A city, and what gift so magical",
    "As that by which a city lifts its walls?",
    "So men, in years to come, shall feel the power",
    "Of this man moving through the high-ranged thought",
    "Which plans for beauty, builds for larger life.",
    "The stones shall rise in towers to answer him."
