    "\"Kinetics Researcher from Vienna [Max Thun-Hohenstetin], 1930,\" by August Sander",
    "Nakedness ought to be undatable,",
    "Proof that the latest phenotype is made",
    "On the same plan as his original",
    "Who sauntered through the Garden, unafraid.",
    "Even without the cotton pouch he wears",
    "As a concession to the prudery",
    "Of viewers not evolved enough to share",
    "His unembarrassed objectivity,",
    "The willed detachment on his face would show,",
    "Better than any clothes, the difference",
    "Between the antique innocence that knows",
    "No shame, and cultivated shamelessness."
