    "This morning Hitler spoke in Danzig, we heard his voice.",
    "A man of genius: that is, of amazing",
    "Ability, courage, devotion, cored on a sick child\u2019s soul,",
    "Heard clearly through the dog-wrath, a sick child",
    "Wailing in Danzig; invoking destruction and wailing at it.",
    "Here, the day was extremely hot; about noon",
    "A south wind like a blast from hell\u2019s mouth spilled a slight rain",
    "On the parched land, and at five a light earthquake",
    "Danced the house, no harm done. To-night I have been amusing myself",
    "Watching the blood-red moon droop slowly",
    "Into black sea through bursts of dry lightning and distant thunder.",
    "Well: the day is a poem: but too much",
    "Like one of Jeffers\u2019s, crusted with blood and barbaric omens,",
    "Painful to excess, inhuman as a hawk\u2019s cry."
