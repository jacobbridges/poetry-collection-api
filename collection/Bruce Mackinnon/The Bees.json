    "One day the bees start wandering off, no one knows why.",
    "First one doesn\u2019t come back, and then another and another,",
    "until those who are supposed to stay and guard the hive, those",
    "who are making the royal jelly and feeding it to the queen,",
    "those who form different parts of the great brain, must",
    "put down what it is they are doing and go off in search\u2014",
    "having no choice, not if the hive is going to survive,",
    "and where do they go, each one vanishing, never to be seen",
    "again, off wandering in the wilderness, having forgotten",
    "how, forgotten what it was they were after, what it was",
    "that gave meaning, having known it at one time, now",
    "a veil drawn. Is it that each one is a cell, a brain cell,",
    "and now they\u2019re failing one by one, plaque to Alzheimer\u2019s,",
    "or the way the cells in the esophagus will begin to mimic",
    "the stomach if the acid is too intense, if you\u2019re sleeping",
    "and the valve won\u2019t close, a lifetime of eating and drinking",
    "the wrong things, those cells compensating, trying",
    "their best, but opening the door to those other cells,",
    "the wild ones, the ones that call those bees, out there,",
    "somewhere, lost, having nowhere to return at night,",
    "their search for nectar fruitful, their small saddlebags full,",
    "but no one to go home to, no home, no memory of home,",
    "it\u2019s as if they\u2019d stumbled into some alternate world,",
    "one looking like ours but just a glass width different,",
    "just a fraction of sunlight different, the patient waking up,",
    "finding herself wandering, someone leading her back",
    "to bed, but there is no bed. Confusion of the hive,",
    "they call it, and the hive dies, each bee goes down,",
    "each light goes out, one by one, blinking out all over town,",
    "seen from a great height as the night ages, darkens,",
    "as you\u2019re parked in your car with your own true love,",
    "until it\u2019s just you two and the stars, until it\u2019s just you."
