    "To airmen crossing and communicant",
    "With orders of this field, no landing here",
    "But by the grace of God; no postulant",
    "Piloting earthward should abuse his fear:",
    "Trust in the instruments which fall their round,",
    "Tonight the only ceiling is the ground;",
    "Zero, from nothing into nothing made,",
    "Signifies all of altitude that stayed.",
    "Notice the fog that makes me all but blind;",
    "Here in the tower my skeleton will do",
    "To signal you. I am for all your kind",
    "Tonight\u2019s full complement and only crew.",
    "Airmen, I hope you read loud and clear;",
    "Your radios sound happy and sincere:",
    "Roger, you say, and dive for wreaths of holly",
    "Thinking the next voice heard will be as jolly.",
    "Suggest you take along the death\u2019s-head flag",
    "And hope that waving it will set you free.",
    "Judgment, like flights, may be a game of tag",
    "And you can shake and plead the Varsity.",
    "Say that team spirit was your only motive:",
    "You shot them up and did a locomotive.",
    "What if there is a temporary fetter?",
    "Christ understands. He also got his letter.",
    "I have you, heroes, holding each your course:",
    "You shot them up a little, and you grope",
    "Tonight with neither memory nor remorse;",
    "My skull is watching in the radarscope.",
    "I marvel as I track your sure downfall",
    "How you can navigate or fly at all",
    "For thinking of the tallies without log",
    "Until you make an error in this fog."
