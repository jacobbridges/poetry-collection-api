    "When bodies broken and all bodies seared",
    "Are counted up, uncrusted, tagged as feared,",
    "We know next day the scene will stand alone",
    "On pages white and mindless of the bone.",
    "Shall notice recognize beyond the burned,",
    "Or caption past the people tritely charred,",
    "Related dusty partness with the term",
    "Antiquity, the sense of death in stone",
    "And knowledge of the previously marred?",
    "On battlefields of Troy or Tuscany",
    "Or other places where techniques engaged,",
    "When warrior fell, or blade or boy enraged,",
    "Of them did campfire journalists of song",
    "Forget collective going, all but pathos,",
    "In wretchedness and fact of having gone?",
    "Accuse the gnostic grammar of old wars:",
    "It maims our grasp of accidental death",
    "Past putting down of papers to decry",
    "Their overlooking what it means to die."
