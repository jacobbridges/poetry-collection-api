    "To sing of Wars, of Captains, and of Kings,",
    "Of Cities founded, Common-wealths begun,",
    "For my mean Pen are too superior things;",
    "Or how they all, or each their dates have run,",
    "Let Poets and Historians set these forth.",
    "My obscure lines shall not so dim their worth.",
    "But when my wond\u2019ring eyes and envious heart",
    "Great Bartas\u2019 sugar\u2019d lines do but read o\u2019er,",
    "Fool, I do grudge the Muses did not part",
    "\u2018Twixt him and me that over-fluent store.",
    "A Bartas can do what a Bartas will",
    "But simple I according to my skill.",
    "From School-boy\u2019s tongue no Rhet\u2019ric we expect,",
    "Nor yet a sweet Consort from broken strings,",
    "Nor perfect beauty where\u2019s a main defect.",
    "My foolish, broken, blemished Muse so sings,",
    "And this to mend, alas, no Art is able,",
    "\u2018Cause Nature made it so irreparable.",
    "Nor can I, like that fluent sweet-tongued Greek",
    "Who lisp\u2019d at first, in future times speak plain.",
    "By Art he gladly found what he did seek,",
    "A full requital of his striving pain.",
    "Art can do much, but this maxim\u2019s most sure:",
    "A weak or wounded brain admits no cure.",
    "I am obnoxious to each carping tongue",
    "Who says my hand a needle better fits.",
    "A Poet\u2019s Pen all scorn I should thus wrong,",
    "For such despite they cast on female wits.",
    "If what I do prove well, it won\u2019t advance,",
    "They\u2019ll say it\u2019s stol\u2019n, or else it was by chance.",
    "But sure the antique Greeks were far more mild,",
    "Else of our Sex, why feigned they those nine",
    "And poesy made Calliope\u2019s own child?",
    "So \u2018mongst the rest they placed the Arts divine,",
    "But this weak knot they will full soon untie.",
    "The Greeks did nought but play the fools and lie.",
    "Let Greeks be Greeks, and Women what they are.",
    "Men have precedency and still excel;",
    "It is but vain unjustly to wage war.",
    "Men can do best, and Women know it well.",
    "Preeminence in all and each is yours;",
    "Yet grant some small acknowledgement of ours.",
    "And oh ye high flown quills that soar the skies,",
    "And ever with your prey still catch your praise,",
    "If e\u2019er you deign these lowly lines your eyes,",
    "Give thyme or Parsley wreath, I ask no Bays.",
    "This mean and unrefined ore of mine",
    "Will make your glist\u2019ring gold but more to shine."
