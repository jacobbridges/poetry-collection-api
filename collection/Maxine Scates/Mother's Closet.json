    "This is everything she ever closed a door",
    "on, the broom closet of childhood",
    "where no one could ever find a broom.",
    "Here, layer upon layer, nothing breathes:",
    "photo albums curl at the edges, books",
    "she brought home from the library",
    "where she worked, handled by thousands",
    "of other hands before their final exile",
    "where they\u2019ve waited, paper and more paper",
    "taking in the ocean air, about to sprout.",
    "Mother\u2019s sitting on the bed",
    "with her tattered list of dispersals\u2014who gets",
    "what among the treasures she hopes",
    "I\u2019ll find, but I know I\u2019m seeing",
    "what she doesn't want me to see,",
    "the daughter cleaning doing what the son",
    "would never do. After an hour of excavation",
    "the console TV emerges from beneath",
    "forgotten sweaters and balled up nylons",
    "saved for stuffing puppets, a long ago church project\u2014",
    "the TV arrived in 1966 same day I crushed",
    "the fender of the car, upsetting",
    "the careful plans she\u2019d made for payment.",
    "She wants to leave so much behind. Hours later",
    "I\u2019ve found nothing I want but the purple mache mask",
    "I made in the fourth grade. I like its yellow eyes.",
    "She looks at each magazine I remove, saving",
    "every word about my brother, the coach. He\u2019s sixty",
    "and a long dead mouse has eaten the laces",
    "of his baby shoes. I want order. I say",
    "I\u2019m old myself, I\u2019ve started throwing things away.",
    "I\u2019m lying. I\u2019ve kept everything she\u2019s ever given me."
