    "Last time I fell in a shower room",
    "I bled like a tumbril dandy",
    "and the hotel longed to be rid of me.",
    "Taken to the town clinic, I",
    "described how I tripped on a steel rim",
    "and found my head in the wardrobe.",
    "Scalp-sewn and knotted and flagged",
    "I thanked the Frau Doktor and fled,",
    "wishing the grab-bar of age might",
    "be bolted to all civilization",
    "and thinking of Rome\u2019s eighth hill",
    "heaped up out of broken amphorae.",
    "When, anytime after sixty,",
    "or anytime before, you stumble",
    "over two stairs and club your forehead",
    "on rake or hoe, bricks or fuel-drums,",
    "that\u2019s the time to call the purveyor",
    "of steel pipe and indoor railings,",
    "and soon you\u2019ll be grasping up landings",
    "having left your balance in the car",
    "from which please God you\u2019ll never",
    "see the launchway of tires off a brink.",
    "Later comes the sunny day when",
    "street detail whitens blindly to mauve",
    "and people hurry you, or wait, quiet."
