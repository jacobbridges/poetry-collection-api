    "Such a long time as the wave idling gathers",
    "lofts and presses forward into the curvature",
    "of the height before one realizes that the",
    "tension completes itself with a fall through air,",
    "disorganization the prelude to the meandering",
    "of another gather and hurl, the necessary:",
    "ah, what can one make to absorb the astonishment:",
    "you should have seen me the merchant at market",
    "this morning: the people ogled me with severe",
    "goggles: maids, buying in manners and measures",
    "beyond themselves, stared into my goods and",
    "then grew horror-eyed: wives still as distant",
    "from day as a carrot from dinner took the",
    "misconnection sagely, a usual patience:",
    "peashells, I said, long silky peashells: cobs,",
    "I said, long cobs: husks and shucks, I said:",
    "one concerned person pointed out that my whole",
    "economy was wrong; yes, I said, but I have",
    "nothing else to sell: and I said to her, won't",
    "you appreciate the silky beds where seeds",
    "have lain: she had not come to that: and",
    "how about this residence all the grains have",
    "left: won't you buy it and think about it:",
    "not for dinner, she said: rinds, I cried,",
    "rinds and peelings: there was some interest",
    "in those, as for a marmalade, but no one willing,",
    "finally, to do the preparations: absurd, one",
    "woman shouted, and then I grew serious: can you",
    "do with that: but she was off before we fully",
    "met: you should have seen me the merchant at",
    "market this morning: will bankruptcy make a",
    "go of it: will the leavings be left only: the",
    "wave turns over and does not rise again, that wave."
