    "Coming to Sumer and the tamarisks on the river",
    "I Ezra with unsettling love",
    "rifled the mud and wattle huts",
    "for recent mournings",
    "with gold leaves",
    "and lapis lazuli beads",
    "in the neat braids loosening from the skull",
    "Looking through the wattles to the sun",
    "I said",
    "It has rained some here in this place",
    "unless snow falls heavily in the hills",
    "to do this",
    "The floor was smooth with silt",
    "and river weeds hanging gray",
    "on the bent reeds spoke saying",
    "Everything is even here as you can see",
    "Firing the huts",
    "I abandoned the unprofitable poor",
    "unequal even in the bone",
    "to disrespect",
    "and casual with certainty",
    "watched an eagle wing as I went",
    "to king and priest"
