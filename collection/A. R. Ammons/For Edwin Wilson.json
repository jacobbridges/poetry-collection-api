    "Did wind and wave design the albatross's wing,",
    "honed compliances: or is it effrontery to",
    "suggest that the wing designed the gales and",
    "seas: are we guests here, then, with all the",
    "gratitude and soft-walking of the guest:",
    "provisions and endurances of riverbeds,",
    "mountain shoulders, windings through of tulip",
    "poplar, grass, and sweet-frosted foxgrape:",
    "are we to come into these and leave them as",
    "they are: are the rivers in us, and the slopes,",
    "ours that the world's imitate, or are we",
    "mirrorments merely of a high designing aloof",
    "and generous as a host to us: what would",
    "become of us if we declined and staked out",
    "a level affirmation of our own: we wind",
    "the brook into our settlement and husband the",
    "wind to our sails and blades: what is to",
    "be grateful when let alone to itself, as for",
    "a holiday in naturalness: the albatross, ah,",
    "fishes the waves with a will beyond the",
    "waves' will, and we, to our own doings, put",
    "down the rising of sea or mountain slope: except",
    "we do not finally put it down: still, till",
    "the host appears, we'll make the masters here."
