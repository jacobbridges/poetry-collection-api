    "I don\u2019t know somehow it seems sufficient",
    "to see and hear whatever coming and going is,",
    "losing the self to the victory",
    "of stones and trees,",
    "of bending sandpit lakes, crescent",
    "round groves of dwarf pine:",
    "for it is not so much to know the self",
    "as to know it as it is known",
    "by galaxy and cedar cone,",
    "as if birth had never found it",
    "and death could never end it:",
    "the swamp\u2019s slow water comes",
    "down Gravelly Run fanning the long",
    "stone-held algal",
    "hair and narrowing roils between",
    "the shoulders of the highway bridge:",
    "holly grows on the banks in the woods there,",
    "and the cedars\u2019 gothic-clustered",
    "spires could make",
    "green religion in winter bones:",
    "so I look and reflect, but the air\u2019s glass",
    "jail seals each thing in its entity:",
    "no use to make any philosophies here:",
    "I see no",
    "god in the holly, hear no song from",
    "the snowbroken weeds: Hegel is not the winter",
    "yellow in the pines: the sunlight has never",
    "heard of trees: surrendered self among",
    "unwelcoming forms: stranger,",
    "hoist your burdens, get on down the road."
