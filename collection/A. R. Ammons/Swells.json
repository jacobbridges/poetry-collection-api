    "The very longest swell in the ocean, I suspect,",
    "carries the deepest memory, the information of actions",
    "summarized (surface peaks and dibbles and local sharp",
    "slopes of windstorms) with a summary of the summaries",
    "and under other summaries a deeper summary: well, maybe",
    "deeper, longer for length here is the same as deep",
    "time: so that the longest swell swells least; that",
    "is, its effects in immediate events are least perceptible,",
    "a pitch to white water rising say a millimeter more",
    "because of an old invisible presence: and on the ocean",
    "floor an average so vast occurs it moves in a noticeability",
    "of a thousand years, every blip, though, of surface and",
    "intermediacy moderated into account: I like to go",
    "to old places where the effect dwells, summits or seas",
    "so hard to summon into mind, even with the natural",
    "ones hard to climb or weigh: I go there in my mind",
    "(which is, after all, where these things negotiably are)",
    "and tune in to the wave nearly beyond rise or fall in its",
    "staying and hum the constant, universal assimilation: the",
    "information, so packed, nearly silenced with majesty",
    "and communicating hardly any action: go there and",
    "rest from the ragged and rapid pulse, the immediate threat",
    "shot up in a disintegrating spray, the many thoughts and",
    "sights unmanageable, the deaths of so many, hungry or mad."
