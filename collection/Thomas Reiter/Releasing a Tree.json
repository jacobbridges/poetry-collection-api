    "Softly pummeled overnight, the lower",
    "limbs of our Norway spruce",
    "flexed and the deepening snow held them.",
    "Windless sunlight now, so I go out",
    "wearing hip waders and carrying",
    "not a fly rod but a garden hoe. I begin",
    "worrying the snow for the holdfast",
    "of a branch that\u2019s so far down",
    "a wren\u2019s nest floats above it like a buoy.",
    "I work the hoe, not chopping but cradling,",
    "then pull straight up. A current of air",
    "as the needles loft their burden",
    "over my head. Those grace notes",
    "of the snowfall, crystals giving off",
    "copper, green, rose\u2014watching them",
    "I stumble over a branch, go down",
    "and my gloves fill with snow. Ah, I find",
    "my father here: I remember as a child",
    "how flames touched my hand the time",
    "I added wood to the stove in our ice-fishing",
    "shanty, how he plunged that hand",
    "through the hole into the river, teaching me",
    "one kind of burning can ease another.",
    "The branch bobs then tapers into place",
    "and composes itself, looking",
    "unchanged though all summer",
    "it will bring up this day from underfoot."
