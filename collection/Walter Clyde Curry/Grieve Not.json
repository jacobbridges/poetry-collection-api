    "Grieve not that winter masks the yet quick earth,",
    "Nor still that summer walks the hills no more;",
    "That fickle spring has doffed the plaid she wore",
    "To swathe herself in napkins till rebirth.",
    "These buddings, flowerings, are nothing worth;",
    "This ermine cloud stretched firm across the lakes",
    "Will presently be shattered into flakes;",
    "Then, starveling world, be subject to my mirth.",
    "I know that faithful swift mortality",
    "Subscribes to nothing longer than a day;",
    "All beauty signals imminent decay;",
    "And painted wreckage cumbers land and sea.",
    "I laugh to hear a sniveling wise one say,",
    "\u201cSome winnowed self escapes this reckless way.\u201d"
