    "Sewn straw, exact pattern. Fields of rice-sprigs",
    "evenly set, a mile of herringbone tweed.",

    "coverlets, comforters, towels: flown nests. Imprint",
    "of bodies, fading. They fold the beds away,",
    "the room waits empty all day.",
    "All day the bodies",
    "circle, leaving no impression on each",
    "other. Tooled in the foundry of the streets.",
    "School-caps, factory-packed subway, miracle train:",
    "one territorial imperative,",
    "an emperor\u2019s.",
    "On his platform one yard square",
    "perched on a roof that slopes in waves of tiles",
    "up toward other tiled cascades, the karate student",
    "for hours does running in place, deep knee bends",
    "on his surfboard perch. All his free time to make",
    "his body efficient, tight, exact, rising",
    "and falling, mint piston pumping in its shaft."
