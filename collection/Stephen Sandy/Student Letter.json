    "Hence you must teach me",
    "where you got the news or what sort of book",
    "gave you the fact that quite few people knows.",
    "To know the fact of our nation\u2019s subjection",
    "is not so comfortable",
    "but the fact of many people\u2019s spontaneous death",

    "which was given by the beamed materials",
    "in the memorial hall.",
    "But most youth after the war",
    "are indifferent to those",
    "nightmares",
    "because of our no experience. Surely,",

    "to the rebombing",
    "at any place",
    "in this world.",
    "In conclusion I may say that most people",

    "Please share your experience of the war with me.",

    "I can suspect more seriously.",
    "You have abandoned such cursed things as useless?",
    "In that war 3 million people were killed",
    "on the side of our nation, especially",
    "three hundred thousand people by the A-bomb.",
    "Over the war between the imperialism",
