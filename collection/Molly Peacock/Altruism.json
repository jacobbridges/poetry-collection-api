    "What if we got outside ourselves and there",
    "really was an outside out there, not just",
    "our insides turned inside out? What if there",
    "really were a you beyond me, not just",
    "the waves off my own fire, like those waves off",
    "the backyard grill you can see the next yard through,",
    "though not well -- just enough to know that off",
    "to the right belongs to someone else, not you.",
    "What if, when we said I love you, there were",
    "a you to love as there is a yard beyond",
    "to walk past the grill and get to? To endure",
    "the endless walk through the self, knowing through a bond",
    "that has no basis (for ourselves are all we know)",
    "is altruism: not giving, but coming to know",
    "someone is there through the wavy vision",
    "of the self's heat, love become a decision."
