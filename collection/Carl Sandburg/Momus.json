    "Momus is the name men give your face,",
    "The brag of its tone, like a long low steamboat whistle",
    "Finding a way mid mist on a shoreland,",
    "Where gray rocks let the salt water shatter spray Against horizons purple, silent.",
    "Yes, Momus,",
    "Men have flung your face in bronze",
    "To gaze in gargoyle downward on a street-whirl of folk.",
    "They were artists did this, shaped your sad mouth,",
    "Gave you a tall forehead slanted with calm, broad wisdom;",
    "All your lips to the corners and your cheeks to the high bones",
    "Thrown over and through with a smile that forever wishes and wishes, purple, silent, fled from all the iron things of life, evaded like a sought bandit, gone into dreams, by God.",
    "I wonder, Momus,",
    "Whether shadows of the dead sit somewhere and look with deep laughter",
    "On men who play in terrible earnest the old, known, solemn repetitions of history.",
    "A droning monotone soft as sea laughter hovers from your kindliness of bronze,",
    "You give me the human ease of a mountain peak, purple, silent;",
    "Granite shoulders heaving above the earth curves,",
    "Careless eye-witness of the spawning tides of men and women",
    "Swarming always in a drift of millions to the dust of toil, the salt of tears,",
    "And blood drops of undiminishing war."
