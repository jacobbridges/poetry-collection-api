    "A man talking to his ex-wife on the phone.",
    "He has loved her voice and listens with attention",
    "to every modulation of its tone. Knowing",
    "it intimately. Not knowing what he wants",
    "from the sound of it, from the tendered civility.",
    "He studies, out the window, the seed shapes",
    "of the broken pods of ornamental trees.",
    "The kind that grow in everyone\u2019s garden, that no one",
    "but horticulturists can name. Four arched chambers",
    "of pale green, tiny vegetal proscenium arches,",
    "a pair of black tapering seeds bedded in each chamber.",
    "A wish geometry, miniature, Indian or Persian,",
    "lovers or gods in their apartments. Outside, white,",
    "patient animals, and tangled vines, and rain."
