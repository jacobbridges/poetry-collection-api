    "When the earth is turned in spring",
    "The worms are fat as anything.",
    "And birds come flying all around",
    "To eat the worms right off the ground.",
    "They like the worms just as much as I",
    "Like bread and milk and apple pie.",
    "And once, when I was very young,",
    "I put a worm right on my tongue.",
    "I didn't like the taste a bit,",
    "And so I didn't swallow it.",
    "But oh, it makes my Mother squirm",
    "Because she",
    "I ate that worm!"
