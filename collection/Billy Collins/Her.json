    "There is no noisier place than the suburbs,",
    "someone once said to me",
    "as we were walking along a fairway,",
    "and every day is delighted to offer fresh evidence:",
    "the chainsaw, the leaf-blower blowing",
    "one leaf around an enormous house with columns,",
    "on Mondays and Thursdays the garbage truck",
    "equipped with air brakes, reverse beeper, and merciless grinder.",
    "There\u2019s dogs, hammers, backhoes",
    "or serious earthmovers if today is not your day.",
    "How can the birds get a peep",
    "or a chirp in edgewise, I would like to know?",
    "But this morning is different,",
    "only a soft clicking sound",
    "and the low talk of two workmen working",
    "on the house next door, laying tile I am guessing.",
    "Otherwise, all quiet for a change,",
    "just the clicking of tiles being handled",
    "and their talking back and forth in Spanish",
    "then one of them asking in English",
    "\u201cWhat was her name?\u201d and the silence of the other."
