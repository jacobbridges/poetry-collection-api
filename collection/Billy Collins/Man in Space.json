    "All you have to do is listen to the way a man",
    "sometimes talks to his wife at a table of people",
    "and notice how intent he is on making his point",
    "even though her lower lip is beginning to quiver,",
    "and you will know why the women in science",
    "fiction movies who inhabit a planet of their own",
    "are not pictured making a salad or reading a magazine",
    "when the men from earth arrive in their rocket,",
    "why they are always standing in a semicircle",
    "with their arms folded, their bare legs set apart,",
    "their breasts protected by hard metal disks."
