    "That morning under a pale hood of sky",
    "I heard the unambiguous scrape of spackling",
    "against the side of our wickered, penitential house.",
    "The day mirled and clabbered",
    "in the thick, stony light,",
    "and the rooks\u2019 feathered narling",
    "astounded the salt waves, the plush coast.",
    "I lugged a bucket past the forked",
    "coercion of a tree, up toward",
    "the pious and nictitating preeminence of a school,",
    "hunkered there in its gully of learning.",
    "Only later, by the galvanized washstand,",
    "while gaunt, phosphorescent heifers",
    "swam beyond the windows,",
    "did the whorled and sparky gib of the indefinite",
    "wobble me into knowledge.",
    "Then, I heard the ghost-clink of milk bottle",
    "on the rough threshold",
    "and understood the meadow-bells",
    "that trembled over a nimbus of ragwort\u2014",
    "the whole afternoon lambent, corrugated, puddle-mad."
