    "To the young and able man who lets his death come in",
    "with veils in his face that say you can come in and claim",
    "a place among us. To the young man who closes his eyes",
    "to the parting of clouds and lets what is beyond come in.",
    "To the young man whose body is still warm, that weightless",
    "being with halos, whose footsteps we will never fill. To the endless",
    "clock machine in the god body of the young man who",
    "closes his eyes as the light sweeps him to eternity. To the blessed",
    "beating of his heart when we listen to our closed palms.",
    "To the complex latticework of smiles in his photographs",
    "every two seconds you pick him up and back. God body love.",
    "Good-bye. To the young man whose laughter is now a memorial among us,",
    "as we sit under tents, listen to our mothers and sisters cry,",
    "shed our own not-so-private god tears love, shelter under",
    "the night that claimed him. To him and beyond and the endless",
    "love through which God privately loves him."
