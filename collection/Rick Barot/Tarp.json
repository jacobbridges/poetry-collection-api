    "I have seen the black sheets laid out like carpets",
    "under the trees, catching the rain",
    "of olives as they fell. Also the cerulean brightness",
    "of the one covering the bad roof",
    "of a neighbor\u2019s shed, the color the only color",
    "inside the winter\u2019s weeks. Another one",
    "took the shape of the pile of bricks underneath.",
    "Another flew off the back of a truck,",
    "black as a piano if a piano could rise into the air.",
    "I have seen the ones under bridges,",
    "the forms they make of sleep. I could go on",
    "this way until the end of the page, even though",
    "what I have in my mind isn\u2019t the thing",
    "itself, but the category of belief that sees the thing",
    "as a shelter for what is beneath it.",
    "There is no shelter. You cannot put a tarp over",
    "a wave. You cannot put a tarp",
    "over a war. You cannot put a tarp over the broken",
    "oil well miles under the ocean.",
    "There is no tarp for that raging figure in the mind",
    "that sits in a corner and shreds receipts",
    "and newspapers. There is no tarp for dread,",
    "whose only recourse is language",
    "so approximate it hardly means what it means:",
    "He is not here. She is sick. She cannot remember",
    "her name. He is old. He is ashamed."
