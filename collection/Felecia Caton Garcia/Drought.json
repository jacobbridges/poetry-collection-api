    "Try to remember: things go wrong in spite of it all.",
    "I listen to our daughters singing in the crackling rows",
    "of corn and wonder why I don't love them more.",
    "They move like dark birds, small mouths open",
    "to the sky and hungry. All afternoon I listen",
    "to the highway and watch clouds push down over the hills.",
    "I remember your legs, heavy with sleep, lying across mine.",
    "I remember when the world was transparent, trembling, all",
    "shattering light. I had to grit my teeth against its brilliance.",
    "It was nothing like this stillness that makes it difficult",
    "to lift my eyes. When I finally do, I see you",
    "carrying the girls over the sharp stones of the creek bed.",
    "When they pull at my clothes and lean against my arms,",
    "I don't know what to do and do nothing."
