    "In vain thou bid\u2019st me strike the lyre,",
    "And sing a song of mirth and glee,",
    "Or, kindling with poetic fire,",
    "Attempt some higher minstrelsy;",
    "In vain, in vain! for every thought",
    "That issues from this throbbing brain,",
    "Is from its first conception fraught",
    "With gloom and darkness, woe and pain.",
    "From earliest youth my path has been",
    "Cast in life\u2019s darkest, deepest shade,",
    "Where no bright ray did intervene,",
    "Nor e\u2019er a passing sunbeam strayed;",
    "But all was dark and cheerless night,",
    "Without one ray of hopeful light.",
    "From childhood, then, through many a shock,",
    "I\u2019ve battled with the ills of life,",
    "Till, like a rude and rugged rock,",
    "My heart grew callous in the strife.",
    "When other children passed the hours",
    "In mirth, and play, and childish glee,",
    "Or gathering the summer flowers",
    "By gentle brook, or flowery lea,",
    "I sought the wild and rugged glen",
    "Where Nature, in her sternest mood,",
    "Far from the busy haunts of men,",
    "Frowned in the darksome solitude.",
    "There have I mused till gloomy night,",
    "Like the death-angel\u2019s brooding wing,",
    "Would shut out every thing from sight,",
    "And o\u2019er the scene her mantle fling;",
    "And seeking then my lonely bed",
    "To pass the night in sweet repose,",
    "Around my fevered, burning head,",
    "Dark visions of the night arose;",
    "And the stern scenes which day had viewed",
    "In sterner aspect rose before me,",
    "And specters of still sterner mood",
    "Waved their menacing fingers o\u2019er me.",
    "When the dark storm-fiend soared abroad,",
    "And swept to earth the waving grain,",
    "On whirlwind through the forest rode,",
    "And stirred to foam the heaving main,",
    "I loved to mark the lightning\u2019s flash,",
    "And listen to the ocean\u2019s roar,",
    "Or hear the pealing thunder\u2019s crash,",
    "And see the mountain torrents pour",
    "Down precipices dark and steep,",
    "Still bearing, in their headlong course",
    "To meet th\u2019 embrace of ocean deep,",
    "Mementoes of the tempest\u2019s force;",
    "For fire and tempest, flood and storm,",
    "Wakened deep echoes in my soul,",
    "And made the quickening life-blood warm",
    "With impulse that knew no control;",
    "And the fierce lightning\u2019s lurid flash",
    "Rending the somber clouds asunder,",
    "Followed by the terrific crash",
    "Which marks the hoarsely rattling thunder,",
    "Seemed like the gleams of lurid light",
    "Which flashed across my seething brain,",
    "Succeeded by a darker night,",
    "With wilder horrors in its train.",
    "And I have stood on ocean\u2019s shore,",
    "And viewed its dreary waters roll,",
    "Till the dull music of its roar",
    "Called forth responses in my soul;",
    "And I have felt that there was traced",
    "An image of my inmost soul,",
    "In that dark, dreary, boundless waste,",
    "Whose sluggish waters aimless roll\u2014",
    "Save when aroused by storms\u2019 wild force",
    "It lifts on high its angry wave,",
    "And thousands driven from their course",
    "Find in its depths a nameless grave.",
    "Whene\u2019er I turned in gentler mood",
    "To scan the old historic page,",
    "It was not where the wise and good,",
    "The Bard, the Statesman, or the Sage,",
    "Had drawn in lines of living light,",
    "Lessons of virtue, truth and right;",
    "But that which told of secret league,",
    "Where deep conspiracies were rife,",
    "And where, through foul and dark intrigue,",
    "Were sowed the seeds of deadly strife.",
    "Where hostile armies met to seal",
    "Their country\u2019s doom, for woe or weal;",
    "Where the grim-visaged death-fiend drank",
    "His full supply of human gore,",
    "And poured through every hostile rank",
    "The tide of battle\u2019s awful roar;",
    "For then my spirit seemed to soar",
    "Away to where such scenes were rife,",
    "And high above the battle\u2019s roar",
    "Sit as spectator of the strife\u2014",
    "And in those scenes of war and woe,",
    "A fierce and fitful pleasure know.",
    "There was a time when I possessed",
    "High notions of Religion\u2019s claim,",
    "Nor deemed its practice, at the best,",
    "Was but a false and empty name;",
    "But when I saw the graceless deeds",
    "Which marked its strongest votaries\u2019 path,",
    "How senseless bigots, o\u2019er their creeds,",
    "Blazing with wild fanatic wrath,",
    "Let loose the deadly tide of war,",
    "Spread devastation near and far,",
    "Through scenes of rapine, blood and shame,",
    "Of cities sacked, and towns on flame,",
    "Caused unbelievers\u2019 hearts to feel",
    "The arguments of fire and steel",
    "By which they sought t\u2019 enforce the word,",
    "And make rebellious hearts approve",
    "Those arguments of fire and sword",
    "As mandates of the God of love\u2014",
    "How could I think that such a faith,",
    "Whose path was marked by fire and blood,",
    "That sowed the seeds of war and death,",
    "Had issued from a holy God?",
    "There was a time when I did love,",
    "Such love as those alone can know,",
    "Whose blood like burning lava moves,",
    "Whose passions like the lightning glow;",
    "And when that ardent, truthful love,",
    "Was blighted in its opening bloom,",
    "And all around, below, above,",
    "Seemed like the darkness of the tomb,",
    "\u2019Twas then my stern and callous heart,",
    "Riven in its most vital part,",
    "Seemed like some gnarled and knotted oak,",
    "That, shivered by the lightning\u2019s stroke,",
    "Stands in the lonely wanderer\u2019s path,",
    "A ghastly monument of wrath.",
    "Then how can I attune the lyre",
    "To strains of love, or joyous glee?",
    "Break forth in patriotic fire,",
    "Or soar on higher minstrelsy,",
    "To sing the praise of virtue bright,",
    "Condemn the wrong, and laud the right;",
    "When neither vice nor guilt can fling",
    "A darker shadow o\u2019er my breast,",
    "Not even Virtue\u2019s self can bring,",
    "Unto my moody spirit, rest.",
    "It may not be, it cannot be!",
    "Let others strike the sounding string,",
    "And in rich strains of harmony,",
    "Songs of poetic beauty sing;",
    "But mine must still the portion be,",
    "However dark and drear the doom,",
    "To live estranged from sympathy,",
    "Buried in doubt, despair and gloom;",
    "To bare my breast to every blow,",
    "To know no friend, and fear no foe,",
    "Each generous impulse trod to dust,",
    "Each noble aspiration crushed,",
    "Each feeling struck with withering blight,",
    "With no regard for wrong or right,",
    "No fear of hell, no hope of heaven,",
    "Die all unwept and unforgiven,",
    "Content to know and dare the worst",
    "Which mankind\u2019s hate, and heaven\u2019s curse,",
    "Can heap upon my living head,",
    "Or cast around my memory dead;",
    "And let them on my tombstone trace,",
    "Here lies the Pariah of his race."
