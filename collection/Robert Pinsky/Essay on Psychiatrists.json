    "Moreover, they are for more than one reason",
    "Difficult to speak of seriously and freely,",

    "In boots and a knit dress, or the man",
    "Seen buying the Sunday Times in mutton-chop",
    "Whiskers and expensive running shoes.",
    "In a way I suspect that even the terms \u201cdoctor\u201d",
    "And \u201ctherapist\u201d are misnomers; the patient",
    "Is not necessarily \u201csick.\u201d And one assumes",
    "That no small part of the psychiatrist\u2019s",
    "Role is just that: to point out misnomers.",
    "These are the first citizens of contingency.",
    "Far from the doctrinaire past of the old ones,",
    "They think in their prudent meditations",
    "Not about ecstasy (the soul leaving the body)",
    "Nor enthusiasm (the god entering one\u2019s person)",
    "Nor even about sanity (which means",
    "Health, an impossible perfection)",
    "But ponder instead relative truth and the warm",
    "Dusk of amelioration. The cautious",
    "Young augurs with their family-life, good books",
    "And records and foreign cars believe",
    "In amelioration\u2014in that, and in suffering.",
    "Yes, crazy to suppose one could describe them\u2014",
    "And yet, there was this incident: at the local beach",
    "Clouds of professors and the husbands of professors",
    "Swam, dabbled, or stood to talk with arms folded",
    "Gazing at the lake ... and one of the few townsfolk there,",
    "With no faculty status\u2014a matter-of-fact, competent,",
    "Catholic woman of twenty-seven with five children",
    "And a first-rate body\u2014pointed her finger",
    "At the back of one certain man and asked me,",

    "Middle-class bathing suit and sandy sideburns, to me",
    "He looked from the back like one more professor.",
    "And from the front, too\u2014the boyish, unformed carriage",
    "Which foreigners always note in American men, combined",
    "As in a professor with that liberal, quizzical,",
    "Articulate gaze so unlike the more focused, more",
    "Tolerant expression worn by a man of action (surgeon,",

    "At their best, be serious. But however profound",
    "The psychiatrists may be, they are not serious the way",
    "A painter may be serious beyond pictures, or a businessman",
    "May be serious beyond property and cash\u2014or even",
    "The way scholars and surgeons are serious, each rapt",
    "In his work\u2019s final cause, contingent upon nothing:",
    "Beyond work; persons; recoveries. And this is fitting:",
    "Who would want to fly with a pilot who was",
    "About getting to the destination safely? Terrifying idea\u2014",
    "That a pilot could over-extend, perhaps try to fly",
    "Too well, or suffer from Pilot\u2019s Block; of course,",
    "It may be that (just as they must not drink liquor",

    "With a psychiatrist, to prevent such things from happening.",
    "Madness itself, as an idea, leaves us confused\u2014",
    "Incredulous that it exists, or cruelly facetious,",
    "Or stricken with a superstitious awe as if bound",
    "By the lost cults of Trebizond and Pergamum ...",
    "The most profound study of madness is found",
    "In the",
    "of Euripides, so deeply disturbing",
    "That in Cambridge, Massachusetts the players",
    "Evaded some of the strongest unsettling material",
    "By portraying poor sincere, fuddled, decent Pentheus",

    "Tears her terrified son\u2019s arm from his body, or bears",
    "His head on her spear, she remains happy so long",

    "Among the Bacchantes nestled gazelles",
    "And young wolves in their arms, and suckled them;",
    "You might see a single one of them tear a fat calf",
    "In two, still bellowing with fright, while others",
    "Clawed heifers to pieces; ribs and hooves",
    "Were strewn everywhere; blood-smeared scraps",
    "Hung from the fir trees; furious bulls",
    "Charged and then fell stumbling, pulled down",
    "To be stripped of skin and flesh by screaming women ...",
    "And Pentheus listened. Flames burned in their hair,",
    "Unnoticed; thick honey spurted from their wands;",
    "And the snakes they wore like ribbons licked",
    "Hot blood from their flushed necks: Pentheus",
    "Was the man the people told ... \u201cweird things,\u201d like",

    "Trying to carouse, it is Pentheus\u2014down-to-earth,",
    "Sober\u2014who raises his voice in the name of dignity.",
    "Being a psychiatrist, how could he attend to the Chorus\u2019s warning",
    "Against \u201cthose who aspire\u201d and \u201ca tongue without reins\u201d?",
    "In a more hostile view, the psychiatrists",
    "Are like Bacchus\u2014the knowing smirk of his mask,",

    "And even his little jokes, as when the great palace",
    "Is hit by lightning which blazes and stays,",
    "Bouncing among the crumpled stone walls ...",
    "And through the burning rubble he comes,",
    "With his soft ways picking along lightly",
    "With a calm smile for the trembling Chorus",
    "Who have fallen to the ground, bowing",
    "In the un-Greek, Eastern way\u2014What, Asian women,",
    "He asks, Were you disturbed just now when Bacchus",
    "Jostled the palace? He warns Pentheus to adjust,",
    "To learn the ordinary man\u2019s humble sense of limits,",
    "Violent limits, to the rational world. He cures",
    "Pentheus of the grand delusion that the dark",
    "Urgencies can be governed simply by the mind,",

    "Often are similarly hoked-up, dutiful, vulgar. After all,",

    "In far greater numbers than other people.",
    "Symmetry suggests one myth, or significance: the drinking",
    "Of writers coming from too much concentration,",

    "For or even about possibly indifferent people, people",
