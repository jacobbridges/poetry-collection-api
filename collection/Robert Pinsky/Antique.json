    "I drowned in the fire of having you, I burned",
    "In the river of not having you, we lived",
    "Together for hours in a house of a thousand rooms",
    "And we were parted for a thousand years.",
    "Ten minutes ago we raised our children who cover",
    "The earth and have forgotten that we existed.",
    "It was not maya, it was not a ladder to perfection,",
    "It was this cold sunlight falling on this warm earth.",
    "When I turned you went to Hell. When your ship",
    "Fled the battle I followed you and lost the world",
    "Without regret but with stormy recriminations.",
    "Someday far down that corridor of horror the future",
    "Someone who buys this picture of you for the frame",
    "At a stall in a dwindled city will study your face",
    "And decide to harbor it for a little while longer",
    "From the waters of anonymity, the acids of breath."
