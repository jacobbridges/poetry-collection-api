    "Trees in the old days used to stand",
    "And shape a shady lane",
    "Where lovers wandered hand in hand",
    "Who came from Carentan.",
    "This was the shining green canal",
    "Where we came two by two",
    "Walking at combat-interval.",
    "Such trees we never knew.",
    "The day was early June, the ground",
    "Was soft and bright with dew.",
    "Far away the guns did sound,",
    "But here the sky was blue.",
    "The sky was blue, but there a smoke",
    "Hung still above the sea",
    "Where the ships together spoke",
    "To towns we could not see.",
    "Could you have seen us through a glass",
    "You would have said a walk",
    "Of farmers out to turn the grass,",
    "Each with his own hay-fork.",
    "The watchers in their leopard suits",
    "Waited till it was time,",
    "And aimed between the belt and boot",
    "And let the barrel climb.",
    "I must lie down at once, there is",
    "A hammer at my knee.",
    "And call it death or cowardice,",
    "Don\u2019t count again on me.",
    "Everything\u2019s all right, Mother,",
    "Everyone gets the same",
    "At one time or another.",
    "It\u2019s all in the game.",
    "I never strolled, nor ever shall,",
    "Down such a leafy lane.",
    "I never drank in a canal,",
    "Nor ever shall again.",
    "There is a whistling in the leaves",
    "And it is not the wind,",
    "The twigs are falling from the knives",
    "That cut men to the ground.",
    "Tell me, Master-Sergeant,",
    "The way to turn and shoot.",
    "But the Sergeant\u2019s silent",
    "That taught me how to do it.",
    "O Captain, show us quickly",
    "Our place upon the map.",
    "But the Captain\u2019s sickly",
    "And taking a long nap.",
    "Lieutenant, what\u2019s my duty,",
    "My place in the platoon?",
    "He too\u2019s a sleeping beauty,",
    "Charmed by that strange tune.",
    "Carentan O Carentan",
    "Before we met with you",
    "We never yet had lost a man",
    "Or known what death could do."
