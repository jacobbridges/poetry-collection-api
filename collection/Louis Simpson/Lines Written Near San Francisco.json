    "I wake and feel the city trembling.",
    "Yes, there is something unsettled in the air",
    "And the earth is uncertain.",
    "And so it was for the tenor Caruso.",
    "He couldn\u2019t sleep\u2014you know how the ovation",
    "Rings in your ears, and you re-sing your part.",
    "And then the ceiling trembled",
    "And the floor moved. He ran into the street.",
    "Never had Naples given him such a reception!",
    "The air was darker than Vesuvius.",
    "\u201c",
    ",\u201d",
    "He cried, \u201cI\u2019ve lost my voice!\u201d",
    "At that moment the hideous voice of Culture,",
    "Hysterical woman, thrashing her arms and legs,",
    "Shrieked from the ruins.",
    "At that moment everyone became a performer.",
    "Otello and Don Giovanni",
    "And Figaro strode on the midmost stage.",
    "In the high window of a burning castle",
    "Lucia raved. Black horses",
    "Plunged through fire, dragging the wild bells.",
    "The curtains were wrapped in smoke. Tin swords",
    "Were melting; masks and ruffs",
    "Burned\u2014and the costumes of the peasants\u2019 chorus.",
    "Night fell. The white moon rose",
    "And sank in the Pacific. The tremors",
    "Passed under the waves. And Death rested.",
    "2",
    "Now, as we stand idle,",
    "Watching the silent, bowler-hatted man,",
    "The engineer, who writes in the smoking field;",
    "Now as he hands the paper to a boy,",
    "Who takes it and runs to a group of waiting men,",
    "And they disperse and move toward their wagons,",
    "Mules bray and the wagons move\u2014",
    "Wait! Before you start",
    "(Already the wheels are rattling on the stones)",
    "Say, did your fathers cross the dry Sierras",
    "To build another London?",
    "Do Americans always have to be second-rate?",
    "Wait! For there are spirits",
    "In the earth itself, or the air, or sea.",
    "Where are the aboriginal American devils?",
    "Cloud shadows, pine shadows",
    "Falling across the bright Pacific bay ...",
    "(Already they have nailed rough boards together)",
    "Wait only for the wind",
    "That rustles in the eucalyptus tree.",
    "Wait only for the light",
    "That trembles on the petals of a rose.",
    "(The mortar sets\u2014banks are the first to stand)",
    "Wait for a rose, and you may wait forever.",
    "The silent man mops his head and drinks",
    "Cold lemonade. \u201cSan Francisco",
    "Is a city second only to Paris.\u201d",
    "3",
    "Every night, at the end of America",
    "We taste our wine, looking at the Pacific.",
    "How sad it is, the end of America!",
    "While we were waiting for the land",
    "They\u2019d finished it\u2014with gas drums",
    "On the hilltops, cheap housing in the valleys",
    "Where lives are mean and wretched.",
    "But the banks thrive and the realtors",
    "Rejoice\u2014they have their America.",
    "Still, there is something unsettled in the air.",
    "Out there on the Pacific",
    "There\u2019s no America but the Marines.",
    "Whitman was wrong about the People,",
    "But right about himself. The land is within.",
    "At the end of the open road we come to ourselves.",
    "Though mad Columbus follows the sun",
    "Into the sea, we cannot follow.",
    "We must remain, to serve the returning sun,",
    "And to set tables for death.",
    "For we are the colonists of Death\u2014",
    "Not, as some think, of the English.",
    "And we are preparing thrones for him to sit,",
    "Poems to read, and beds",
    "In which it may please him to rest.",
    "This is the land",
    "The pioneers looked for, shading their eyes",
    "Against the sun\u2014a murmur of serious life."
