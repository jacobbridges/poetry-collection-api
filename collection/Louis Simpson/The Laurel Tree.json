    "In the clear light that confuses everything",
    "Only you, dark laurel,",
    "Shadow my house,",
    "Lifting your arms in the anguish",
    "Of nature at the stake.",
    "And at night, quivering with tears,",
    "You are like the tree called Tasso\u2019s.",
    "Crippled, and hooped with iron,",
    "It stands on Peter\u2019s hill.",
    "When the lovers prop their bicycles",
    "And sit on the high benches",
    "That look across to eternity,",
    "That tree makes their own torsion",
    "Seem natural. And so, they\u2019re comforted.",
    "2",
    "One of the local philosophers ...",
    "He says, \u201cIn California",
    "We have the old anarchist tradition.\u201d",
    "What can he mean? Is there an anarchist tradition?",
    "And why would an anarchist want one?",
    "O California,",
    "Is there a tree without opinions?",
    "Come, let me clasp you!",
    "Let me feel the idea breathing.",
    "I too cry O for a life of sensations",
    "Rather than thoughts\u2014",
    "\u201cThe sayling Pine, the Cedar proud and tall.\u201d",
    "Like the girls in our neighborhood,",
    "They\u2019re beautiful and silent.",
    "3",
    "As I was digging in the back yard",
    "I thought of a man in China.",
    "A lifetime, it seemed, we gazed at each other.",
    "I could see and hear his heartbeats",
    "Like a spade hurling clods.",
    "He pointed behind him, and I saw",
    "That the hills were covered with armed men,",
    "And they were all on the other side",
    "Of the life that I held dear.",
    "He said, \u201cWe are as various",
    "As the twigs of a tree,",
    "But now the tree moves as one man.",
    "It walks. And the earth trembles",
    "When a race of slaves is leaving.\u201d",
    "4",
    "I said, \u201cYet, all these people",
    "Will fall down as one man",
    "When the entrails of a bomb are breathing.",
    "When we came down from Chosin",
    "Carrying the guns in dainty snow-wear",
    "And all the dead we had to,",
    "It was a time of forgetfulness,",
    "Like a plucked string.",
    "It was a river of darkness.",
    "Was it not so on your side, when you came",
    "To the sea that was covered with ships?",
    "Let us speak to each other,",
    "Let the word rise, making dark strokes in the air.",
    "That bird flies over the heads of the armed men.\u201d",
    "5",
    "One part of the tree grows outward.",
    "The other I saw when, with a light,",
    "I explored the cellar\u2014shattering roots.",
    "They had broken through the wall,",
    "As though there were something in my rubbish",
    "That life would have at last.",
    "I must be patient with shapes",
    "Of automobile fenders and ketchup bottles.",
    "These things are the beginning",
    "Of things not visible to the naked eye.",
    "It was so in the time of Tobit\u2014",
    "The dish glowed when the angel held it.",
    "It is so that spiritual messengers",
    "Deliver their meaning."
