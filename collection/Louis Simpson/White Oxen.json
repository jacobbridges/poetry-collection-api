    "A man walks beside them",
    "with a whip that he cracks.",
    "The cart they draw is painted",
    "with Saracens and Crusaders,",
    "fierce eyes and ranks of spears.",
    "They are on the steep road",
    "that goes up the mountain.",
    "Their neat-stepping hoofs",
    "appear to be flickering",
    "in the sun, raising dust.",
    "They are higher than the roofs",
    "on which striped gourds and melons",
    "lie ripening. They move",
    "among the dark green olives",
    "that grow on the rocks.",
    "they dwindle as they climb ...",
    "vanish around a corner",
    "and reappear walking on the edge",
    "of a precipice. They enter",
    "the region of mist and darkness.",
    "I think I can see them still:",
    "a pair of yoked oxen",
    "the color of ivory",
    "or smoke, with red tassels,",
    "in the gathering dusk."
