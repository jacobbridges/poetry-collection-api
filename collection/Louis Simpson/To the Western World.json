    "A siren sang, and Europe turned away",
    "From the high castle and the shepherd\u2019s crook.",
    "Three caravels went sailing to Cathay",
    "On the strange ocean, and the captains shook",
    "Their banners out across the Mexique Bay.",
    "And in our early days we did the same.",
    "Remembering our fathers in their wreck",
    "We crossed the sea from Palos where they came",
    "And saw, enormous to the little deck,",
    "A shore in silence waiting for a name.",
    "The treasures of Cathay were never found.",
    "In this America, this wilderness",
    "Where the axe echoes with a lonely sound,",
    "The generations labor to possess",
    "And grave by grave we civilize the ground."
