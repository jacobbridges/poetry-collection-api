    "I dreamed that in a city dark as Paris",
    "I stood alone in a deserted square.",
    "The night was trembling with a violet",
    "Expectancy. At the far edge it moved",
    "And rumbled; on that flickering horizon",
    "The guns were pumping color in the sky.",
    "There was the Front. But I was lonely here,",
    "Left behind, abandoned by the army.",
    "The empty city and the empty square",
    "Was my inhabitation, my unrest.",
    "The helmet with its vestige of a crest,",
    "The rifle in my hands, long out of date,",
    "The belt I wore, the trailing overcoat",
    "And hobnail boots, were those of a",
    ".",
    "I was the man, as awkward as a bear.",
    "Over the rooftops where cathedrals loomed",
    "In speaking majesty, two aeroplanes",
    "Forlorn as birds, appeared. Then growing large,",
    "The German",
    "and the",
    ",",
    "They chased each other tumbling through the sky,",
    "Till one streamed down on fire to the earth.",
    "These wars have been so great, they are forgotten",
    "Like the Egyptian dynasts. My confrere",
    "In whose thick boots I stood, were you amazed",
    "To wander through my brain four decades later",
    "As I have wandered in a dream through yours?",
    "The violence of waking life disrupts",
    "The order of our death. Strange dreams occur,",
    "For dreams are licensed as they never were."
