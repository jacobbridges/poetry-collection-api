    "The Mayor of Scuttleton burned his nose",
    "Trying to warm his copper toes;",
    "He lost his money and spoiled his will",
    "By signing his name with an icicle-quill;",
    "He went bare-headed, and held his breath,",
    "And frightened his grandame most to death;",
    "He loaded a shovel, and tried to shoot,",
    "And killed the calf in the leg of his boot;",
    "He melted a snow-bird, and formed the habit",
    "Of dancing jigs with a sad Welsh rabbit;",
    "He lived on taffy, and taxed the town;",
    "And read his newspaper upside down;",
    "Then he sighed, and hung his hat on a feather,",
    "And bade the townspeople come together;",
    "But the worst of it all was, nobody knew",
    "What the Mayor of Scuttleton next would do."
