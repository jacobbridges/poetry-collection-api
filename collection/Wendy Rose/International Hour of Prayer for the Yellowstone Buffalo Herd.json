    "From morning\u2019s mouth",
    "the bones emerge,",
    "a prayer is whispered",
    "over rounded horns;",
    "the prairie is beyond",
    "the quivering hump",
    "and holy smoke sparkles",
    "released in the breath.",
    "Braided sweetgrass,",
    "be about their hooves;",
    "although the grip of hunger",
    "lies heavy on the land,",
    "let endless native grasses grow",
    "among the yellow stones",
    "and between the stars.",
    "Even if only one man had",
    "begun to sing, actually",
    "it was thousands, She who came",
    "to Wisconsin farmers",
    "and transformed their lives,",
    "She who brought her blessing",
    "in the form of being newborn,",
    "She whom they named the Miracle,",
    "White Buffalo Calf Maiden must return",
    "amid the fast firing of bullets, along",
    "the most perilous of paths. Rock stars,",
    "millionaires, they all offered millions of dollars",
    "to struggling white farmers",
    "but she had begun her transformation and her prophecy",
    "by touching them and they came to understand",
    "if not the actual words to the prayers",
    "at least the reverence, the need",
    "to protect, to keep the doors open.",
    "Like it was a hundred years ago",
    "bounties are gathered from death;",
    "trains, buses, cars, planes",
    "carry the segmented body of the terrible worm",
    "across the land and the screams of the hunted",
    "split the sun awake. It is time to restore",
    "the stolen beads and shards,",
    "the bones and knives to every grave.",
    "And the graves are graves no longer but wombs;",
    "the bounties burn their hands",
    "and bones come flowing",
    "from museum shelves",
    "to dance in the rippling grass,",
    "rebuilding lungs, starting hearts.",
    "There must be a hundred men",
    "and a hundred men\u2019s worth",
    "of heartlessness; wished they could find",
    "Indians to kill but now that is illegal",
    "so they make up some excuse",
    "to raise their rifles and take aim,",
    "not hearing the rumble",
    "of buffalo prayer, not feeling",
    "tomorrow tremble",
    "or the prophecy of Miracle,",
    "and smile as they see the legs give way,",
    "the horns gouge open the prairie ground,",
    "Earth betrayed again."
