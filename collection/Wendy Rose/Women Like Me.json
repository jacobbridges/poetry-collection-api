    "making promises they can\u2019t keep.",
    "For you, Grandmother, I said I would pull",
    "each invading burr and thistle from your skin,",
    "cut out the dizzy brittle eucalypt,",
    "take from the ground the dark oily poison\u2013",
    "all to restore you happy and proud,",
    "the whole of you transformed",
    "and bursting into tomorrow.",
    "But where do I cut first?",
    "Where should I begin to pull?",
    "Should it be the Russian thistle",
    "down the hill where backhoes",
    "have bitten? Or African senecio",
    "or tumbleweed bouncing",
    "above the wind? Or the middle finger",
    "of my right hand? Or my left eye",
    "or the other one? Or a slice",
    "from the small of my back, a slab of fat",
    "from my thigh? I am broken",
    "as much as any native ground,",
    "my roots tap a thousand migrations.",
    "My daughters were never born, I am",
    "as much the invader as the native,",
    "as much the last day of life as the first.",
    "I presumed you to be as bitter as me,",
    "to tremble and rage against alien weight.",
    "Who should blossom? Who should receive pollen?",
    "Who should be rooted, who pruned,",
    "who watered, who picked?",
    "Should I feed the white-faced cattle",
    "who wait for the death train to come",
    "or comb the wild seeds from their tails?",
    "Who should return across the sea",
    "or the Bering Strait or the world before this one",
    "or the Mother Ground? Who should go screaming",
    "to some other planet, burn up or melt",
    "in a distant sun? Who should be healed",
    "and who hurt? Who should dry",
    "under summer\u2019s white sky, who should shrivel",
    "at the first sign of drought? Who should be remembered?",
    "Who should be the sterile chimera of earth and of another place,",
    "alien with a native face,",
    "native with an alien face?"
