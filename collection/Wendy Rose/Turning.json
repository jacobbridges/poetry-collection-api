    "The song is Gaelic now,",
    "peridot words",
    "the color of fresh",
    "timothy gathered",
    "by red-haired women;",
    "or the song",
    "is the bony white oak",
    "and rhythm of",
    ",",
    "a knowing that breathes",
    "against angles of granite",
    "and meets the ground",
    "in a flurry of sound.",
    "Or the song rides down from a star",
    "over burgundy boulders",
    "beneath a dazzling blue sky",
    "to find the old words",
    "buried deep in the earth.",
    "But this heart listens.",
    "This song.",
    ",",
    "the precious rain awakening.",
    "On this you come",
    "as a prayer in the flesh,",
    "on this you ride",
    "with the roll and rollick",
    "of rattlesnake.",
    "On this you sing",
    "volcanic birthing words",
    "and obsidian cools where",
    "the blood bubbles down.",
    "Oh look, a little girl is lost",
    "although she stands close",
    "to her mother\u2019s heart.",
    "With great energy she scrapes",
    "the missionaries from her ribs.",
    "Shoulder blades curve",
    "around the spine",
    "and the pestle dances,",
    "acorns flying,",
    "and dust collects",
    "in the creases",
    "of her hands. Or",
    "she is kneeling in a small room",
    "at the edge of the mesa,",
    "polished black bone of earth,",
    "cherished",
    "stone,",
    "moving back and forth",
    "this act of love, grinding",
    "the corn until it is dark,",
    "brushing the white cornmeal",
    "into one basket, the blue",
    "into another, thinking already",
    "of the daughters she will bear",
    "glowing in the sun.",
    "Or she is standing at the bog",
    "inside a mountain meadow,",
    "hands raised up to tie back her hair",
    "with a thin red rag; seeds loosen",
    "and cling to her shoes, her stockings,",
    "her long skirt, her skin.",
    "She fearlessly walks",
    "through gold fiddleneck,",
    "small mountain lupines, clouds",
    "of white popcorn flowers fallen upward",
    "out of the ground",
    "to cover the hillside",
    "like snow. Or",
    "a woman gathers loop after loop",
    "of heavy rope to guide the head",
    "of the horse she straddles and sometimes",
    "she is the mare and the soft sandstone",
    "and the hot rocks rolling in acorn soup,",
    "trying to heal the gash spread across her path",
    "where the crescent moon has sliced the earth.",
    "Ocean to mountain to mesa, the bundle she carries",
    "is a sacred memory, a rainbow that arches",
    "from one side of the sky to the other.",
    "Or a woman is closing",
    "a steamer trunk, has to sit on it hard",
    "to get the latch through and",
    "the leather buckled; seagulls dive",
    "outside the wall of the ship, she",
    "hears their demands, maybe one",
    "has come inside to brush her cheek",
    "with its pointed wing or maybe",
    "just another tear warmed by cooling blood.",
    "How she aches in the cold, she is so thin;",
    "and when she pulls the blanket around her",
    "and lies down on the floor, she is no more",
    "than a pile of old rags, a few sticks of firewood,",
    "a broken broom. Steady against the roll of the sea",
    "she is patient as the rocks that wait for the ship",
    "along a northern corridor, angry as the storms",
    "midway across the Atlantic that shake their fists",
    "at those who must leave home, and as deeply hidden",
    "as the icebergs that threaten to disembowl.",
    "She has already seen the world dissolve;",
    "now she feels the breaking",
    "of one last thread",
    "to ancestral land,",
    "feels the very break",
    "of it."
