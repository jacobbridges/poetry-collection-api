    "There are four men mowing down by the Isar;",
    "I can hear the swish of the scythe-strokes, four",
    "Sharp breaths taken: yea, and I",
    "Am sorry for what's in store.",
    "The first man out of the four that's mowing",
    "Is mine, I claim him once and for all;",
    "Though it's sorry I am, on his young feet, knowing",
    "None of the trouble he's led to stall.",
    "As he sees me bringing the dinner, he lifts",
    "His head as proud as a deer that looks",
    "Shoulder-deep out of the corn; and wipes",
    "His scythe-blade bright, unhooks",
    "The scythe-stone and over the stubble to me.",
    "Lad, thou hast gotten a child in me,",
    "Laddie, a man thou'lt ha'e to be,",
    "Yea, though I'm sorry for thee."
