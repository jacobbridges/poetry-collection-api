    "This spring as it comes bursts up in bonfires green,",
    "Wild puffing of emerald trees, and flame-filled bushes,",
    "Thorn-blossom lifting in wreaths of smoke between",
    "Where the wood fumes up and the watery, flickering rushes.",
    "I am amazed at this spring, this conflagration",
    "Of green fires lit on the soil of the earth, this blaze",
    "Of growing, and sparks that puff in wild gyration,",
    "Faces of people streaming across my gaze.",
    "And I, what fountain of fire am I among",
    "This leaping combustion of spring? My spirit is tossed",
    "About like a shadow buffeted in the throng",
    "Of flames, a shadow that's gone astray, and is lost."
