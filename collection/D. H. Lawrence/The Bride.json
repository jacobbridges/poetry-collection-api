    "My love looks like a girl to-night,",
    "But she is old.",
    "The plaits that lie along her pillow",
    "Are not gold,",
    "But threaded with filigree silver,",
    "And uncanny cold.",
    "She looks like a young maiden, since her brow",
    "Is smooth and fair,",
    "Her cheeks are very smooth, her eyes are closed.",
    "She sleeps a rare",
    "Still winsome sleep, so still, and so composed.",
    "Nay, but she sleeps like a bride, and dreams her dreams",
    "Of perfect things.",
    "She lies at last, the darling, in the shape of her dream,",
    "And her dead mouth sings",
    "By its shape, like the thrushes in clear evenings."
