    "Love has crept into her sealed heart",
    "As a field bee, black and amber,",
    "Breaks from the winter-cell, to clamber",
    "Up the warm grass where the sunbeams start.",
    "Love has crept into her summery eyes,",
    "And a glint of colored sunshine brings",
    "Such as his along the folded wings",
    "Of the bee before he flies.",
    "But I with my ruffling, impatient breath",
    "Have loosened the wings of the wild young sprite;",
    "He has opened them out in a reeling flight,",
    "And down her words he hasteneth.",
    "Love flies delighted in her voice:",
    "The hum of his glittering, drunken wings",
    "Sets quivering with music the little things",
    "That she says, and her simple words rejoice."
