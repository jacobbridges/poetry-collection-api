    "The great gold apples of night",
    "Hang from the street's long bough",
    "Dripping their light",
    "On the faces that drift below,",
    "On the faces that drift and blow",
    "Down the night-time, out of sight",
    "In the wind's sad sough.",
    "The ripeness of these apples of night",
    "Distilling over me",
    "Makes sickening the white",
    "Ghost-flux of faces that hie",
    "Them endlessly, endlessly by",
    "Without meaning or reason why",
    "They ever should be."
