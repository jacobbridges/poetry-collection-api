    "Little Bo-Peep has lost her sheep,",
    "And can't tell where to find them;",
    "Leave them alone, and they'll come home,",
    "Bringing their tails behind them.",
    "Little Bo-Peep fell fast asleep,",
    "And dreamt she heard them bleating;",
    "But when she awoke, she found it a joke,",
    "For they were still all fleeting.",
    "Then up she took her little crook,",
    "Determined for to find them;",
    "She found them indeed, but it made her heart bleed,",
    "For they'd left their tails behind them.",
    "It happened one day, as Bo-Peep did stray",
    "Into a meadow hard by,",
    "There she espied their tails, side by side,",
    "All hung on a tree to dry.",
    "She heaved a sigh and wiped her eye,",
    "And over the hillocks she raced;",
    "And tried what she could, as a shepherdess should,",
    "That each tail be properly placed."
