    "as if it were a scene made-up by the mind,",
    "that is not mine, but is a made place,",
    "that is mine, it is so near to the heart,",
    "an eternal pasture folded in all thought",
    "so that there is a hall therein",
    "that is a made place, created by light",
    "wherefrom the shadows that are forms fall.",
    "Wherefrom fall all architectures I am",
    "I say are likenesses of the First Beloved",
    "whose flowers are flames lit to the Lady.",
    "She it is Queen Under The Hill",
    "whose hosts are a disturbance of words within words",
    "that is a field folded.",
    "It is only a dream of the grass blowing",
    "east against the source of the sun",
    "in an hour before the sun\u2019s going down",
    "whose secret we see in a children\u2019s game",
    "of ring a round of roses told.",
    "Often I am permitted to return to a meadow",
    "as if it were a given property of the mind",
    "that certain bounds hold against chaos,",
    "that is a place of first permission,",
    "everlasting omen of what is."
