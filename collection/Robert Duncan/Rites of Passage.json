    "II",
    "Something is taking place.",
    "Horns thrust upward from the brow.",
    "Hooves beat impatient where feet once were.",
    "My son, youth grows alarming in your face.",
    "Your innocent regard is cruelly charming to me now.",
    "You bristle where my fond hand would stir",
    "to stroke your cheek. I do not dare.",
    "Irregular meters beat between your heart and mine.",
    "Snuffling the air you take the heat and scan",
    "the lines you take in going as if I were or were not there",
    "and overtake me.",
    "And where it seems but yesterday I spilld the wine,",
    "you too grow beastly to become a man.",
    "Peace, peace. I\u2019ve had enough. What can I say",
    "when song\u2019s demanded? \u2014I\u2019ve had my fill of song?",
    "My longing to sing grows full. Time\u2019s emptied me.",
    "And where my youth was, now the Sun in you grows hot, your day",
    "is young, my place you take triumphantly. All along",
    "it\u2019s been for you, for this lowering of your horns in challenge. She",
    "had her will of me and will not",
    "let my struggling spirit in itself be free."
