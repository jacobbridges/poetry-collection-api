    "From Michigan our son writes, How many elk?",
    "How many big horn sheep? It's spring,",
    "and soon they'll be gone above timberline,",
    "climbing to tundra by summer. Some boys",
    "are born to wander, my wife says, but rocky slopes",
    "with spruce and Douglas fir are home.",
    "He tried the navy, the marines, but even the army",
    "wouldn't take him, not with a foot like that.",
    "Maybe it's in the genes. I think of wild-eyed years",
    "till I was twenty, and cringe. I loved motorcycles,",
    "too dumb to say no to our son\u2014too many switchbacks",
    "in mountains, too many icy spots in spring.",
    "Doctors stitched back his scalp, hoisted him in traction",
    "like a twisted frame. I sold the motorbike to a junkyard,",
    "but half his foot was gone. Last month, he cashed",
    "his paycheck at the Harley house, roared off",
    "with nothing but a backpack, waving his headband,",
    "leaning into a downhill curve and gone."
