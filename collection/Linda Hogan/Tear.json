    "But when the cloth was torn,",
    "it was like tears,",
    "impossible to hold back,",

    "by this other name,",

    "I remember the women.",
    "Tonight they walk",
    "out from the shadows",
    "with black dogs,",
    "children, the dark heavy horses,",
    "and worn-out men.",
    "They walk inside me. This blood",
    "is a map of the road between us.",
    "I am why they survived.",
    "The world behind them did not close.",
    "The world before them is still open.",
    "All around me are my ancestors,",
    "my unborn children.",
    "I am the tear between them",
    "and both sides live."
