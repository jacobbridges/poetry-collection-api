    "First",
    "there was some other order of things",
    "never spoken",
    "but in dreams of darkest creation.",
    "Then there was black earth,",
    "lake, the face of light on water.",
    "Then the thick forest all around",
    "that light,",
    "and then the human clay",
    "whose blood we still carry",
    "rose up in us",
    "who remember caves with red bison",
    "painted in their own blood,",
    "after their kind.",
    "A wildness",
    "swam inside our mothers,",
    "desire through closed eyes,",
    "a new child",
    "wearing the red, wet mask of birth,",
    "delivered into this land",
    "already wounded,",
    "stolen and burned",
    "beyond reckoning.",
    "Red is this yielding land",
    "turned inside out",
    "by a country of hunters",
    "with iron, flint and fire.",
    "Red is the fear",
    "that turns a knife back",
    "against men, holds it at their throats,",
    "and they cannot see the claw on the handle,",
    "the animal hand",
    "that haunts them",
    "from some place inside their blood.",
    "So that is hunting, birth,",
    "and one kind of death.",
    "Then there was medicine, the healing of wounds.",
    "Red was the infinite fruit",
    "of stolen bodies.",
    "The doctors wanted to know",
    "what invented disease",
    "how wounds healed",
    "from inside themselves",
    "how life stands up in skin,",
    "if not by magic.",
    "They divined the red shadows of leeches",
    "that swam in white bowls of water:",
    "they believed stars",
    "in the cup of sky.",
    "They cut the wall of skin",
    "to let",
    "what was bad escape",
    "but they were reading the story of fire",
    "gone out",
    "and that was a science.",
    "As for the animal hand on death\u2019s knife,",
    "knives have as many sides",
    "as the red father of war",
    "who signs his name",
    "in the blood of other men.",
    "And red was the soldier",
    "who crawled",
    "through a ditch",
    "of human blood in order to live.",
    "It was the canal of his deliverance.",
    "It is his son who lives near me.",
    "Red is the thunder in our ears",
    "when we meet.",
    "Love, like creation,",
    "is some other order of things.",
    "Red is the share of fire",
    "I have stolen",
    "from root, hoof, fallen fruit.",
    "And this was hunger.",
    "Red is the human house",
    "I come back to at night",
    "swimming inside the cave of skin",
    "that remembers bison.",
    "In that round nation",
    "of blood",
    "we are all burning,",
    "red, inseparable fires",
    "the living have crawled",
    "and climbed through",
    "in order to live",
    "so nothing will be left",
    "for death at the end.",
    "This life in the fire, I love it.",
    "I want it,",
    "this life."
