    "To be held",
    "by the light",
    "was what I wanted,",
    "to be a tree drinking the rain,",
    "no longer parched in this hot land.",
    "To be roots in a tunnel growing",
    "but also to be sheltering the inborn leaves",
    "and the green slide of mineral",
    "down the immense distances",
    "into infinite comfort",
    "and the land here, only clay,",
    "still contains and consumes",
    "the thirsty need",
    "the way a tree always shelters the unborn life",
    "waiting for the healing",
    "after the storm",
    "which has been our life."
