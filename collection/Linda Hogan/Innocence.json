    "There is nothing more innocent",
    "than the still-unformed creature I find beneath soil,",
    "neither of us knowing what it will become",
    "in the abundance of the planet.",
    "It makes a living only by remaining still",
    "in its niche.",
    "One day it may struggle out of its tender",
    "pearl of blind skin",
    "with a wing or with vision",
    "leaving behind the transparent.",
    "I cover it again, keep laboring,",
    "hands in earth, myself a singular body.",
    "Watching things grow,",
    "wondering how",
    "a cut blade of grass knows",
    "how to turn sharp again at the end.",
    "This same growing must be myself,",
    "not aware yet of what I will become",
    "in my own fullness",
    "inside this simple flesh."
