    "The language of cranes",
    "we once were told",
    "is the wind. The wind",
    "is their method,",
    "their current, the translated story",
    "of life they write across the sky.",
    "Millions of years",
    "they have blown here",
    "on ancestral longing,",
    "their wings of wide arrival,",
    "necks long, legs stretched out",
    "above strands of earth",
    "where they arrive",
    "with the shine of water,",
    "stories, interminable",
    "language of exchanges",
    "descended from the sky",
    "and then they stand,",
    "earth made only of crane",
    "from bank to bank of the river",
    "as far as you can see",
    "the ancient story made new."
