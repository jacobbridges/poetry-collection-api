    "The weight of a man on a woman",
    "is like falling into the river without drowning.",
    "Above, the world is burning and fighting.",
    "Lost worlds flow through others.",
    "But down here beneath water\u2019s skin,",
    "river floor, sand, everything",
    "is floating, rocking.",
    "Water falls through our hands as we fall through it.",
    "And when a woman and a man come up from water",
    "they stand at the elemental edge of difference.",
    "Mirrored on water\u2019s skin,",
    "they are fired clay, water evaporating into air.",
    "They are where water turns away from land",
    "and goes back to enter a larger sea.",
    "A man and a woman are like those rivers,",
    "entering a larger sea",
    "greater than the sum of all its parts."
