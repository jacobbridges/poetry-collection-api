    "She rarely made us do it\u2014",
    "we\u2019d clear the table instead\u2014so my sister and I teased",
    "that some day we\u2019d train our children right",
    "and not end up like her, after every meal stuck",
    "with red knuckles, a bleached rag to wipe and wring.",
    "The one chore she spared us: gummy plates",
    "in water greasy and swirling with sloughed peas,",
    "globs of egg and gravy.",
    "Or did she guard her place",
    "at the window? Not wanting to give up the gloss",
    "of the magnolia, the school traffic humming.",
    "Sunset, finches at the feeder. First sightings",
    "of the mail truck at the curb, just after noon,",
    "delivering a note, a card, the least bit of news."
