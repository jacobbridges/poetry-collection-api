    "You are like me, you will die too, but not today:",

    "and place, strawberries spread through your name",

    "of some spring, the waters as cool and clear",
    "(late rain clings to your leaves, shaken by light wind),",

    "no snow (I dreamed the snow was you,",
    "when there was snow), you are my right,",

    "with several flowers, words spill from your mouth",
    "in waves, your lips taste like the sea, salt-sweet (trees",
    "and seas have flown away, I call it",
    "loving you): home is nowhere, therefore you,",
    "a kind of dwell and welcome, song after all,",
    "and free of any eden we can name"
