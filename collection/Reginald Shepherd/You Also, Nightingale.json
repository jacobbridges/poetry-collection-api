    "Petrarch dreams of pebbles",
    "on the tongue, he loves me",
    "at a distance, black polished stone",
    "skipping the lake that swallows",
    "worn-down words, a kind of drown",
    "and drench and quench and very kind",
    "to what I would've said. Light marries",
    "water and what else (unfit",
    "for drinking purposes), light lavishes",
    "my skin on intermittent sun. (I am weather",
    "and unreasonable, out of all",
    "season. Petrarch loves my lies",
    "of laurel leaves, ripped sprigs of",
    "deciduous evergreen.) A creek is lying",
    "in my cement-walled bed, slurring",
    "through the center of small",
    "town; the current's brown and",
    "turbid (muddy, turbulent",
    "with recent torrents), silt rushing",
    "toward the reservoir. A Sonata",
    "passes by too close (I have to jump)",
    "and yes I do hear music here. It's blue, or",
    "turquoise, aquamarine, some synonym",
    "on wheels, note down that note. It's Petrarch",
    "singing with his back to me (delivering",
    "himself to voice), his fingers",
    "filled with jonquil, daffodils, mistaken",
    "narcissus. (I surprised him",
    "between the pages of a book,",
    "looked up the flowers I misnamed.)",
    "Forsythia and magnolia bring me",
    "spring, when he walks into the house",
    "he has wings. Song is a temporary thing",
    "(attempt), he wants to own his music."
