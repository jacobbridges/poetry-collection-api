    "The cypress is the tree\u2019s grief and not",
    "the tree, and it has no shadow because it is",
    "the tree\u2019s shadow",
    "Bassam Hajjar",
    "The cypress broke like a minaret, and slept on",
    "the road upon its chapped shadow, dark, green,",
    "as it has always been. No one got hurt. The vehicles",
    "sped over its branches. The dust blew",
    "into the windshields ... / The cypress broke, but",
    "the pigeon in a neighboring house didn\u2019t change",
    "its public nest. And two migrant birds hovered above",
    "the hem of the place, and exchanged some symbols.",
    "And a woman said to her neighbor: Say, did you see a storm?",
    "She said: No, and no bulldozer either ... / And the cypress",
    "broke. And those passing by the wreckage said:",
    "Maybe it got bored with being neglected, or it grew old",
    "with the days, it is long like a giraffe, and little",
    "in meaning like a dust broom, and couldn\u2019t shade two lovers.",
    "And a boy said: I used to draw it perfectly,",
    "its figure was easy to draw. And a girl said: The sky today",
    "is incomplete because the cypress broke.",
    "And a young man said: But the sky today is complete",
    "because the cypress broke. And I said",
    "to myself: Neither mystery nor clarity,",
    "the cypress broke, and that is all",
    "there is to it: the cypress broke!"
