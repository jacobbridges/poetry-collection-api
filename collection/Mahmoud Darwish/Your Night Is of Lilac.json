    "The night sits wherever you are. Your night",
    "is of lilac. Every now and then a gesture escapes",
    "from the beam of your dimples, breaks the wineglass",
    "and lights up the starlight. And your night is your shadow\u2014",
    "a fairy-tale piece of land to make our dreams",
    "equal. I am not a traveler or a dweller",
    "in your lilac night, I am he who was one day",
    "me. Whenever night grew in you I guessed",
    "the heart\u2019s rank between two grades: neither",
    "the self accepts, nor the soul accepts. But in our bodies",
    "a heaven and an earth embrace. And all of you",
    "is your night ... radiant night like planet ink. Night",
    "is the covenant of night, crawling in my body",
    "anesthetized like a fox\u2019s sleepiness. Night diffusing a mystery",
    "that illuminates my language, whenever it is clearer",
    "I become more fearful of a tomorrow in the fist. Night",
    "staring at itself safe and assured in its",
    "endlessness, nothing celebrates it except its mirror",
    "and the ancient shepherd songs in a summer of emperors",
    "who get sick on love. Night that flourished in its Jahili poetry",
    "on the whims of Imru\u2019 el-Qyss and others,",
    "and widened for the dreamers the milk path to a hungry",
    "moon in the remoteness of speech ..."
