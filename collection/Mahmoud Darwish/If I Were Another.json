    "If I were another on the road, I would not have looked",
    "back, I would have said what one traveler said",
    "to another: Stranger! awaken",
    "the guitar more! Delay our tomorrow so our road",
    "may extend and space may widen for us, and we may get rescued",
    "from our story together: you are so much yourself ... and I am",
    "so much other than myself right here before you!",
    "If I were another I would have belonged to the road,",
    "neither you nor I would return. Awaken the guitar",
    "and we might sense the unknown and the route that tempts",
    "the traveler to test gravity. I am only",
    "my steps, and you are both my compass and my chasm.",
    "If I were another on the road, I would have",
    "hidden my emotions in the suitcase, so my poem",
    "would be of water, diaphanous, white,",
    "abstract, and lightweight ... stronger than memory,",
    "and weaker than dewdrops, and I would have said:",
    "My identity is this expanse!",
    "If I were another on the road, I would have said",
    "to the guitar: Teach me an extra string!",
    "Because the house is farther, and the road to it prettier\u2014",
    "that\u2019s what my new song would say. Whenever",
    "the road lengthens the meaning renews, and I become two",
    "on this road: I ... and another!"
