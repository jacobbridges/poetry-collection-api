    "A dinner party, coffee, tea,",
    "Sandwich, or supper, all may be",
    "In their way pleasant. But to me",
    "Not one of these deserves the praise",
    "That welcomer of new-born days,",
    ", merits; ever giving",
    "Cheerful notice we are living",
    "Another day refreshed by sleep,",
    "When its festival we keep.",
    "Now although I would not slight",
    "Those kindly words we use \u2018Good night\u2019,",
    "Yet parting words are words of sorrow,",
    "And may not vie with sweet \u2018Good Morrow\u2019,",
    "With which again our friends we greet,",
    "When in the breakfast-room we meet,",
    "At the social table round,",
    "Listening to the lively sound",
    "Of those notes which never tire,",
    "Of urn, or kettle on the fire.",
    "Sleepy Robert never hears",
    "Or urn, or kettle; he appears",
    "When all have finished, one by one",
    "Dropping off, and breakfast done.",
    "Yet has he too his own pleasure,",
    "His breakfast hour\u2019s his hour of leisure;",
    "And, left alone, he reads or muses,",
    "Or else in idle mood he uses",
    "To sit and watch the venturous fly,",
    "Where the sugar\u2019s piled high,",
    "Clambering o\u2019er the lumps so white,",
    "Rocky cliffs of sweet delight."
