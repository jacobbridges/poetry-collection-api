    "A Creole boy from the West Indies brought,",
    "To be in European learning taught,",
    "Some years before to Westminster he went,",
    "To a Preparatory school was sent.",
    "When from his artless tale the mistress found",
    "The child had not one friend on English ground,",
    "She ev\u2019n as if she his own mother were,",
    "Made the dark Indian her particular care.",
    "Oft on her favourite\u2019s future lot she thought;",
    "To know the bent of his young mind she sought,",
    "For much the kind preceptress wished to find",
    "To what profession he was most inclined,",
    "That where his genius led they might him train;",
    "For nature\u2019s kindly bent she held not vain.",
    "But vain her efforts to explore his will;",
    "The frequent question he evaded still;",
    "Till on a day at length he to her came,",
    "Joy sparkling in his eyes; and said, the same",
    "Trade he would be those boys of colour were,",
    "Who danced so happy in the open air.",
    "It was a troop of chimney-sweeping boys,",
    "With wooden music and obstreperous noise,",
    "In tarnish\u2019d finery and grotesque array,",
    "Were dancing in the streets the first of May."
