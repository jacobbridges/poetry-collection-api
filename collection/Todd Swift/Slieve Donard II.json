    "for lack of view. Before",
    "the perpetual gas fire, stunned",
    "as if into stone, entering",
    "as you enter your Anne Bront\u00eb,",
    "a world muted, chemically arranged,",
    "I try renewal of a mind remade.",

    "a closet, from which tumbles a victim,",
    "providing a fitting climax. Mrs. Pontifax",
    "is staying across the hall. The glamour.",
    "She is the Minister of Finance\u2019s daughter.",

    "Our age is blinded by celebrity, seeing",
    "with the gilded orb of a bronze, dull god.",

    "after we have slaked and fed. As you read",
    "this becomes the first one written under the influence",
    "of an anti-depressed self, whatever that is to be.",
    "What is, is taken off a shelf, a remaining wrack",
    "that half emerges from the brackish ruins of the year.",
    "Will love reunite?",
    "Will Ireland be solvent?",
    "All nights, holiest, least holy,",
    "be still, be silent."
