    "I saw the spot where our first parents dwelt;",
    "And yet it wore to me no face of change,",
    "For while amid its fields and groves, I felt",
    "As if I had not sinned, nor thought it strange;",
    "My eye seemed but a part of every sight,",
    "My ear heard music in each sound that rose;",
    "Each sense forever found a new delight,",
    "Such as the spirit\u2019s vision only knows;",
    "Each act some new and ever-varying joy",
    "Did my Father\u2019s love for me prepare;",
    "To dress the spot my ever fresh employ,",
    "And in the glorious whole with Him to share;",
    "No more without the flaming gate to stray,",
    "No more for sin\u2019s dark stain the debt of death to pay."
