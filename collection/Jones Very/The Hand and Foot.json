    "The hand and foot that stir not, they shall find",
    "Sooner than all the rightful place to go;",
    "Now in their motion free as roving wind,",
    "Though first no snail more limited and slow;",
    "I mark them full of labor all the day,",
    "Each active motion made in perfect rest;",
    "They cannot from their path mistaken stray,",
    "Though \u2019tis not theirs, yet in it they are blest;",
    "The bird has not their hidden track found out,",
    "Nor cunning fox, though full of art he be;",
    "It is the way unseen, the certain route,",
    "Where ever bound, yet thou art ever free;",
    "The path of Him, whose perfect law of love",
    "Bids spheres and atoms in just order move."
