    "Before the moths have even appeared",
    "to orbit around them, the streetlamps come on,",
    "a long row of them glowing uselessly",
    "along the ring of garden that circles the city center,",
    "where your steps count down the dulling of daylight.",
    "At your feet, a bee crawls in small circles like a toy unwinding.",
    "Summer specializes in time, slows it down almost to dream.",
    "And the noisy day goes so quiet you can hear",
    "the bedraggled man who visits each trash receptacle",
    "mutter in disbelief:",
    "Summer lingers, but it\u2019s about ending. It\u2019s about how things",
    "redden and ripen and burst and come down. It\u2019s when",
    "city workers cut down trees, demolishing",
    "one limb at a time, spilling the crumbs",
    "of twigs and leaves all over the tablecloth of street.",
    "the man softly exclaims",
    "while beside him blooms a large gray rose of pigeons",
    "huddled around a dropped piece of bread."
