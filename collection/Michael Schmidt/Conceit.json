    "She spun a line. She knew he was listening to her.",
    "She spun it and he took the fraying ends.",
    "Whatever she was saying, it was cotton,",
    "Then as he rolled the thread between",
    "Forefinger and thumb it turned to silk,",
    "And as he took the needle up to thread it",
    "The line she spun became thin finest gold.",
    "He knew not to believe her but he took it",
    "Because she kept on spinning like the truth",
    "Was ravelling from her lips; he watched her lips.",
    "Cotton, silk and gold, she wanted him",
    "To take the line and sew the wound right up",
    "Although she held the blade still in her hand",
    "Behind her back, and it was dripping, steaming.",
    "There under his left arm the gash lay open",
    "Like a mouth in disbelief. And he believed her."
