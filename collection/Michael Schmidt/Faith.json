    "When I cannot believe,",
    "The brown herds still move across green fields",
    "Into the tufty hills, and I was born",
    "Higher, where I could watch them as a bird might.",
    "When even memory seems imagined, what",
    "Can I bring to prayer? A pair of knees.",
    "The great faith that built a stair to heaven",
    "As now my memory tries to climb a hill,",
    "Becomes an old stone building, a deaf priest",
    "Whose hand is in the pockets of his parish,",
    "Who longs to buy a bell he'll never hear.",
    "The water in the font is cold, I trace",
    "A circle on my brow and not a cross."
