    "The man sits in a timelessness",
    "with the horse under him in time",
    "to a movement of legs and hooves",
    "upon a timeless sand.",

    "present in the picture as time",
    "he reads outward from",
    "and comes from that beginning.",
    "A wind blows in",
    "and out and all about the man",
    "as the horse ran",
    "and runs to come in time.",
    "A house is burning in the sand.",
    "A man and horse are burning.",
    "The wind is burning.",
    "They are running to arrive."
