    "So many forget-me-nots, with their white centers,",
    "scattered, you'd say, if there weren't",
    "so many everywhere, as many as the stars",
    "last night in between the branches",
    "above the porch, behind the house.",
    "Was it an argument or were there just",
    "things they had to say?",
    "I could have faith in so many creatures\u2014",
    "the old setter from the neighbor yard",
    "who follows me around the corner",
    "and no longer, the chick with its new beak",
    "just past breakable whose lighter top feathers",
    "have a bit of flight, any mother bear\u2014",
    "you say things and the next day",
    "it's like they don't matter, we want our faces",
    "to alter though we don't want to get older, neither",
    "do we want to get younger, repetition",
    "with less knowledge is ridiculous,",
    "just ask the Greeks, you get to keep",
    "being a tree but without the branch",
    "that showed the sky your starlike shape?",
    "I don't think so. Steadiness can be useful,",
    "but my loyalty loves a form",
    "that will follow me through changes.",
    "At a diagonal the dark woods",
    "on the back slope have enough space",
    "to walk between, not enough to hide.",
    "He looks into them",
    "and writes notes to his mother, she",
    "looks into them and finds alignment,",
    "or looks for what she wants.",
    "She has a human skeleton on her desk.",
    "He has a protractor. I had wishes",
    "for both of them yesterday",
    "but the weather has become so kindly,",
    "so temperate, I forget what blessings",
    "they don't think they have."
