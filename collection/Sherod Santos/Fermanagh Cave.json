    "An emerald dungeon\u2019s blacklight glow",
    "glimmered in the deeper reaches",
    "where my son and I could hear the slub",
    "of water riddling through the muck.",
    "We\u2019d stumbled on it following a stream,",
    "his first cave made stranger still",
    "by a chill that closes on the goblined heart",
    "of a boy inflamed by stories where",
    "gnome-clans hoarded underground",
    "bone-shard, mandrake, monkey gland,",
    "and eel. And so, grave Hansel",
    "paying out his last scraps of bread,",
    "he inched inward looking back",
    "and gathering himself as he devolved",
    "step by step along the wet-ribbed walls,",
    "the omphalos seepage of a subterranea",
    "that dreamed us into its kingdom come,",
    "where like some secret dreams",
    "make known the burnt-punk smell",
    "of marijuana cluttered up the air,",
    "and just beyond, just close enough to see,",
    "a spur of light that like a dwindling",
    "eyemote disappeared. Then the sound",
    "a human soul makes as it slips out",
    "from the throat. Composed in darkness,",
    "my son\u2019s hand closed on mine. I bent",
    "to whisper we could turn back now,",
    "but his voice was there before me saying,",
    "\u201cSomething\u2019s here.\u201d And something was,",
    "something that in that instant rose,",
    "and moved off from us, or drew up close.",
    "In either case, my son came to me",
    "almost weightlessly at first, then hungry",
    "for what was filling up my arms,",
    "the startled, upriding bodyweight",
    "of a boy I\u2019d never before felt rock",
    "so solidly into the place I was,",
    "blind and hunkered in the earthen air.",
    "I held him only a moment there.",
    "We didn\u2019t speak. And though the wheeze",
    "of his breathing must\u2019ve stopped my ears,",
    "for weeks to come, settling him back",
    "to sleep at night, or waking him",
    "from some troubling dream, I\u2019d hear",
    "the soft concussion of an outsized heart-",
    "beat I could not decide was mine,",
    "or his, or the stranger\u2019s I had brought us to.",
    "Or if what happened would happen again,",
    "years from now, when he is grown,",
    "and I have grown newly strange to him."
