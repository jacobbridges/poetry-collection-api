    "This Little, Silent, Gloomy Monument,",
    "Contains all that was sweet and innocent ;",
    "The softest pratler that e'er found a Tongue,",
    "His Voice was Musick and his Words a Song ;",
    "Which now each List'ning Angel smiling hears,",
    "Such pretty Harmonies compose the Spheres;",
    "Wanton as unfledg'd Cupids, ere their Charms",
    "Has learn'd the little arts of doing harms ;",
    "Fair as young Cherubins, as soft and kind,",
    "And tho translated could not be refin'd ;",
    "The Seventh dear pledge the Nuptial Joys had given,",
    "Toil'd here on Earth, retir'd to rest in Heaven ;",
    "Where they the shining Host of Angels fill,",
    "Spread their gay wings before the Throne, and smile."
