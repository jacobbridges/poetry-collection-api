    "All trembling in my arms Aminta lay,",
    "Defending of the bliss I strove to take;",
    "Raising my rapture by her kind delay,",
    "Her force so charming was and weak.",
    "The soft resistance did betray the grant,",
    "While I pressed on the heaven of my desires;",
    "Her rising breasts with nimbler motions pant;",
    "Her dying eyes assume new fires.",
    "Now to the height of languishment she grows,",
    "And still her looks new charms put on;",
    "Now the last mystery of Love she knows,",
    "We sigh, and kiss: I waked, and all was done.",
    "\u2018Twas but a dream, yet by my heart I knew,",
    "Which still was panting, part of it was true:",
    "Oh how I strove the rest to have believed;",
    "Ashamed and angry to be undeceived!"
