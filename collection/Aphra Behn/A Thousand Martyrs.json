    "A thousand martyrs I have made,",
    "All sacrificed to my desire;",
    "A thousand beauties have betrayed,",
    "That languish in resistless fire.",
    "The untamed heart to hand I brought,",
    "And fixed the wild and wandering thought.",
    "I never vowed nor sighed in vain",
    "But both, though false, were well received.",
    "The fair are pleased to give us pain,",
    "And what they wish is soon believed.",
    "And though I talked of wounds and smart,",
    "Love\u2019s pleasures only touched my heart.",
    "Alone the glory and the spoil",
    "I always laughing bore away;",
    "The triumphs, without pain or toil,",
    "Without the hell, the heav\u2019n of joy.",
    "And while I thus at random rove",
    "Despise the fools that whine for love."
