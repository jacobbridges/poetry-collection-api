    "The sky has been dark",
    "for many years.",
    "My skin has become as damp",
    "and pale as rice paper",
    "and feels the way",
    "mother\u2019s used to before the drying sun",
    "parched it out there in the fields.",
    "Lately, when I touch my eyelids,",
    "my hands react as if",
    "I had just touched something",
    "hot enough to burn.",
    "My skin, aspirin colored,",
    "tingles with migraine. Mother",
    "has been massaging the left side of my face",
    "especially in the evenings",
    "when the pain flares up.",
    "This morning",
    "her breathing was graveled,",
    "her voice gruff with affection",
    "when I wheeled her into the bath.",
    "She was in a good humor,",
    "making jokes about her great breasts,",
    "floating in the milky water",
    "like two walruses,",
    "flaccid and whiskered around the nipples.",
    "I scrubbed them with a sour taste",
    "in my mouth, thinking:",
    "six children and an old man",
    "have sucked from these brown nipples.",
    "I was almost tender",
    "when I came to the blue bruises",
    "that freckle her body,",
    "places where she has been injecting insulin",
    "for thirty years. I soaped her slowly,",
    "she sighed deeply, her eyes closed.",
    "It seems it has always",
    "been like this: the two of us",
    "in this sunless room,",
    "the splashing of the bathwater.",
    "In the afternoons",
    "when she has rested,",
    "she prepares our ritual of tea and rice,",
    "garnished with a shred of gingered fish,",
    "a slice of pickled turnip,",
    "a token for my white body.",
    "We eat in the familiar silence.",
    "She knows I am not to be trusted,",
    "even now planning my escape.",
    "As I toast to her health",
    "with the tea she has poured,",
    "a thousand cranes curtain the window,",
    "fly up in a sudden breeze."
