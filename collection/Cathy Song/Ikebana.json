    "To prepare the body,",
    "aim for the translucent perfection",
    "you find in the sliced shavings",
    "of a pickled turnip.",
    "In order for this to happen,",
    "you must avoid the sun,",
    "protect the face",
    "under a paper parasol",
    "until it is bruised white",
    "like the skin of lilies.",
    "Use white soap",
    "from a blue porcelain",
    "dish for this.",
    "Restrict yourself.",
    "Eat the whites of things:",
    "tender bamboo shoots,",
    "the veins of the young iris,",
    "the clouded eye of a fish.",
    "Then wrap the body,",
    "as if it were a perfumed gift,",
    "in pieces of silk",
    "held together with invisible threads",
    "like a kite, weighing no more",
    "than a handful of crushed chrysanthemums.",
    "Light enough to float in the wind.",
    "You want the effect",
    "of koi moving through water.",
    "When the light leaves",
    "the room, twist lilacs",
    "into the lacquered hair",
    "piled high like a complicated shrine.",
    "There should be tiny bells",
    "inserted somewhere",
    "in the web of hair",
    "to imitate crickets",
    "singing in a hidden grove.",
    "Reveal the nape of the neck,",
    "your beauty spot.",
    "Hold the arrangement.",
    "If your spine slacks",
    "and you feel faint,",
    "remember the hand-picked flower",
    "set in the front alcove,",
    "which, just this morning,",
    "you so skillfully wired into place.",
    "How poised it is!",
    "Petal and leaf",
    "curving like a fan,",
    "the stem snipped and wedged",
    "into the metal base\u2014",
    "to appear like a spontaneous accident."
