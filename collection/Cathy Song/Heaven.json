    "He thinks when we die we\u2019ll go to China.",
    "Think of it\u2014a Chinese heaven",
    "where, except for his blond hair,",
    "the part that belongs to his father,",
    "everyone will look like him.",
    "China, that blue flower on the map,",
    "bluer than the sea",
    "his hand must span like a bridge",
    "to reach it.",
    "An octave away.",
    "I\u2019ve never seen it.",
    "It\u2019s as if I can\u2019t sing that far.",
    "But look\u2014",
    "on the map, this black dot.",
    "Here is where we live,",
    "on the pancake plains",
    "just east of the Rockies,",
    "on the other side of the clouds.",
    "A mile above the sea,",
    "the air is so thin, you can starve on it.",
    "No bamboo trees",
    "but the alpine equivalent,",
    "reedy aspen with light, fluttering leaves.",
    "Did a boy in Guangzhou dream of this",
    "as his last stop?",
    "I\u2019ve heard the trains at night",
    "whistling past our yards,",
    "what we\u2019ve come to own,",
    "the broken fences, the whiny dog, the rattletrap cars.",
    "It\u2019s still the wild west,",
    "mean and grubby,",
    "the shootouts and fistfights in the back alley.",
    "With my son the dreamer",
    "and my daughter, who is too young to walk,",
    "I\u2019ve sat in this spot",
    "and wondered why here?",
    "Why in this short life,",
    "this town, this creek they call a river?",
    "He had never planned to stay,",
    "the boy who helped to build",
    "the railroads for a dollar a day.",
    "He had always meant to go back.",
    "When did he finally know",
    "that each mile of track led him further away,",
    "that he would die in his sleep,",
    "dispossessed,",
    "having seen Gold Mountain,",
    "the icy wind tunneling through it,",
    "these landlocked, makeshift ghost towns?",
    "It must be in the blood,",
    "this notion of returning.",
    "It skipped two generations, lay fallow,",
    "the garden an unmarked grave.",
    "On a spring sweater day",
    "it\u2019s as if we remember him.",
    "I call to the children.",
    "We can see the mountains",
    "shimmering blue above the air.",
    "If you look really hard",
    "says my son the dreamer,",
    "leaning out from the laundry\u2019s rigging,",
    "the work shirts fluttering like sails,",
    "you can see all the way to heaven."
