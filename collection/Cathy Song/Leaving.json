    "Wahiawa is still",
    "a red dirt town",
    "where the sticky smell",
    "of pineapples",
    "being lopped off",
    "in the low-lying fields",
    "rises to mix",
    "with the minty leaves",
    "of eucalyptus",
    "in the bordering gulch.",
    "We lived there",
    "near the edge",
    "where the orchids grew huge",
    "as lanterns overnight",
    "and the passion fruits rotted",
    "on the vines",
    "before they could be picked.",
    "We grew there",
    "in the steady rain",
    "that fell like a gray curtain",
    "through which my mother peered:",
    "patches of depression.",
    "She kept the children under cover.",
    "We built houses within houses,",
    "stripping our parents\u2019 bed",
    "of pillows and sheets,",
    "erecting walls out of",
    "which my father had subscribed to",
    "for years. We feasted",
    "on those pictures of the world,",
    "while the mud oozed",
    "past the windows",
    "knocking over the drab green leaves",
    "of palm fronds",
    "as we ate our spinach.",
    "The mildew grew in rings",
    "around the sink",
    "where centipedes came",
    "swimming up the pipes",
    "on multiple feet",
    "and the mold grew",
    "around our small fingers",
    "making everything slippery",
    "to touch.",
    "We were squeamish and pale.",
    "I remember one night",
    "my sister screamed.",
    "All the lights blinked on",
    "in the house.",
    "In the sudden brightness,",
    "we rushed to her room",
    "and found her crumpled",
    "in the far corner of the bed,",
    "her nightgown twisted in a strange shape;",
    "her eyes were as huge as mine,",
    "staring into the eyes of the bat",
    "that clung to the screen.",
    "Its rodent fingers",
    "finally letting go",
    "as my father jabbed its furry body",
    "with the end of a broom."
