    "Only a dad, with a tired face,",
    "Coming home from the daily race,",
    "Bringing little of gold or fame,",
    "To show how well he has played the game,",
    "But glad in his heart that his own rejoice",
    "To see him come, and to hear his voice.",
    "Only a dad, with a brood of four,",
    "One of ten million men or more.",
    "Plodding along in the daily strife,",
    "Bearing the whips and the scorns of life,",
    "With never a whimper of pain or hate,",
    "For the sake of those who at home await.",
    "Only a dad, neither rich nor proud,",
    "Merely one of the surging crowd",
    "Toiling, striving from day to day,",
    "Facing whatever may come his way,",
    "Silent, whenever the harsh condemn,",
    "And bearing it all for the love of them.",
    "Only a dad, but he gives his all",
    "To smooth the way for his children small,",
    "Doing, with courage stern and grim,",
    "The deeds that his father did for him.",
    "This is the line that for him I pen,",
    "Only a dad,",
