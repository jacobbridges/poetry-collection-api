    "The crowded street his playground is, a patch of blue his sky;",
    "A puddle in a vacant lot his sea where ships pass by:",
    "Poor little orphan boy of five, the city smoke and grime",
    "Taint every cooling breeze he gets throughout the summer time;",
    "And he is just as your boy is, a child who loves to play,",
    "Except that he is drawn and white and cannot get away.",
    "And he would like the open fields, for often in his dreams",
    "The angels kind bear him off to where are pleasant streams,",
    "Where he may sail a splendid boat, sometimes he flies a kite,",
    "Or romps beside a shepherd dog and shouts with all his might;",
    "But when the dawn of morning comes he wakes to find once more",
    "That what he thought were sun-kissed hills are rags upon the floor.",
    "Then through the hot and sultry day he plays at \u201cmake-pretend,\u201d",
    "The alley is a sandy beach where all the rich folks send",
    "Their little boys and girls to play, a barrel is his boat,",
    "But, oh, the air is tifling and the dust fills up his throat;",
    "And though he tries so very hard to play, somehow it seems",
    "He never gets such wondrous joys as angels bring in dreams.",
    "Poor little orphan boy of five, except that he is pale,",
    "With sunken cheeks and hollow eyes and very wan and frail,",
    "Just like that little boy of yours, with same desire to play,",
    "Fond of the open fields and skies, he\u2019s built the self-same way;",
    "But kept by fate and circumstance away from shady streams,",
    "His only joy comes when he sleeps and angels bring him dreams."
