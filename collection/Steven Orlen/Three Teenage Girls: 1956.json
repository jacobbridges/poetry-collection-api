    "Three teenage girls in tight red sleeveless blouses and black Capri pants",
    "And colorful headscarves secured in a knot to their chins",
    "Are walking down the hill, chatting, laughing,",
    "Cupping their cigarettes against the light rain,",
    "The closest to the road with her left thumb stuck out",
    "Not looking at the cars going past.",
    "Every Friday night to the dance, and wet or dry",
    "They get where they\u2019re going, walk two miles or get a ride,",
    "And now the two-door 1950 Dodge, dark green",
    "Darkening as evening falls, stops, they nudge",
    "Each other, peer in, shrug, two scramble into the back seat,",
    "And the third, the boldest, famous",
    "For twice running away from home, slides in front with the man",
    "Who reaches across her body and pulls the door shut."
