    "In the house of the voice of Maria Callas",
    "We hear the baby\u2019s cries, and the after-supper",
    "Rattle of silverware, and three clocks ticking",
    "To different tunes, and ripe plums",
    "Sleeping in their chipped bowl, and traffic sounds",
    "Dissecting the avenues outside. We hear, like water",
    "Pouring over time itself, the pure distillate arias",
    "Of the numerous pampered queens who have reigned,",
    "And the working girls who have suffered",
    "The envious knives, and the breathless brides",
    "With their horned helmets who have fallen in love",
    "And gone crazy or fallen in love and died",
    "On the grand stage at their appointed moments\u2014",
    "Who will sing of them now? Maria Callas is dead,",
    "Although the full lips and the slanting eyes",
    "And flared nostrils of her voice resurrect",
    "Dramas we are able to imagine in this parlor",
    "On evenings like this one, adding some color,",
    "Adding some order. Of whom it was said:"
