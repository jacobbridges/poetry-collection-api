    "Tonight I light the candles of my eyes in the lee",
    "And swing down this branch full of red leaves.",
    "Yellow moon, skull and spine of the hare,",
    "Arrow me to town on the neck of the air.",
    "I hear the undertaker make love in the heather;",
    "The candy maker, poor fellow, is under the weather.",
    "Skunk, moose, raccoon, they go to the doors in threes",
    "With a torch in their hands or pleas: \"O, please . . .\"",
    "Baruch Spinoza and the butcher are drunk:",
    "One is the tail and one is the trunk",
    "Of a beast who dances in circles for beer",
    "And doesn't think twice to learn how to steer.",
    "Our clock is blind, our clock is dumb.",
    "Its hands are broken, its fingers numb.",
    "No time for the martyr of our fair town",
    "Who wasn't a witch because she could drown.",
    "Now the dogs of the cemetery are starting to bark",
    "At the vision of her, bobbing up through the dark.",
    "When she opens her mouth to gasp for air,",
    "A moth flies out and lands in her hair.",
    "The apples are thumping, winter is coming.",
    "The lips of the pumpkin soon will be humming.",
    "By the caw of the crow on the first of the year,",
    "Something will die, something appear."
