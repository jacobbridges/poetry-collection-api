    "happy from angelhair fine as a strand of cat",
    "hair split six ways and brushed into the skin",
    "to itch and itch again.",
    "We were wild and giddy with gifts.",
    "It was then and always as all souls itch and spin",
    "in lit-red coats that float down this narrow vein,",
    "so we spin in O, to someone who loves us",
    "and suffers the world for each turn before a mirror,",
    "quiet as ice, we fall all through at last",
    "here in memory\u2019s tiny Paradise."
