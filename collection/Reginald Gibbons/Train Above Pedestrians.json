    "Where moonlight angles",
    "through the east-west streets,",
    "down among the old",
    "for America",
    "tall buildings that changed",
    "the streets of other",
    "cities circulate",
    "elevated trains",
    "overhead shrieking",
    "and drumming, lit by",
    "explosions of sparks",
    "that harm no one and",
    "the shadowed persons",
    "walking underneath",
    "the erratic waves",
    "not of the lake but",
    "of noise move through fog",
    "sieved by the steel mesh",
    "of the supporting",
    "structures or through rain",
    "that rinses pavements",
    "and the el platforms",
    "or through new snow that",
    "quiets corners, moods,",
    "riveted careers.",
    "Working for others",
    "with hands, backs, machines,",
    "men built hard towers",
    "that part the high air,",
    "women and men built,",
    "cooked, cleaned, delivered,",
    "typed and filed, carried",
    "and delivered, priced",
    "and sold. The river",
    "and air were filthy.",
    "In a hundred years",
    "builders would migrate",

    "even try to list",
    "the kinds of places",
    "men and women made",
    "to make money? Not",
    "enough of them, yet",
    "too many. From slow",

    "great uncles and gone",

    "that which was built to",
    "be torn down again",
    "someday, for those who",
    "got good wages out",
    "of all this building",
    "or were broken by",
    "it, or both, yet whose",
