    "Soldiers are citizens of death's grey land,",
    "Drawing no dividend from time's to-morrows.",
    "In the great hour of destiny they stand,",
    "Each with his feuds, and jealousies, and sorrows.",
    "Soldiers are sworn to action; they must win",
    "Some flaming, fatal climax with their lives.",
    "Soldiers are dreamers; when the guns begin",
    "They think of firelit homes, clean beds and wives.",
    "I see them in foul dug-outs, gnawed by rats,",
    "And in the ruined trenches, lashed with rain,",
    "Dreaming of things they did with balls and bats,",
    "And mocked by hopeless longing to regain",
    "Bank-holidays, and picture shows, and spats,",
    "And going to the office in the train."
