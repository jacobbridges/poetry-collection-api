    "You are carrying me, full consciousness, god that has desires,",
    "all through the world.",
    "Here, in this third sea,",
    "I almost hear your voice: your voice, the wind,",
    "filling entirely all movements;",
    "eternal colors and eternal lights,",
    "sea colors and sea lights.",
    "Your voice full of white fire",
    "in the universe of water, the ship, the sky,",
    "marking out the roads with delight,",
    "engraving for me with a blazing light my firm orbit:",
    "a black body",
    "with the glowing diamond in its center."
