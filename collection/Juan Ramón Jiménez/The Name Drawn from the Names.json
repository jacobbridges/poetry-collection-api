    "If I have created a world for you, in your place,",
    "god, you had to come to it confident,",
    "and you have come to it, to my refuge,",
    "because my whole world was nothing but my hope.",
    "I have been saving up my hope",
    "in language, in a spoken name, a written name;",
    "I had given a name to everything,",
    "and you have taken the place",
    "of all these names.",
    "Now I can hold back my movement",
    "inside the coal of my continual living and being,",
    "as the flame reins itself back inside the red coal,",
    "surrounded by air that is all blue fire;",
    "now I am my own sea that has been suddenly stopped somewhere,",
    "the sea I used to speak of, but not heavy,",
    "stiffened into waves of an awareness filled with light,",
    "and all of them moving upward, upward.",
    "All the names that I gave",
    "to the universe that I created again for you",
    "are now all turning into one name, into one",
    "god.",
    "The god who, in the end, is always",
    "the god created and recreated and recreated",
    "through grace and never through force.",
    "The God. The name drawn from the names."
