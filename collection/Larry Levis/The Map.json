    "Applying to Heavy Equipment School",
    "I marched farther into the Great Plains",
    "And refused to come out.",
    "I threw up a few scaffolds of disinterest.",
    "Around me in the fields, the hogs grunted",
    "And lay on their sides.",
    "You came with a little water and went away.",
    "The glass is still on the table,",
    "And the paper,",
    "And the burned scaffolds.",
    "*",
    "You were bent over the sink, washing your stockings.",
    "I came up behind you like the night sky behind the town.",
    "You stood frowning at your knuckles",
    "And did not speak.",
    "*",
    "At night I lie still, like Bolivia.",
    "My furnaces turn blue.",
    "My forests go dark.",
    "You are a low range of hills, a Paraguay.",
    "Now the clouds cover us both.",
    "It is raining and the movie houses are open."
