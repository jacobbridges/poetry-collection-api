    "Sister once of weeds & a dark water that held still",
    "In ditches reflecting the odd,",
    "Abstaining clouds that passed, & kept",
    "Their own counsel, we",
    "Were different, we kept our own counsel.",
    "Outside the tool shed in the noon heat, while our father",
    "Ground some piece of metal",
    "That would finally fit, with grease & an hour of pushing,",
    "The needs of the mysterious Ford tractor,",
    "We argued out, in adolescence,",
    "Whole systems of mathematics, ethics,",
    "And finally agreed that",
    ",",
    "Whose long vowel sounded like the pigeons,",
    "Roosting stupidly & about to be shot",
    "In the barn, was impossible",
    "If one was born a Catholic. The Swedish",
    "Lutherans, whom the nuns called",
    "\u201cStatue smashers,\u201d the Japanese on",
    "Neighboring farms, were, we guessed,",
    "A little better off ....",
    "When I was twelve, I used to stare at weeds",
    "Along the road, at the way they kept trembling",
    "Long after a car had passed;",
    "Or at gnats in families hovering over",
    "Some rotting peaches, & wonder why it was",
    "I had been born a human.",
    "Why not a weed, or a gnat?",
    "Why not a horse, or a spider? And why an American?",
    "I did not think that anything could choose me",
    "To be a Larry Levis before there even",
    "A Larry Levis. It was strange, but not strange enough",
    "To warrant some design.",
    "On the outside,",
    "The barn, with flaking paint, was still off-white.",
    "Inside, it was always dark, all the way up",
    "To the rafters where the pigeons moaned,",
    "I later thought, as if in sexual complaint,",
    "Or sexual abandon; I never found out which.",
    "When I walked in with a 12-gauge & started shooting,",
    "They fell, like gray fruit, at my feet\u2014",
    "Fat, thumping things that grew quieter",
    "When their eyelids, a softer gray, closed,",
    "Part of the way, at least,",
    "And their friends or lovers flew out a kind of skylight",
    "Cut for loading hay.",
    "I don\u2019t know, exactly, what happened then.",
    "Except my sister moved to Switzerland.",
    "My brother got a job",
    "With Colgate-Palmolive.",
    "He was selling soap in Lodi, California.",
    "Later, in his car, & dressed",
    "To die, or live again, forever,",
    "I drove to my own, first wedding.",
    "I smelled the stale boutonniere in my lapel,",
    "A deceased young flower.",
    "I wondered how my brother\u2019s Buick",
    "Could go so fast, &,",
    "Still questioning, or catching, a last time,",
    "An old chill from childhood,",
    "I thought: why me, why her, & knew it wouldn\u2019t last."
