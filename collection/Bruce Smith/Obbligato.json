    "Late August was a pressure drop,",
    "rain, a sob in the body,",
    "a handful of air",
    "with a dream in it,",
    "summer was desperate",
    "to paradise itself with blackberry",
    "drupelets and swarms, everything",
    "polychromed, glazed, sprinkler caps",
    "gushing, the stars like sweat",
    "on a boxer's skin. A voice",
    "from the day says",
    "Tax cuts",
    "for the rich or scratch",
    "what itches or it's a sax",
    "from Bitches Brew,",
    "and I'm a fool",
    "for these horns",
    "and hues, this maudlin",
    "light. It's a currency of feeling",
    "in unremembered March.",
    "There's a war on and snow in the",
    "city",
    "where we've made our desire stop",
    "and start. In the dying school of Bruce",
    "I'm the student who still believes",
    "in the bad taste of the beautiful",
    "and the sadness of songs",
    "made in the ratio",
    "of bruise for bruise."
