    "January. I pluck it,",

    "only head-high, caught by the down,",
    "iridescent, turkey. Another",
    "feather hugging the ditch",
    "along the fence line and another...",
    "A coyote somewhere naps",
    "happy, grinning like the feather",
    "evolved from a leaf. What luck.",
    "Clouds lift above the field",
    "as if to swallow my eye",
    "into hunger. Good hunger.",
    "The greatest eye must",
    "behold me like an ember",
    "dropped into a finch nest,",
    "and I smoke at the mouth",
    "like a gun dreaming in a safe",
    "of a war it can win by virtue",
    "of its praise. I have lost",
    "the killer phrase I concocted",
    "on my country walk",
    "with the feather in my pocket.",
    "I cock it."
