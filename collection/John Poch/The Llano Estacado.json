    "If you\u2019re a staked plains, dry-land, long view man:",
    "a sky\u2019s worth. Some even sow the dry playa",
    "mid-summer with sorghum, the cotton plowed under",
    "after early hail. Thus, not every farmer keeps",
    "an old broken homestead sacred as a graveyard.",
    "Today, no Sharpshin on a pivot for an omen,",
    "no stoic farmer on a turn-row changing water.",
    "Among a little wind grit, in a grid on a grid, somewhere",
    "like the crossroads of outer space and Earth, Texas,",
    "a handful of ragged elms withstand a long sway",
    "of heat and wind. These old guards of a home haunt",
    "the field but wither even as ghosts must. Honor them",
    "with a walk among homesick bricks, and prophesy good."
