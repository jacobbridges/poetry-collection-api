    "You\u2019re right in life\u2019s chamber music",
    "either listen with total attention or else switch off",
    "Water one drop can perfectly lock up these shores",
    "The crash of waves has no gap is like a tailored body",
    "still sitting on the rock the lilac-scented surrounding ocean",
    "still striking at a little girl\u2019s unceasing gaze into distance",
    "Purple or white petals are stored in the eyes",
    "all through the springtime night, dark rings around the eyes",
    "keep opening torn by where she looks far away",
    "Suffering is that waiting, underwater pearl",
    "what turns old is salt low sobbing in every wave",
    "The fierce wind is a jade bracelet on the wrist",
    "Island like a boat sailing since the day you were born",
    "never slowing down its disconsolate speed",
    "always arriving yet, underfoot, drawn away by the ebbing tide",
    "Purple wounds the turbulent, close-up scene",
    "sets off white the horizon like land cutting, above snow line, into fate",
    "exposing the snow flower you\u2019ve caught for life",
    "Still wet tears run halfway down the girl\u2019s cheeks",
    "After so many years play the cold rain you\u2019ve brought back",
    "A seagull plunges then flies back up You hear clearly this kiss"
