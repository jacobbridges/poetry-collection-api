    "Child, how happy you are sitting in the dust, playing with a broken twig all the morning.",
    "I smile at your play with that little bit of a broken twig.",
    "I am busy with my accounts, adding up figures by the hour.",
    "Perhaps you glance at me and think, \"What a stupid game to spoil your morning with!\"",
    "Child, I have forgotten the art of being absorbed in sticks and mud-pies.",
    "I seek out costly playthings, and gather lumps of gold and silver.",
    "With whatever you find you create your glad games, I spend both my time and my strength over things I never can obtain.",
    "In my frail canoe I struggle to cross the sea of desire, and forget that I too am playing a game."
