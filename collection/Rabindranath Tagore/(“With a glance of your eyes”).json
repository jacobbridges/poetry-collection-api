    "XII",
    "With a glance of your eyes you could plunder all the wealth of songs struck from poets\u2019 harps, fair woman!",
    "But for their praises you have no ear; therefore do I come to praise you.",
    "You could humble at your feet the proudest heads of all the world;",
    "But it is your loved ones, unknown to fame, whom you choose to worship; therefore I worship you.",
    "Your perfect arms would add glory to kingly splendor with their touch;",
    "But you use them to sweep away the dust, and to make clean your humble home; therefore I am filled with awe."
