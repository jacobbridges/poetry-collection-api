    "You came to my door in the dawn and sang; it angered me to be awakened from sleep, and you went away unheeded.",
    "You came in the noon and asked for water; it vexed me in my work, and you were sent away with reproaches.",
    "You came in the evening with your flaming torches.",
    "You seemed to me like a terror and I shut my door.",
    "Now in the midnight I sit alone in my lampless room and call you back whom I turned away in insult."
