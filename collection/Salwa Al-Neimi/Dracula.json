    "the long, pointed, ill-fated fang stared at me,",
    "(in spite of awkward attempts to hide it).",
    "Stealing adolescent glances,",
    "I dreamed it pierced me, pushing deep in the base of my neck.",

    "(dentistry can work miracles),",
    "I turned my apostate face,",
    "and squinting, pretended to watch passersby."
