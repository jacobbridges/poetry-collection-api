    "on your face and shoulders, keep a sharp eye",

    "If you come to Mojacar",

    "or risk the sting of losing a loved one.",
    "If you come to Mojacar",

    "in the morning, lock your door and all",
    "the wooden windows because nightmares in silver",
    "dresses will arrive to slip into your bed."
