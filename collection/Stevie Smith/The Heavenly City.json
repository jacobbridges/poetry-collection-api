    "I sigh for the heavenly country,",
    "Where the heavenly people pass,",
    "And the sea is as quiet as a mirror",
    "Of beautiful beautiful glass.",
    "I walk in the heavenly field,",
    "With lilies and poppies bright,",
    "I am dressed in a heavenly coat",
    "Of polished white.",
    "When I walk in the heavenly parkland",
    "My feet on the pasture are bare,",
    "Tall waves the grass, but no harmful",
    "Creature is there.",
    "At night I fly over the housetops,",
    "And stand on the bright moony beams;",
    "Gold are all heaven\u2019s rivers,",
    "And silver her streams."
