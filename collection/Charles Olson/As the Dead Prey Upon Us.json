    "As the dead prey upon us,",
    "they are the dead in ourselves,",
    "awake, my sleeping ones, I cry out to you,",
    "disentangle the nets of being!",
    "I pushed my car, it had been sitting so long unused.",
    "I thought the tires looked as though they only needed air.",
    "But suddenly the huge underbody was above me, and the rear tires",
    "were masses of rubber and thread variously clinging together",
    "as were the dead souls in the living room, gathered",
    "about my mother, some of them taking care to pass",
    "beneath the beam of the movie projector, some record",
    "playing on the victrola, and all of them",
    "desperate with the tawdriness of their life in hell",
    "I turned to the young man on my right and asked, \u201cHow is it,",
    "there?\u201d And he begged me protestingly don\u2019t ask, we are poor",
    "poor. And the whole room was suddenly posters and presentations",
    "of brake linings and other automotive accessories, cardboard",
    "displays, the dead roaming from one to another",
    "as bored back in life as they are in hell, poor and doomed",
    "to mere equipments",
    "my mother, as alive as ever she was, asleep",
    "when I entered the house as I often found her in a rocker",
    "under the lamp, and awaking, as I came up to her, as she ever had",
    "I found out she returns to the house once a week, and with her",
    "the throng of the unknown young who center on her as much in death",
    "as other like suited and dressed people did in life",
    "O the dead!",
    "and the Indian woman and I",
    "enabled the blue deer",
    "to walk",
    "and the blue deer talked,",
    "in the next room,",
    "a Negro talk",
    "it was like walking a jackass,",
    "and its talk",
    "was the pressing gabber of gammers",
    "of old women",
    "and we helped walk it around the room",
    "because it was seeking socks",
    "or shoes for its hooves",
    "now that it was acquiring",
    "human possibilities",
    "In the five hindrances men and angels",
    "stay caught in the net, in the immense nets",
    "which spread out across each plane of being, the multiple nets",
    "which hamper at each step of the ladders as the angels",
    "and the demons",
    "and men",
    "go up and down",
    "Walk the jackass",
    "Hear the victrola",
    "Let the automobile",
    "be tucked into a corner of the white fence",
    "when it is a white chair. Purity",
    "is only an instant of being, the trammels",
    "recur",
    "In the five hindrances, perfection",
    "is hidden",
    "I shall get",
    "to the place",
    "10 minutes late.",
    "It will be 20 minutes",
    "of 9. And I don\u2019t know,",
    "without the car,",
    "how I shall get there",
    "O peace, my mother, I do not know",
    "how differently I could have done",
    "what I did or did not do.",
    "That you are back each week",
    "that you fall asleep",
    "with your face to the right",
    "that you are present there",
    "when I come in as you were",
    "when you were alive",
    "that you are as solid, and your flesh",
    "is as I knew it, that you have the company",
    "I am used to your having",
    "but o, that you all find it",
    "such a cheapness!",
    "o peace, mother, for the mammothness",
    "of the comings and goings",
    "of the ladders of life",
    "The nets we are entangled in. Awake,",
    "my soul, let the power into the last wrinkle",
    "of being, let none of the threads and rubber of the tires",
    "be left upon the earth. Let even your mother",
    "go. Let there be only paradise",
    "The desperateness is, that the instant",
    "which is also paradise (paradise",
    "is happiness) dissolves",
    "into the next instant, and power",
    "flows to meet the next occurrence",
    "Is it any wonder",
    "my mother comes back?",
    "Do not that throng",
    "rightly seek the room",
    "where they might expect",
    "happiness? They did not complain",
    "of life, they obviously wanted",
    "the movie, each other, merely to pass",
    "among each other there,",
    "where the real is, even to the display cards,",
    "to be out of hell",
    "The poverty",
    "of hell",
    "O souls, in life and in death,",
    "make, even as you sleep, even in sleep",
    "know what wind",
    "even under the crankcase of the ugly automobile",
    "lifts it away, clears the sodden weights of goods,",
    "equipment, entertainment, the foods the Indian woman,",
    "the filthy blue deer, the 4 by 3 foot \u2018Viewbook,\u2019",
    "the heaviness of the old house, the stuffed inner room",
    "lifts the sodden nets",
    "and they disappear as ghosts do,",
    "as spider webs, nothing",
    "before the hand of man",
    "The vent! You must have the vent,",
    "or you shall die. Which means",
    "never to die, the ghastliness",
    "of going, and forever",
    "coming back, returning",
    "to the instants which were not lived",
    "O mother, this I could not have done,",
    "I could not have lived what you didn\u2019t,",
    "I am myself netted in my own being",
    "I want to die. I want to make that instant, too,",
    "perfect",
    "O my soul, slip",
    "the cog",
    "II",
    "The death in life (death itself)",
    "is endless, eternity",
    "is the false cause",
    "The knot is other wise, each topological corner",
    "presents itself, and no sword",
    "cuts it, each knot is itself its fire",
    "each knot of which the net is made",
    "is for the hands to untake",
    "the knot\u2019s making. And touch alone",
    "can turn the knot into its own flame",
    "(o mother, if you had once touched me",
    "o mother, if I had once touched you)",
    "The car did not burn. Its underside",
    "was not presented to me",
    "a grotesque corpse. The old man",
    "merely removed it as I looked up at it,",
    "and put it in a corner of the picket fence",
    "like was it my mother\u2019s white dog?",
    "or a child\u2019s chair",
    "The woman,",
    "playing on the grass,",
    "with her son (the woman next door)",
    "was angry with me whatever it was",
    "slipped across the playpen or whatever",
    "she had out there on the grass",
    "And I was quite flip in reply",
    "that anyone who used plastic",
    "had to expect things to skid",
    "and break, that I couldn\u2019t worry",
    "that her son might have been hurt",
    "by whatever it was I sent skidding",
    "down on them.",
    "It was just then I went into my house",
    "and to my utter astonishment",
    "found my mother sitting there",
    "as she always had sat, as must she always",
    "forever sit there her head lolling",
    "into sleep? Awake, awake my mother",
    "what wind will lift you too",
    "forever from the tawdriness,",
    "make you rich as all those souls",
    "crave crave crave",
    "to be rich?",
    "They are right. We must have",
    "what we want. We cannot afford",
    "not to. We have only one course:",
    "the nets which entangle us are flames",
    "O souls, burn",
    "alive, burn now",
    "that you may forever",
    "have peace, have",
    "what you crave",
    "O souls,",
    "go into everything,",
    "let not one knot pass",
    "through your fingers",
    "let not any they tell you",
    "you must sleep as the net",
    "comes through your authentic hands",
    "What passes",
    "is what is, what shall be, what has",
    "been, what hell and heaven is",
    "is earth to be rent, to shoot you",
    "through the screen of flame which each knot",
    "hides as all knots are a wall ready",
    "to be shot open by you",
    "the nets of being",
    "are only eternal if you sleep as your hands",
    "ought to be busy. Method, method",
    "I too call on you to come",
    "to the aid of all men, to women most",
    "who know most, to woman to tell",
    "men to awake. Awake, men,",
    "awake",
    "I ask my mother",
    "to sleep. I ask her",
    "to stay in the chair.",
    "My chair",
    "is in the corner of the fence.",
    "She sits by the fireplace made of paving stones. The blue deer",
    "need not trouble either of us.",
    "And if she sits in happiness the souls",
    "who trouble her and me",
    "will also rest. The automobile",
    "has been hauled away."
