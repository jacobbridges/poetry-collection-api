    "I come like a swirl of black and darken up your day;",
    "I whip it all into my womb, lift you and your things,",
    "carry you to where you've never been, and maybe,",
    "if I feel good, I might bring you back, all warm and scared,",
    "heart humming wild like a bird after early sudden flight.",
    "I tremble at the elements. When thunder rolls my womb",
    "trembles, remembering the tweak of contractions",
    "that tightened to a wail when my mother pushed me out",
    "into the black of a tornado night.",
    "you can tell us from far, by the crazy of our hair;",
    "couldn't tame it if we tried. Even now I tie a bandanna",
    "to silence the din of anarchy in these coir-thick plaits.",
    "born in the whirl of clouds; the center crumbled,",
    "then I came. My lovers know the blast of my chaotic giving;",
    "they tremble at the whip of my supple thighs;",
    "you cross me at your peril, I swallow light",
    "when the warm of anger lashes me into a spin,",
    "the pine trees bend to me swept in my gyrations.",
    "When the spirit takes my head, I hurtle into the vacuum",
    "of white sheets billowing and paint a swirl of color,",
    "streaked with my many songs."
