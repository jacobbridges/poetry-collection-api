    "I look out the bars upon the Castle",
    "the crust caked row of age",
    "in a corner my friendly spider",
    "crouches for the unwary gnats",
    "of my days.",
    "So much there is we must atone.",
    "There are spires of faith",
    "in the invisible claws of spiders",
    "in the flight and curve of gulls.",
    "These know, I swear,",
    "the contours of the rolling Saharas",
    "and the destitute oceans of our history.",
    "We sit, debating the charity of our captors.",
    "At night lights come on",
    "the shoreline bends into a broad bay",
    "near the Castle",
    "the sea is gray",
    "Yesterday it rained on the eve",
    "of my forty-first year",
    "and left all my defeats intact",
    "Let me lead you into the country",
    "It is only as half clansman",
    "of the ritual goat",
    "that I bring my song to the place of sacrifice",
    "here in the pain fields",
    "asphalt and smoke of a large hearth",
    "I lead",
    "my rope is short.",
    "I shall soon arrive under the tree.",
    "I will stage a hundred fights in honor of our Gods",
    "and our beloved leader",
    "Here, I could care less for the toiling masses",
    "I retreated here before Lent",
    "to my own stretch of sea front",
    "(I cannot see the damned sea",
    "because of old caked walls",
    "built by Dutchmen)",
    "But the shore falls into a deep gulf",
    "there are no cliffs.",
    "They found a week-old baby",
    "buried in a shallow grave",
    "on the front lawn of the fort.",
    "I want my grave to be deeper.",
    "They are sawing through our firewood",
    "Today is cassava day",
    "The flutist is silent",
    "Perhaps his troops have arrived in Georgia",
    "Not to arrive upsets me",
    "And for the path that I have trod",
    "I have no regrets"
