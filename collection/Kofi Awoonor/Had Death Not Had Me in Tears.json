    "Had death not had me in tears",
    "I would have seen the barges",
    "on life's stream sail.",
    "I would have heard sorrow songs",
    "in groves where the road was lost",
    "long",
    "where men foot prints mix with other men foot prints",
    "By the road I wait",
    "\"death is better, death is better\"",
    "came the song",
    "I am by the roadside",
    "looking for the road",
    "death is better, death is much better",
    "Had death not had me in tears",
    "I would have seen the barges",
    "I would have found the road",
    "and heard the sorrow songs.",
    "The land wreathes in rhythm",
    "with your soul, caressed by history",
    "and cruel geography",
    "landscape ineffable yet screaming",
    "eloquent resonant like the drums",
    "of after harvests.",
    "We pile rocks on terracing love",
    "Carry the pithy cloth",
    "to cover the hearths of our mother.",
    "Come now, you lucky ones",
    "come to the festival of corn and lamb",
    "to the finest feast of this land",
    "come, now,",
    "your lovers have unfurled",
    "their cloths",
    "their thighs glistening like golden knives",
    "ready for the plunging,",
    "for the plentiful loving time.",
    "To whom shall I turn",
    "to what shall I tell my woes ?",
    "My kinsmen, the desert tree",
    "denied us sustenance",
    "long before the drought.",
    "To whom shall I turn",
    "to whom shall I tell my woes?",
    "Some say tell the mother goat",
    "she too is my kinswoman",
    "elemental sister of your clan",
    "But I cannot tell the mother goat",
    "for she is not here."
