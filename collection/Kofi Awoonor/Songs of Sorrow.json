    "I.",
    "Dzogbese Lisa has treated me thus",
    "It has led me among the sharps of the forest",
    "Returning is not possible",
    "And going forward is a great difficulty",
    "The affairs of this world are like the chameleon feces",
    "Into which I have stepped",
    "When I clean it cannot go.",
    "I am on the world's extreme corner,",
    "I am not sitting in the row with the eminent",
    "But those who are lucky",
    "Sit in the middle and forget",
    "I am on the world's extreme corner",
    "I can only go beyond and forget.",
    "My people, I have been somewhere",
    "If I turn here, the rain beats me",
    "If I turn there the sun burns me",
    "The firewood of this world",
    "Is for only those who can take heart",
    "That is why not all can gather it.",
    "The world is not good for anybody",
    "But you are so happy with your fate;",
    "Alas! The travelers are back",
    "All covered with debt.",
    "II.",
    "Something has happened to me",
    "The things so great that I cannot weep;",
    "I have no sons to fire the gun when I die",
    "And no daughters to wail when I close my mouth",
    "I have wandered on the wilderness",
    "The great wilderness men call life",
    "The rain has beaten me,",
    "And the sharp stumps cut as keen as knives",
    "I shall go beyond and rest.",
    "I have no kin and no brother,",
    "Death has made war upon our house;",
    "And Kpeti's great household is no more,",
    "Only the broken fence stands;",
    "And those who dared not look in his face",
    "Have come out as men.",
    "How well their pride is with them.",
    "Let those gone before take note",
    "They have treated their offspring badly.",
    "What is the wailing for?",
    "Somebody is dead. Agosu himself",
    "Alas! A snake has bitten me",
    "My right arm is broken,",
    "And the tree on which I lean is fallen.",
    "Agosi if you go tell them,",
    "Tell Nyidevu, Kpeti, and Kove",
    "That they have done us evil;",
    "Tell them their house is falling",
    "And the trees in the fence",
    "Have been eaten by termites;",
    "That the martels curse them.",
    "Ask them why they idle there",
    "While we suffer, and eat sand.",
    "And the crow and the vulture",
    "Hover always above our broken fences",
    "And strangers walk over our portion."
