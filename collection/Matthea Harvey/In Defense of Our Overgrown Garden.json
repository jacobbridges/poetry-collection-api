    "Last night the apple trees shook and gave each lettuce a heart",
    "Six hard red apples broke through the greenhouse glass and",
    "Landed in the middle of those ever-so-slightly green leaves",
    "That seem no mix of seeds and soil but of pastels and light and",
    "Chalk x\u2019s mark our oaks that are supposed to be cut down",
    "I\u2019ve seen the neighbors frown when they look over the fence",
    "And see our espalier pear trees bowing out of shape I did like that",
    "They looked like candelabras against the wall but what\u2019s the sense",
    "In swooning over pruning I said as much to Mrs. Jones and I swear",
    "She threw her cane at me and walked off down the street without",
    "It has always puzzled me that people coo over bonsai trees when",
    "You can squint your eyes and shrink anything without much of",
    "A struggle ensued with some starlings and the strawberry nets",
    "So after untangling the two I took the nets off and watched birds",
    "With red beaks fly by all morning at the window I reread your letter",
    "About how the castles you flew over made crenellated shadows on",
    "The water in the rainbarrel has overflowed and made a small swamp",
    "I think the potatoes might turn out slightly damp don\u2019t worry",
    "If there is no fog on the day you come home I will build a bonfire",
    "So the smoke will make the cedars look the way you like them",
    "To close I\u2019m sorry there won\u2019t be any salad and I love you"
