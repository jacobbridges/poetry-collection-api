    "Pity the bathtub that belongs to the queen its feet",
    "Are bronze casts of the former queen\u2019s feet its sheen",
    "A sign of fretting is that an inferior stone shows through",
    "Where the marble is worn away with industrious",
    "Polishing the tub does not take long it is tiny some say",
    "Because the queen does not want room for splashing",
    "The maid thinks otherwise she knows the king",
    "Does not grip the queen nightly in his arms there are",
    "Others the queen does not have lovers she obeys",
    "Her mother once told her",
    "Support then is what she gets in the bathtub she floats",
    "Never holds her nose and goes under not because",
    "She might sink but because she knows to keep her ears",
    "Above water she smiles at the circle of courtiers below",
    "Her feet are kicking against walls which cannot give",
    "Satisfaction at best is to manage to stay clean",
    "2.",
    "Pity the bathtub its forced embrace of the whims of",
    "One man loves but is not loved in return by the object",
    "Of his affection there is little to tell of his profession",
    "There is more for it is because he works with glass",
    "That he thinks things are clear (he loves) and adjustable",
    "(she does not love) he knows how to take something",
    "Small and hard and hot and make room for",
    "His breath quickens at night as he dreams of her he wants",
    "To create a present unlike any other and because he cannot",
    "Hold her he designs something that can a bathtub of",
    "Glass shimmers red when it is hot he pours it into the mold",
    "In a rush of passion only as it begins to cool does it reflect",
    "His foolishness enrages him he throws off his clothes meaning",
    "To jump in and lie there but it is still too hot and his feet propel",
    "Him forward he runs from one end to the other then falls",
    "To the floor blisters begin to swell on his soft feet he watches",
    "His pain harden into a pretty pattern on the bottom of the bath",
    "3.",
    "Pity the bathtub its forced embrace of the human",
    "Form may define external appearance but there is room",
    "For improvement within try a soap dish that allows for",
    "Slippage is inevitable as is difference in the size of",
    "The subject may hoard his or her bubbles at different",
    "Ends of the bathtub may grasp the sponge tightly or",
    "Loosely it may be assumed that eventually everyone gets in",
    "The bath has a place in our lives and our place is",
    "Within it we have control of how much hot how much cold",
    "What to pour in how long we want to stay when to",
    "Return is inevitable because we need something",
    "To define ourselves against even if we know that",
    "Whenever we want we can pull the plug and get out",
    "Which is not the case with our own tighter confinement",
    "Inside the body oh pity the bathtub but pity us too"
