    "He was tall, lean, serious",
    "about his profession,",
    "said it disturbed him",
    "to see mismatched teeth.",
    "Squinting, he asked me",
    "to turn toward the light",
    "as he held an unglazed crown",
    "by my upper incisors.",
    "With a small brush he applied",
    "yellow, gray, pink, violet",
    "and green from a palette of glazes,",
    "then fired it at sixteen hundred",
    "degrees. We went outside",
    "to check the final color,",
    "and he was pleased. Today",
    "the dentist put it in my mouth,",
    "and no one could ever guess",
    "my secret: there\u2019s no one quite",
    "like me, and I can prove it",
    "by the unique shade of",
    "the ivory sculptures attached",
    "to bony sockets in my jaw.",
    "A gallery opens when I smile.",
    "Even the forgery gleams."
