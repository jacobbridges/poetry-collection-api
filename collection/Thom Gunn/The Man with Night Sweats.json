    "I wake up cold, I who",
    "Prospered through dreams of heat",
    "Wake to their residue,",
    "Sweat, and a clinging sheet.",
    "My flesh was its own shield:",
    "Where it was gashed, it healed.",
    "I grew as I explored",
    "The body I could trust",
    "Even while I adored",
    "The risk that made robust,",
    "A world of wonders in",
    "Each challenge to the skin.",
    "I cannot but be sorry",
    "The given shield was cracked,",
    "My mind reduced to hurry,",
    "My flesh reduced and wrecked.",
    "I have to change the bed,",
    "But catch myself instead",
    "Stopped upright where I am",
    "Hugging my body to me",
    "As if to shield it from",
    "The pains that will go through me,",
    "As if hands were enough",
    "To hold an avalanche off."
