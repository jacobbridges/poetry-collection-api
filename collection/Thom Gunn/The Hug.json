    "It was your birthday, we had drunk and dined",
    "Half of the night with our old friend",
    "Who'd showed us in the end",
    "To a bed I reached in one drunk stride.",
    "Already I lay snug,",
    "And drowsy with the wine dozed on one side.",
    "I dozed, I slept. My sleep broke on a hug,",
    "Suddenly, from behind,",
    "In which the full lengths of our bodies pressed:",
    "Your instep to my heel,",
    "My shoulder-blades against your chest.",
    "It was not sex, but I could feel",
    "The whole strength of your body set,",
    "Or braced, to mine,",
    "And locking me to you",
    "As if we were still twenty-two",
    "When our grand passion had not yet",
    "Become familial.",
    "My quick sleep had deleted all",
    "Of intervening time and place.",
    "I only knew",
    "The stay of your secure firm dry embrace."
