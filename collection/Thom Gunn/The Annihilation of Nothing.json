    "Nothing remained: Nothing, the wanton name",
    "That nightly I rehearsed till led away",
    "To a dark sleep, or sleep that held one dream.",
    "In this a huge contagious absence lay,",
    "More space than space, over the cloud and slime,",
    "Defined but by the encroachments of its sway.",
    "Stripped to indifference at the turns of time,",
    "Whose end I knew, I woke without desire,",
    "And welcomed zero as a paradigm.",
    "But now it breaks\u2014images burst with fire",
    "Into the quiet sphere where I have bided,",
    "Showing the landscape holding yet entire:",
    "The power that I envisaged, that presided",
    "Ultimate in its abstract devastations,",
    "Is merely change, the atoms it divided",
    "Complete, in ignorance, new combinations.",
    "Only an infinite finitude I see",
    "In those peculiar lovely variations.",
    "It is despair that nothing cannot be",
    "Flares in the mind and leaves a smoky mark",
    "Of dread.",
    "Look upward. Neither firm nor free,",
    "Purposeless matter hovers in the dark."
