    "The snail pushes through a green",
    "night, for the grass is heavy",
    "with water and meets over",
    "the bright path he makes, where rain",
    "has darkened the earth\u2019s dark. He",
    "moves in a wood of desire,",
    "pale antlers barely stirring",
    "as he hunts. I cannot tell",
    "what power is at work, drenched there",
    "with purpose, knowing nothing.",
    "What is a snail\u2019s fury? All",
    "I think is that if later",
    "I parted the blades above",
    "the tunnel and saw the thin",
    "trail of broken white across",
    "litter, I would never have",
    "imagined the slow passion",
    "to that deliberate progress."
