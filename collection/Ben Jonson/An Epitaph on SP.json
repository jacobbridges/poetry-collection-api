    "'Twas a child, that so did thrive",
    "In grace and feature,",
    "As heaven and nature seem'd to strive",
    "Which own'd the creature.",
    "Years he number'd scarce thirteen",
    "When fates turn'd cruel,",
    "Yet three fill'd zodiacs had he been",
    "The stage's jewel;",
    "And did act (what now we moan)",
    "Old men so duly,",
    "As, sooth, the Parc\u00e6 thought him one,",
    "He play'd so truly.",
    "So, by error, to his fate",
    "They all consented;",
    "But viewing him since (alas, too late)",
    "They have repented;",
    "And have sought (to give new birth)",
    "In baths to steep him;",
    "But being so much too good for earth,",
    "Heaven vows to keep him."
