    "Donne, the delight of Phoebus and each Muse",
    "Who, to thy one, all other brains refuse;",
    "Whose every work of thy most early wit",
    "Came forth example, and remains so yet;",
    "Longer a-knowing than most wits do live;",
    "And which no affection praise enough can give!",
    "To it, thy language, letters, arts, best life,",
    "Which might with half mankind maintain a strife.",
    "All which I meant to praise, and yet I would;",
    "But leave, because I cannot as I should!"
