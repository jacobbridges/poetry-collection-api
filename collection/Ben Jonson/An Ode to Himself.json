    "Where dost thou careless lie,",
    "Buried in ease and sloth?",
    "Knowledge that sleeps doth die;",
    "And this security,",
    "It is the common moth",
    "That eats on wits and arts, and oft destroys them both.",
    "Are all th' Aonian springs",
    "Dried up? lies Thespia waste?",
    "Doth Clarius' harp want strings,",
    "That not a nymph now sings?",
    "Or droop they as disgrac'd,",
    "To see their seats and bowers by chatt'ring pies defac'd?",
    "If hence thy silence be,",
    "As 'tis too just a cause,",
    "Let this thought quicken thee:",
    "Minds that are great and free",
    "Should not on fortune pause;",
    "'Tis crown enough to virtue still, her own applause.",
    "What though the greedy fry",
    "Be taken with false baites",
    "Of worded balladry,",
    "And think it poesy?",
    "They die with their conceits,",
    "And only piteous scorn upon their folly waits.",
    "Then take in hand thy lyre,",
    "Strike in thy proper strain,",
    "With Japhet's line aspire",
    "Sol's chariot for new fire,",
    "To give the world again;",
    "Who aided him will thee, the issue of Jove's brain.",
    "And since our dainty age",
    "Cannot endure reproof,",
    "Make not thyself a page",
    "To that strumpet, the stage,",
    "But sing high and aloof,",
    "Safe from the wolf's black jaw and the dull ass's hoof."
