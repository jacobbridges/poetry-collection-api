    "Whose poems would not wish to be your book?",

    "Crown with their own. Rare poems ask rare friends.",
    "Yet satires, since the most of mankind be",
    "Their unavoided subject, fewest see;",
    "For none e'er took that pleasure in sin's sense",
    "But, when they heard it tax'd, took more offence.",
    "They, then, that living where the matter is bred,",
    "Dare for these poems, yet, both ask and read",
    "And like them too, must needfully, though few,",
    "Be of the best; and 'mongst those best are you,",
    "Lucy, you brightness of our sphere, who are",
    "The Muses' evening, as their morning star."
