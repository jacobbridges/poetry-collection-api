    "1",
    "In the region of rain and cloud,",
    "I live in shade,",
    "under the moss mat of days bruised",
    "purple with desire.",
    "My dominion is a song in the wide ring of water.",
    "There, I run to and fro,",
    "braiding the logical act",
    "in the birth of an Ear of Corn,",
    "polychromatic story I will now tell",
    "in the weaving, power's form in motion,",
    "a devotion to the unstressed.",
    "Once, I wreathed around a king,",
    "became a fishing net, a maze",
    "\u201ca deadly wealth of robe.\u201d",
    "Mothers who have heard me sing take heart;",
    "I always prick them into power.",
    "2",
    "(I lift the red flower of winter into the wind.)",
    "I",
    "Out of the ninth circle,",
    "a Phoenician boat rocks upward into light",
    "and the warmth of a name\u2014given to heaven\u2014",
    "that arises in the ninth realm.",
    "Earth's realm discloses the Egyptian",
    "on the point of invention,",
    "deprived of life and death,",
    "heart deep in the soul's hawk,",
    "a thymos shadow knapping the tombed body.",
    "Some one or thing is always heaven bound.",
    "Some flowered log doubles my bones.",
    "The spirit of Toltec turtledoves escapes.",
    "A sharp, metaphorical cry sends me",
    "into the adorned sepulchre,",
    "and the thing that decays learns",
    "how to speak its name.",
    "L",
    "Down Hidalgo,",
    "past Alvarado and Basurto,",
    "I walk a straight line",
    "to the snailed Pasco Los Berros.",
    "Here, at noon, the sun,",
    "a silver bead,",
    "veils what the dawn has displayed.",
    "Even so,",
    "I have taken up the morning's bond again",
    "\u2014the lake with its pendulum leg",
    "shining in the distance,",
    "the boy in white",
    "hauling his bottle of chalky milk home.",
    "I know I sit in the deep of a city",
    "with its brocade of hills,",
    "where a thin rain is an evening's fire.",
    "I have heard the women sing",
    "near their gas lamps,",
    "when the rose end of day lights a hunger",
    "for the garlanded soups and meat they prepare.",
    "Often, I have taken the high ground",
    "by the pond, over a frog's voice",
    "dampened by lilies,",
    "and been exalted by the soothsayer",
    "who knows I'm not at home.",
    "I am the arcane body,",
    "raised at the ninth hour,",
    "to be welcomed by the moonlight",
    "of such spirited air.",
    "I am the Dane of degrees",
    "who realizes how the spirit glows",
    "even as it descends.",
    "R",
    "The heart, catalectic though it be, does glow,",
    "responds to every midnight bell within you.",
    "This is a discourse on reading heat,",
    "the flushed char of burned moments one sees",
    "after the sexton's lamp flows",
    "over the body's dark book.",
    "There is suspicion",
    "here that violet",
    "traces of",
    "sacrifice",
    "stand",
    "bare.",
    "F",
    "This marble dust recalls that sunset",
    "with the best burgundy, and the way,",
    "after the charm of it, the peacocks",
    "escaped their cages on the green.",
    "I would now embellish the flame",
    "that ornaments you,",
    "even as it once in that moment",
    "did.",
    "I carry you blossomed,",
    "cream and salt of a high crown.",
    "You",
    "flare,",
    "stream forth,",
    "blister and scale me,",
    "even as you structure the enveloping kiss,",
    "sporophore of our highest loss.",
    "W",
    "Under the evergreens,",
    "the grouse have gone under the snow.",
    "Women who follow their fall flight",
    "tell us that, if you listen, you can hear",
    "their dove's voices ridge the air,",
    "a singing that follows us to a bourne",
    "released from its heat sleep.",
    "We have come to an imagined line,",
    "celestial,",
    "that binds us to the burr of a sheltered thing",
    "and rings us with a fire that will not dance,",
    "in a horn that will not sound.",
    "We have learned, like these birds,",
    "to publish our decline,",
    "when over knotted apples and straw-crisp leaves,",
    "the slanted sun welcomes us once again",
    "to the arrested music in the earth's divided embrace.",
    "W",
    "Through winter,",
    "harmattan blacks the air.",
    "My body fat with oil,",
    "I become another star at noon,",
    "when the vatic insistence",
    "of the dog star's breath clings to me.",
    "Though I am a woman,",
    "I turn south,",
    "toward the fire,",
    "and hear the spirits in the bush.",
    "But this is my conceit:",
    "water will come from the west,",
    "and I will have my trance,",
    "be reborn,",
    "perhaps in a Mediterranean air,",
    "the Rhone delta's contention",
    "with the eastern side of rain.",
    "In all these disguises,",
    "I follow the aroma of power.",
    "So I am charged in my own field,",
    "to give birth to the solar wind,",
    "particles spiraling around the line",
    "of my body,",
    "moving toward the disruption,",
    "the moment when the oil of my star at noon",
    "is a new dawn.",
    "3",
    "I shall go away, I shall disappear,",
    "I shall be stretched on a bed of yellow roses",
    "and the old women will cry for me.",
    "So the Toltecas wrote: their books are finished,",
    "but your heart has become perfect."
