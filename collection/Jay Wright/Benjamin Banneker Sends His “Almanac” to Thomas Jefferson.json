    "Old now,",
    "your eyes nearly blank",
    "from plotting the light's",
    "movement over the years,",
    "you clean your",
    "and place it next",
    "to the heart of this letter.",
    "I have you in mind,",
    "giving a final brush and twist",
    "to the difficult pages,",
    "staring down the shape of the numbers",
    "as though you would find a flaw",
    "in their forms.",
    "Solid, these calculations",
    "verify your body on God's earth.",
    "At night,",
    "the stars submit themselves",
    "to the remembered way you turn them;",
    "the moon gloats under your attention.",
    "I, who know so little of stars,",
    "whose only acquaintance with the moon",
    "is to read a myth, or to listen",
    "to the surge",
    "of songs the women know,",
    "sit in your marvelous reading",
    "of all movement,",
    "of all relations.",
    "So you look into what we see",
    "yet cannot see,",
    "and shape and take a language",
    "to give form to one or the other,",
    "believing no form will escape,",
    "no movement appear, nor stop,",
    "without explanation,",
    "believing no reason is only reason,",
    "nor without reason.",
    "I read all of this into your task,",
    "all of this into the uneasy",
    "reproof of your letter.",
    "Surely, there must be a flaw.",
    "These perfect calculations fall apart.",
    "There are silences",
    "that no perfect number can retrieve,",
    "omissions no perfect line could catch.",
    "How could a man but challenge God's",
    "impartial distributions?",
    "How could a man sit among",
    "the free and ordered movements",
    "of stars, and waters, beasts and birds,",
    "each movement seen or accounted for,",
    "and not know God jealous,",
    "and not know that he himself must be?",
    "So you go over the pages again,",
    "looking for the one thing",
    "that will not reveal itself,",
    "judging what you have received,",
    "what you have shaped,",
    "believing it cannot be strange",
    "to the man you address.",
    "But you are strange to him",
    "\u2014your skin, your tongue,",
    "the movement of your body,",
    "even your mysterious ways with stars.",
    "You argue here with the man and God,",
    "and know that no man can be right,",
    "and know that no God will argue right.",
    "Your letter turns on what the man knows,",
    "on what God, you think, would have us know.",
    "All stars will forever move under your gaze,",
    "truthfully, leading you from line to line,",
    "from number to number, from truth to truth,",
    "while the man will read your soul's desire,",
    "searcher, searching yourself,",
    "losing the relations."
