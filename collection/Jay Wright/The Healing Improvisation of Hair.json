    "If you undo your do you would",
    "be strange. Hair has been on my mind.",
    "I used to lean in the doorway",
    "and watch my stony woman wind",
    "the copper through the black, and play",
    "with my understanding, show me she c\u00f3uld",
    "take a cup of river water,",
    "and watch it shimmy, watch it change,",
    "turn around and become ash bone.",
    "Wind in the cottonwoods wakes me",
    "to a day so thin its breastbone",
    "shows, so paid out it shakes me free",
    "of its blue dust. I will arrange",
    "that river water, bottom juice.",
    "I conjure my head in the stream",
    "and ride with the silk feel of it",
    "as my woman bathes me, and shaves",
    "away the scorn, sponges the grit",
    "of solitude from my skin, laves",
    "the salt water of self-esteem",
    "over my feathering body.",
    "How like joy to come upon me",
    "in remembering a head of hair",
    "and the way water would caress",
    "it, and stress beauty in the flair",
    "and cut of the only witness",
    "to my dance under sorrow's tree.",
    "This swift darkness is spring's first hour.",
    "I carried my life, like a stone,",
    "in a ragged pocket, but I",
    "had a true weaving song, a sly",
    "way with rhythm, a healing tone."
