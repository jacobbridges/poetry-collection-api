    "The trees are crystal chandeliers,",
    "and deep in the hollow",
    "a child pits its voice",
    "against the rain.",
    "The city screams its prayers",
    "at the towers in the distance.",
    "Those guitars again.",
    "And the Catholic mantis",
    "clutching at the sky,",
    "a pearl of a city,",
    "cuando se duerme.",
    "Subway blue boys",
    "now ride shotgun",
    "against my freedom and my fears.",
    "Pistols snap like indignant heels,",
    "at midday, and we stand at the docks,",
    "singing a farewell we'd soon forget.",
    "Hymns resound against that dome",
    "entre la fiesta y la agonia.",
    "Worms feed on its concrete,",
    "or we pluck them out of bodies.",
    "But time to forget.",
    "Or remember the easiness",
    "of leaving easy loves,",
    "disappearing",
    "in the arms of secret dreams.",
    "We'll sit at the end",
    "of a banquet board,",
    "and powder our tutored wigs,",
    "flip the pages of gentility",
    "in the rainy season.",
    "English lessons over tea",
    "for the price of memory.",
    "Il mio supplizio",
    "\u00e8 quando",
    "non mi credo",
    "in armonia.",
    "They say the time",
    "is not much different.",
    "The strange and customary turns",
    "of living may coincide.",
    "In Mariachi Plaza",
    "travelers sing elegies to the beauty",
    "of revolutions and tranquillity.",
    "From the opposite side of the river,",
    "coming in, the skyline seems scrubbed",
    "and pointed ominously into the darkness.",
    "I walk through the market,",
    "kissing colors in a murmur",
    "of self-induced petition.",
    "Two spires,",
    "lying against the night,",
    "are suddenly armed to sail.",
    "The water foams against the bottom,",
    "the way it looked when I left",
    "that dying city",
    "Only a turning to feel the bark",
    "slope off into the night,",
    "with a promise to return.",
    "Un di, s'io non andr\u00f2 sempre fuggendo",
    "di gente in gente, mi vedrai seduto",
    "su la tua pietra, o fratel mio, gemendo",
    "it fior dei tuoi gentili anni caduto.",
    "From line to line,",
    "from point to point,",
    "is an architect's end of cities.",
    "But I lie down",
    "to a different turbulence",
    "and a plan of transformation."
