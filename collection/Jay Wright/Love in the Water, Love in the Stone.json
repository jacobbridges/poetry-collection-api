    "Faithful bean lady of the plantain,",
    "your tubular beads surround my voice.",
    "You bring me a berry song so old",
    "I hug the silences. You",
    "embrace the silence and the clear light",
    "on the track of your quest, to here.",
    "I see now in that light myself",
    "into the tangle of the river\u2019s bottom.",
    "Knee-deep in another\u2019s bliss",
    "I wake and find myself a stone",
    "at your lover\u2019s feet.",
    "Then stone upon stone,",
    "I rise into another\u2019s fire.",
    "I touch your palm oil flesh",
    "to light me from my cave.",
    "And, if I rise, under your thunder,",
    "into rain, I praise your touch.",
    "Now, a life-long a laterite,",
    "a rain of beads, palm kernel oil",
    "stipulate my clipped time.",
    "The earth weaves eight gold bridal veils",
    "to cast into the sea. The moon",
    "is up at noon to catch me naked,",
    "drunk and dancing with a ram.",
    "I use the loom of seasons so;",
    "I abuse myself.",
    "And, even if I leave you,",
    "I marry your worship in my wife\u2019s voice.",
    "I begin the decline of having you",
    "close;",
    "your memories feed me.",
    "These are my intolerable survivals.",
    "And so I take my love\u2019s journey",
    "from the language of your needs.",
    "I mount my woman\u2019s earth smell",
    "in the shadows of your ageless eyes.",
    "I crawl to the altar of your thunderstones",
    "and bleed for the bride whose blood",
    "will fill my name."
