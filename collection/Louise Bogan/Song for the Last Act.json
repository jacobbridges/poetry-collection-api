    "Now that I have your face by heart, I look",
    "Less at its features than its darkening frame",
    "Where quince and melon, yellow as young flame,",
    "Lie with quilled dahlias and the shepherd\u2019s crook.",
    "Beyond, a garden. There, in insolent ease",
    "The lead and marble figures watch the show",
    "Of yet another summer loath to go",
    "Although the scythes hang in the apple trees.",
    "Now that I have your face by heart, I look.",
    "Now that I have your voice by heart, I read",
    "In the black chords upon a dulling page",
    "Music that is not meant for music\u2019s cage,",
    "Whose emblems mix with words that shake and bleed.",
    "The staves are shuttled over with a stark",
    "Unprinted silence. In a double dream",
    "I must spell out the storm, the running stream.",
    "The beat\u2019s too swift. The notes shift in the dark.",
    "Now that I have your voice by heart, I read.",
    "Now that I have your heart by heart, I see",
    "The wharves with their great ships and architraves;",
    "The rigging and the cargo and the slaves",
    "On a strange beach under a broken sky.",
    "O not departure, but a voyage done!",
    "The bales stand on the stone; the anchor weeps",
    "Its red rust downward, and the long vine creeps",
    "Beside the salt herb, in the lengthening sun.",
    "Now that I have your heart by heart, I see."
