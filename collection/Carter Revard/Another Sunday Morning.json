    "What I walked down to the highway for,",
    "through the summer dawn,",
    "was the Sunday funnies,",
    "or so I thought\u2014",
    "but what I remember reading there",
    "in the shadowless light",
    "among meadowlarks singing",
    "was tracks in the deep warm dust",
    "of the lane, where it parted",
    "with its beige dryness the meadow\u2019s dew\u2014",
    "the sleek trail where a snake had crossed",
    "and slid into tall grass;",
    "the stippled parallels",
    "with marks between them where",
    "a black blister-beetle had dragged",
    "its bulbous belly across",
    "in search of weeds more green;",
    "the labyrinth of lacelike",
    "dimples left by a speed-freak",
    "tiger-beetles\u2019s sprints that ended",
    "where it took wing",
    "with a little blur of dust-grains;",
    "and stepping through the beetle-trails,",
    "the wedge-heels and sharp-clawed hands of skunk-track",
    "crossing unhurried and walking",
    "along the ditch to find",
    "an easy place for climbing;",
    "not far past that,",
    "a line of cat-prints running",
    "straight down the lane and ending",
    "with deep marks where it leaped",
    "across the ditch to the meadow",
    "for birds asleep or wandering baby rabbits:",
    "and freshly placed this morning,",
    "the slender runes",
    "of bob-whites running, scuffles",
    "of dustbaths taken\u2014",
    "and there ahead",
    "crouched low at the lane-edge",
    "under purple pokeweed-berries",
    "four quail had seen me,",
    "and when I walked slowly",
    "on toward them, instead",
    "of flying they ran",
    "with a fluid scuttling",
    "on down the lane and stopped frozen",
    "till I came too close",
    "\u2014then quietly when",
    "I expected an explosion",
    "of wings they took off low and whispering",
    "and sailed, rocking and tilting",
    "out over the meadow\u2019s tall bluestem,",
    "dropped down and were gone until",
    "I heard them whistling, down by the little pond,",
    "and whistled back so sharply",
    "that when I got back to the house",
    "they still were answering",
    "and one flew into the elm",
    "and whistled from its shadows",
    "up over the porch where I sat",
    "reading the funnies while the kittens",
    "played with the headlines",
    "till when the first gold sunlight",
    "tipped the elm\u2019s leaves he flew",
    "back out to the meadow and sank",
    "down into the sun-brilliant dew",
    "on curving wings,",
    "and my brothers and sisters waked",
    "by the whistling came pouring out",
    "onto the porch and claimed their share",
    "of the Sunday funnies\u2014",
    "and I went on to read",
    "the headlines of World War Two,",
    "with maps of the struggling armies leaving",
    "tank-tracks over the dunes of Libya",
    "and the navies churning their wakes",
    "of phosphorescence in the Coral Sea",
    "where the ships went down on fire",
    "and the waves bobbed and flamed",
    "with the maimed survivors , screaming",
    "in Japanese or English until",
    "their gasoline-blistered heads",
    "sank down to the tiger sharks",
    "and the war was lost or won",
    "for children sitting in sunlight,",
    "believing their cause was just",
    "and knowing it would prevail,",
    "as the dew vanished away."
