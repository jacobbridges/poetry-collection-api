    "Brimming the trees with song",
    "they flood July, spill over into",
    "August pulsing lovecries,",
    "cicadas here\u2014one that",
    "our cat brought me lay, legs folded",
    "neatly, on clear wings as on a shroud, green",
    "and white, fizzing now and then,",
    "but when I threw it spread",
    "wings and zagged in a wide curve into",
    "the sweetgum tree where presently",
    "its dry buzzsaw whined for some",
    "significant other to auger down",
    "into dark dense earth and gnaw at",
    "the roots of things,",
    "sans eyes, sans wings, sans",
    "song for seventeen years or so.",
    "As daylight sharpens, deer slip back",
    "into the woods. I wonder what a deer,",
    "when danger grows too bright,",
    "makes of a world whose darker,",
    "truer memories in ear",
    "and nose must solve the dazzle of",
    "our alien eyes, more surgical",
    "at stripping off its cover, at masking selves",
    "as downwind leaves.",
    "I\u2019ve read somewhere the claim, by computer people,",
    "that pain cannot be felt",
    "until self-consciousness",
    "has been achieved, and they had programmed in",
    "that level, so they said, of artificial pain.",
    "In A. R. Luria\u2019s book",
    "of a Mnemonist, the man infallibly",
    "remembered everything, but all perceptions",
    "were unlike ours. Hearing, he tasted: sweet, bitter,",
    "salty; heard neon colors; rough or silky, icy or",
    "bloodwarm words: laid them like eggs aside on streets",
    "his memory walked stolidly along,",
    "walked back to get them when he needed to.",
    "\u2014Forgot, once, a word;",
    "had set it carefully beneath a lamp",
    "whose bulb was burnt out.",
    "Bud opens and",
    "is marigold, bird touched",
    "by sunlight sings,",
    "mind thinks:",
    "I am. Still,",
    "as the old man put it, coming out",
    "into the light we wawl",
    "and cry. I wonder,",
    "in this darklit galaxy,",
    "how that song is heard."
