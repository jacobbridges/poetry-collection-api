    "On humming rubber along this white concrete,",
    "lighthearted between the gravities",
    "of source and destination like a man",
    "halfway to the moon",
    "in this bubble of tuneless whistling",
    "at seventy miles an hour from the windvents,",
    "over prairie swells rising",
    "and falling, over the quick offramp",
    "that drops to its underpass and the truck",
    "thundering beneath as I cross",
    "with the country music twanging out my windows,",
    "I'm grooving down this highway feeling",
    "technology is freedom's other name when",
    "\u2014a meadowlark",
    "comes sailing across my windshield",
    "with breast shining yellow",
    "and five notes pierce",
    "the windroar like a flash",
    "of nectar on mind,",
    "gone as the country music swells up and drops",
    "me wheeling down",
    "my notch of cement-bottomed sky",
    "between home and away",
    "and wanting",
    "to move again through country that a bird",
    "has defined wholly with song,",
    "and maybe next time see how",
    "he flies so easy, when he sings."
