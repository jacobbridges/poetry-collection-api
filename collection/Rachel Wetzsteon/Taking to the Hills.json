    "If walking, like wine, only abets a sad mood",
    "let\u2019s try it, I said, and I did:",
    "over these hills that have never known sorrow",
    "no thoughtful moon passes. Dig until a hill is level, and unearth",
    "only earth. Take pride in knowing the chemical makeup",
    "of rain, the sum total of harmful vapors in any sunset.",
    "For if you must drag in the old lines",
    "about suicidal willows, star\u2019s stacked for or against you,",
    "you clutter a limitless, soaring landscape",
    "with your own baggage. Night of love,",
    "day of omens of night, great mountain",
    "of realized hopes, valley where bitter winds",
    "blow the dispossessed into raving lunatics\u2014",
    "what are they but shady projections",
    "of passing whims, vastly oversimplified versions",
    "of something infinitely greater? This vision before you",
    "is nothing but a triad of trees, hills, river,",
    "steadfast and eternal. But soon you start to feel restless",
    "and when, setting out to take a roll of photos,",
    "you note the disturbing absence of a road,",
    "your suavity crumbles: you deafen the sky",
    "and serenade the moon, fall prostrate before pines",
    "saying oh, come back, spirit of the place which,",
    "lifeless without you, blossoms into something",
    "sumptuously more than mediating madness;",
    "come back, massive oaks that await our coming;",
    "to carve initials is to be truly human;",
    "the days are dappled with our passions,",
    "the mountains rise and fall with our glories and follies."
