    "The park admits the wind,",
    "the petals lift and scatter",
    "like versions of myself I was on the verge",
    "of becoming; and ten years on",
    "and ten blocks down I still can\u2019t tell",
    "whether this dispersal resembles",
    "a fist unclenching or waving goodbye.",
    "But the petals scatter faster,",
    "seeking the rose, the cigarette vendor,",
    "and at least I\u2019ve got by pumping heart",
    "some rules of conduct: refuse to choose",
    "between turning pages and turning heads",
    "though the stubborn dine alone. Get over",
    "\u201cgetting over\u201d: darks clouds don\u2019t fade",
    "but drift with ever deeper colors.",
    "Give up on rooted happiness",
    "(the stolid trees on fire!) and sweet reprieve",
    "(a poor park but my own) will follow.",
    "There is still a chance the empty gazebo",
    "will draw crowds from the greater world.",
    "And meanwhile, meanwhile\u2019s far from nothing:",
    "the humming moment, the rustle of cherry trees."
