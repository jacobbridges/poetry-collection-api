    "The world had fled, with all its silly cares",
    "and questionable aches, and in one swoon",
    "we rose above its stupefying airs",
    "like flying lovesick pigs up to the moon.",
    "In that blue light where two lives equaled all,",
    "our souls looked down upon a spinning ball.",
    "The world returned, and this was a surprise",
    "I raged against like someone on a rack,",
    "telling the sun, tears clouding my stunned eyes,",
    "give us our splendid isolation back.",
    "I craved third rails, a shot of something strong",
    "when I found out it doesn\u2019t last for long.",
    "The world came back and stayed, pain never ended,",
    "but when the aches and cares begged for a hand,",
    "grew softer in the light we\u2019d made and tended,",
    "I finally began to understand",
    "love\u2019s widening third stage, and of the three",
    "this was the most outstanding ecstasy."
