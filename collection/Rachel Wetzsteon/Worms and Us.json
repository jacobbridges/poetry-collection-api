    "Maggots in the food, maggots in the floorboards,",
    "maggots in the recurring nightmare in which,",
    "lying down with a rugged adonis,",
    "I wake to find him almost nibbled away.",
    "Certainly signs of death are everywhere,",
    "but love is more than combat with worms",
    "and cannot be so glibly explained away;",
    "I do not tremble or knock my knees",
    "to keep the maggots slumbering below ground,",
    "or crush them underfoot by flocking to",
    "everything they are not: raucous gatherings,",
    "stolen kisses. On the contrary,",
    "I come away from parties adoring",
    "what is wormlike in them: the unrisen souffl\u00e9,",
    "the precocious boy\u2019s octogenarian sayings,",
    "the drooping lids of the hostess, someone\u2019s",
    "death rattle of a laugh. Certainly love has",
    "commerce with vermin, but it is a friendly",
    "partnership, not a league of discord;",
    "a hacking cough gives proof of a full life,",
    "a passing stranger seems all the stronger",
    "when one foot is sinking quietly into the grave.",
    "But is is this lingering horror of dust",
    "that makes me pull us out of the cold earth",
    "any way I know how: because I strive",
    "for heaven in little rooms, visit you",
    "in order to suck your blood, then spread it",
    "over pipes and daffodils, and shove you",
    "up to the vacant sky, where you hover",
    "like a stone-cold, tedious statue who never dies,",
    "you, poor pawn, are a jack-in-the-box gone haywire,",
    "and I am a grinning humanist with bad dreams."
