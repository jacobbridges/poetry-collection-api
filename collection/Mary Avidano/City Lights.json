    "My father, rather a quiet man,",
    "told a story only the one time,",
    "if even then\u2014he had so little",
    "need, it seemed, of being understood.",
    "Intervals of years, his silences!",
    "Late in his life he recalled for us",
    "that when he was sixteen, his papa",
    "entrusted to him a wagonload",
    "of hogs, which he was to deliver",
    "to the train depot, a half-day\u2019s ride",
    "from home, over a hilly dirt road.",
    "Lightly he held the reins, light his heart,",
    "the old horses, as ever, willing.",
    "In town at noon he heard the station-",
    "master say the train had been delayed,",
    "would not arrive until that evening.",
    "The boy could only wait. At home they\u2019d",
    "wait for him and worry and would place",
    "the kerosene lamp in the window.",
    "Thus the day had turned to dusk before",
    "he turned about the empty wagon,",
    "took his weary horses through the cloud",
    "of fireflies that was the little town.",
    "In all his years he\u2019d never seen those",
    "lights\u2014he thought of this, he said, until",
    "he and his milk-white horses came down",
    "the last moonlit hill to home, drawn as",
    "from a distance toward a single flame."
