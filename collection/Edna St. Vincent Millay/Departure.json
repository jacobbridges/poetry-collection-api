    "It's little I care what path I take,",
    "And where it leads it's little I care;",
    "But out of this house, lest my heart break,",
    "I must go, and off somewhere.",
    "It's little I know what's in my heart,",
    "What's in my mind it's little I know,",
    "But there's that in me must up and start,",
    "And it's little I care where my feet go.",
    "I wish I could walk for a day and a night,",
    "And find me at dawn in a desolate place",
    "With never the rut of a road in sight,",
    "Nor the roof of a house, nor the eyes of a face.",
    "I wish I could walk till my blood should spout,",
    "And drop me, never to stir again,",
    "On a shore that is wide, for the tide is out,",
    "And the weedy rocks are bare to the rain.",
    "But dump or dock, where the path I take",
    "Brings up, it's little enough I care;",
    "And it's little I'd mind the fuss they'll make,",
    "Huddled dead in a ditch somewhere."
