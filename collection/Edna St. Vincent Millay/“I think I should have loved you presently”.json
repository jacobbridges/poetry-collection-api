    "I think I should have loved you presently,",
    "And given in earnest words I flung in jest;",
    "And lifted honest eyes for you to see,",
    "And caught your hand against my cheek and breast;",
    "And all my pretty follies flung aside",
    "That won you to me, and beneath your gaze,",
    "Naked of reticence and shorn of pride,",
    "Spread like a chart my little wicked ways.",
    "I, that had been to you, had you remained,",
    "But one more waking from a recurrent dream,",
    "Cherish no less the certain stakes I gained,",
    "And walk your memory\u2019s halls, austere, supreme,",
    "A ghost in marble of a girl you knew",
    "Who would have loved you in a day or two."
