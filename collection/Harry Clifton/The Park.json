    "Because anyone sitting still attracts desire,",
    "Even this will not be given you, the park",
    "In June, the silence of a bench at eleven o\u2019clock",
    "On a Monday morning, or four on a Thursday afternoon.",
    "Someone will drift toward you, unattached",
    "And lonely. The spell will be broken, the wrong word said.",
    "It is cool, but there is no death in the few token leaves",
    "That must have come down last night, in the rain that freshened,",
    "The tree-smell that remains. For this season there is no name,",
    "Not summer, and none of the months of the year\u2014",
    "A something inside you. Search your mind",
    "For the green arboriferous Word the boys and girls swing out of",
    "Like a tree, and the lovers",
    "On the grass in tantric mode, in an ecstasy",
    "Of untouching, and the human buddhas, legs infolded, reading.",
    "Branches, sheer translucent leaves\u2014",
    "You would die to get under them forever, if it were given you,",
    "The park, on this, a day like any other day,",
    "And not the knowledge of everyone ever met",
    "Who will come upon you, sooner or later,",
    "If only you stay here. No, not people, or the walkways",
    "Made in another century, or the murmur of the great city",
    "Everywhere in the distance, but this breathing-space",
    "Where the void no longer terrible",
    "But to be relaxed in, the depressions",
    "Which anyway here are mild, incoming from the west,",
    "Slow-acting, chronic, lifelong not acute",
    "Are there to be sat through, waited out",
    "On a damp bench, as a man sweeps up around you",
    "And the sun comes out in real time, stealing over the ground."
