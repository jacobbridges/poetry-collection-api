    "It was there, the elemental center,",
    "All the time. Eternally present, repeating itself",
    "Like seasons, where the times and dates",
    "For swallows and household fires are written down,",
    "The grouse are counted, the quotas of stocked rainbows.",
    "All that love of order, for its own sake.",
    "Only the hill-farms, and the high sheep country",
    "Above politics\u2014the enormous relief",
    "Up there, as the dialect names of skies",
    "Return, along with their clouds, and the old knowledge",
    "Opens the mind again. To dream, to just potter",
    "In the yard, to fiddle with local stations",
    "In the kitchen, where news that is no news",
    "Finally, at last, fills up the years",
    "With pure existence. Lit from beneath",
    "The fields are evenings long, the tree by the house",
    "Where Vladimir and Estragon kept vigil",
    "With the stillness of commando and insurgent",
    "Frightens no one. Slow through the air",
    "A heron, shouldering aside the weight of the world,",
    "Is making for its colonies, coevals",
    "In a state plantation . . .",
    "Nowhere but here",
    "In the high right hand of Ireland, do the weather fronts",
    "Give way so slowly, to such ambivalent light."
