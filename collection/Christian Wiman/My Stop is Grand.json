    "I have no illusion",
    "some fusion",
    "of force and form",
    "will save me,",
    "bewilderment",
    "of bonelight",
    "ungrave me",
    "as when the El",
    "shooting through a hell",
    "of ratty alleys",
    "where nothing thrives",
    "but soot",
    "and the ratlike lives",
    "that have learned to eat it",
    "screechingly peacocked",
    "a grace of sparks",
    "so far out and above",
    "the fast curve that jostled",
    "and fastened us",
    "into a single shock of\u2014",
    "I will not call it love",
    "but at least some brief",
    "and no doubt illusionary belief",
    "that in one surge of brain",
    "we were all seeing",
    "one thing:",
    "a lone unearned loveliness",
    "struck from an iron pain.",
    "Already it was gone.",
    "Already it was bone,",
    "the gray sky",
    "and the encroaching skyline",
    "pecked so clean",
    "by raptor night",
    "I shuddered at the cold gleam",
    "we hurtled toward",
    "like some insentient herd",
    "plunging underground at Clark",
    "and Division.",
    "And yet all that day",
    "I had a kind of vision",
    "that's never gone completely away",
    "of immense clear-paned towers",
    "and endlessly expendable hours",
    "through which I walked",
    "teeming human streets,",
    "filled with a shine",
    "that was most intimately me",
    "and not mine."
