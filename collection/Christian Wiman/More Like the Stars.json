    "Sometimes amid the rancid moonlight and mindlice of my insomnia",
    "there gleams a scalpel blade",
    "so clean with meaning",
    "so shaped and sharpened to interstellar blue",
    "that drawing it \u2014in season due \u2014",
    "across my own throat",
    "there comes not blood but an ancient answering",
    "starlight.",
    "Once upon a time in a pleasingly modern slaughterhospice",
    "with a view of sky-contempted skyscrapers",
    "and Lake Michigan's immaculate sewage",
    "my inner skin was skinned mouth to bowels,",
    "my soul \u2014deadword, die to find it.",
    "For self-pity there must remain a self.",
    "Ah, but even shitting one's self",
    "one still finds one's self hastening to hide it all",
    "from the kind Ukranian nearly bearded night nurse.",
    "Fentanyl patches patching my stalactite thighs",
    "my diaphanous shoulders",
    "the very air eating me",

    "into a poem.",
    "Dead brain, living will, little pills",

    "of hell . . .",
    "Lovely Leila,",
    "so unsurgically curved,",
    "disclosing as she leans to clean my lines",
    "a bit of icelace undergarment like the very last trace",
    "of a glacier.",

    "of creation's finest failure:",
    "moonskin to make a young man wince",
    "coupled with stifling innocence.",
    "Still, we managed.",

    "her, we improved.",
    "And later, out on a green (to be sixteen!)",
    "when the starshower I thought was mine",
