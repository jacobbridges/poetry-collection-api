    "1.",
    "There is a word that is not water,",
    "has nothing to do with heat or light,",
    "is unrelated to any one pain",
    "though the torn body tears itself further",
    "trying to speak it.",
    "There is a sound",
    "beyond all the sounds that I have made,",
    "the needs that one by one I've tried to name.",
    "It burns clear in the eyes searching mine,",
    "the lips beginning to bleed again,",
    "her hand squeezing my hand,",
    "pleading and pleading that I understand.",
    "2.",
    "All afternoon in the afterlife",
    "of little things that love,",
    "or pain, or need could not let go of",
    "I hunt for the will",
    "that will let me let you go.",
    "I am distracted and slow\u2014",
    "all the grainy faces",
    "in old photographs, letters",
    "from the dead, deeds to places",
    "that are only air,",
    "some bright nowhere",
    "of broad fields and sunlight",
    "that was my idea of heaven",
    "one long afternoon",
    "of clouds and steady rain",
    "when you sat and explained",
    "where a garden was, a well,",
    "excited by it, the hell",
    "ahead of you",
    "just a brief tightness at your heart.",
    "Outside in the yard, crickets start,",
    "cry",
    "and",
    "and",
    "night's thousand shadows growing tall.",
    "And now I have it, formal, final.",
    "I touch each keepsake like a wall.",
    "3.",
    "In the hard light and hum",
    "of the room to which I've come",
    "to stay, I watch the clock,",
    "and wait, and hour by hour",
    "begin to disappear.",
    "Movements, mutterings: the brain",
    "darkens like a landscape. Pain",
    "in the pale arterial hills",
    "flashes and vanishes,",
    "takes with it one whole year.",
    "Cotton and killdeer, a cloud",
    "looks down, something's happened",
    "in the wellhouse, someone runs",
    "through tall trees, breathe and breathe,",
    "is it my hand you hold?",
    "The fever climbs. You grow cold,",
    "then warm, now cold again,",
    "a hive of nerves in the skin.",
    "Some glimmer breaks through",
    "and I bend whispering as fear",
    "like a wind shakes you,",
    "..",
    "Midnight, moonlight gauzing",
    "the walls, the iron and umber",
    "of intensive care:",
    "I watch as it swells and falls",
    "the puttied scar at your heart,",
    "and read each beat and falter",
    "on a screen and match my breathing",
    "to the breathing of a machine",
    "to know this time as it passes,",
    "each moment as it goes\u2014",
    "until, early, you shudder",
    "and quieten, blood gases",
    "begin to rapidly rise",
    "and somewhere behind your eyes",
    "I fall in fragments away:",
    "a child surprised at his play,",
    "encroached upon by air,",
    "a shattered man near dawn,",
    "something about the way",
    "he holds so still, his hair."
