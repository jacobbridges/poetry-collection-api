    ", she called it, gentling grease",
    "over blanching yolks with an expertise",
    "honed from three decades of dawns",
    "at the Longhorn Diner in Loraine,",
    "where even the oldest in the old men's booth",
    "swore as if it were scripture truth",
    "they'd never had a breakfast better,",
    "rapping a glass sharply to get her",
    "attention when it went sorrowing",
    "so far into some simple thing\u2014",
    "the jangly door or a crusted pan,",
    "the wall clock's black, hitchy hands\u2014",
    "that she would startle, blink, then grin",
    "as if discovering them all again.",
    "Who remembers now when one died",
    "the space that he had occupied",
    "went unfilled for a day, then two, three,",
    "until she unceremoniously",
    "plunked plates down in the wrong places",
    "and stared their wronged faces",
    "back to banter she could hardly follow.",
    "Unmarried, childless, homely, \"slow,\"",
    "she knew coffee cut with chamomile",
    "kept the grocer Paul's ulcer cool,",
    "yarrow in gravy eased the islands",
    "of lesions in Larry Borwick's hands,",
    "and when some nightlong nameless urgency",
    "sent him seeking human company",
    "Brother Tom needed hash browns with cheese.",
    "She knew to nod at the litany of cities",
    "the big-rig long-haulers bragged her past,",
    "to laugh when the hunters asked",
    "if she'd pray for them or for the quail",
    "they went laughing off to kill,",
    "and then\u2014envisioning one",
    "rising so fast it seemed the sun",
    "tugged at it\u2014to do exactly that.",
    "Who remembers where they all sat:",
    "crook-backed builders, drought-faced farmers,",
    "VF'ers muttering through their wars,",
    "night-shift roughnecks so caked in black",
    "it seemed they made their way back",
    "every morning from the dead.",
    "Who remembers one word they said?",
    "The Longhorn Diner's long torn down,",
    "the gin and feedlots gone, the town",
    "itself now nothing but a name",
    "at which some bored boy has taken aim,",
    "every letter light-pierced and partial.",
    "Sister, Aunt Sissy, Bera Thrailkill,",
    "I picture you one dime-bright dawn",
    "grown even brighter now for being gone",
    "bustling amid the formica and chrome",
    "of that small house we both called home",
    "during the spring that was your last.",
    "All stories stop: once more you're lost",
    "in something I can merely see:",
    "steam spiriting out of black coffee,",
    "the scorched pores of toast, a bowl",
    "of apple butter like edible soil,",
    "bald cloth, knifelight, the lip of a glass,",
    "my plate's gleaming, teeming emptiness."
