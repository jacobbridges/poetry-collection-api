    "Do you remember the rude nudists?",

    "We were always hiking some hill toward some beauty some",
    "human meanness ruined.",
    "We were always waiting too long to let ourselves be seen.",
    "It was an ocean's gesticulations, articulate elephant seals,",
    "grounded clouds grown all one mouth.",
    "What could we do but laugh,",
    "casting clothes aside as if the air were ice and water a warm bed,",
    "goose-stepping goose-pimpled past their appeased surprise into",
    "the waves.",

    "take a long look",
    "at each other",
    "and creep quietly away."
