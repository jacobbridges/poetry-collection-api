    "Lean and sane",
    "in the last hour",
    "of a long fast",
    "or fiercer discipline",
    "he could touch dust",
    "into a sudden",
    "surge of limbs",
    "and speak leaves",
    "in the night air",
    "above him, inhabit",
    "quiet so wholly",
    "he heard roots",
    "inch into the unfeeling",
    "earth, rings increasing",
    "inside of that tree.",
    "Without moving,",
    "hardly breathing,",
    "he could call",
    "out of the long darkness",
    "walls around him,",
    "a house whose each room",
    "he knew, its hoard",
    "of silences, solitudes,",
    "doors opening",
    "onto the wide fields",
    "through which he moved,",
    "breathing deeply,",
    "unbewildered by the dead",
    "with their hands of wind,",
    "their faces of cloud.",
    "Stilled and gifted",
    "in the last hour",
    "before the first light,",
    "in the dark place",
    "of his own making,",
    "he could feel rocks",
    "relax alive",
    "beside him, gather",
    "from a moon-raveled",
    "river the pearl",
    "curves and blue",
    "fluency of a girl",
    "his hands once knew.",
    "He could let her go.",
    "He let it all go,",
    "desire and grief",
    "and raw need",
    "going out of him",
    "moment by moment",
    "into the mild",
    "immaculate night,",
    "love by love",
    "into a last",
    "passion of pure",
    "attention, nerves,",
    "readiness...",
    "Light carved",
    "out of the darkness",
    "a muscled trunk,",
    "each clenched limb",
    "and the difficult tips",
    "of a plain mesquite",
    "taking shape",
    "over the hard ground",
    "where they found him,",
    "his eyes wide",
    "and his whole body",
    "hungering upward,",
    "as if he could hear",
    "and bear the bird",
    "singing unseen",
    "deep in those leaves."
