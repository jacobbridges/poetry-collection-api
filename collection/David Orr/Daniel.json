    "On the day we moved in, the pings, bumps, and snaps",
    "Were scary, it's true, but probably normal;",
    "A house accepting new patterns of weight",
    "With protest, the way no conviction goes gently.",
    "We laughed a little, and called it \"our spirit.\"",
    "Later that night, when the power conked out",
    "And the kids were crying, the ghost got a name,",
    "\"Daniel,\" and a history of whispered exploits,",
    "All of them harmless, like nursery rhymes,",
    "Or like the little fibs we tell ourselves",
    "To explain why this or that has led to suffering.",
    "Pretty soon, we were using him for everything.",
    "When the Christmas tree fell, it was \"Daniel\";",
    "When my wife lost her ring, it was \"Daniel\";",
    "When the kids forgot to feed the goldfish",
    "And it turned up dead, its eyes silvered over",
    "Like water shadowed under sheets of ice,",
    "Well, that became Daniel too, which was curious;",
    "And pauses me now as I make the long walk",
    "Down the hall to the bathroom in darkness,",
    "And hear, in soft concert, the sound of my footfalls",
    "Answered at once by my children's voices",
    "Still calling to Daniel behind their door."
