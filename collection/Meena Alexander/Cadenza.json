    "I watch your hands at the keyboard",
    "Making music, one hand with a tiny jot,",
    "A birthmark I think where finger bone",
    "Joins palm, mark of the fish,",
    "Living thing in search of a watering",
    "Hole set in a walled garden,",
    "Or in a field with all the fences torn:",
    "Where I hear your father cry into the wind",
    "That beats against stones in a small town",
    "Where you were born; its cornfields",
    "Skyward pointing, never sown, never",
    "To be reaped, flagrant, immortal."
