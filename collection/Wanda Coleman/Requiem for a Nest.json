    "the winged thang built her dream palace",
    "amid the fine green eyes of a sheltering bough",
    "she did not know it was urban turf",
    "disguised as serenely delusionally rural",
    "nor did she know the neighborhood was rife",
    "with slant-mawed felines and those long-taloned",
    "swoopers of prey. she was ignorant of the acidity & oil",
    "that slowly polluted the earth, and was never",
    "to detect the serpent coiled one strong limb below",
    "following her nature she flitted and dove",
    "for whatever blades twigs and mud",
    "could be found under the humming blue",
    "and created a hatchery for her spawn",
    "not knowing all were doomed"
