    "I wore a garland of the briar that put me now in awe",
    "I wore a garland of the brain that was whole",
    "It commanded me, done babbling",
    "And I no more blabbed, spare no lie",
    "Tell womanhood she shake off pity",
    "Tell the man to give up tumult for the while",
    "To wonder at the sight of baby's beauty",
    "Ne let the monsters fray us with things that not be",
    "From a high tower poem issuing",
    "Everything run along in creation till I end the song",
    "Ne none fit for so wild beasts",
    "Ne none so joyous, ne none no give no lie",
    "Tell old woes to leave off here:",
    "I sing this into a scallop shell with face of a pearl",
    "& leave all sorrow bye & bye."
