    "Do I not play the delicate game of language?",
    "yes, & it is antecedent to the affairs of the world:",
    "The dish, the mop, the stove, the bed, the marriage",
    "& surges forth the world in which I love",
    "I and I and I and I and I and I, infinitely reversible",
    "Yet never secure in the long morning texture",
    "A poor existing woman-being, accept her broken heart",
    "& yet the earth is divinity, the sky is divinity",
    "The nomads walk & walk."
