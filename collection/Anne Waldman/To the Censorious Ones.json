    "I'm coming up out of the tomb, Men of War",
    "Just when you thought you had me down, in place, hidden",
    "I'm coming up now",
    "Can you feel the ground rumble under your feet?",
    "It's breaking apart, it's turning over, it's pushing up",
    "It's thrusting into your point of view, your private property",
    "O Men of War, Censorious Ones!",
    "I'm coming up now",
    "I'm coming up with all that was hidden",
    "Get ready, Big Boys, get ready",
    "I'm coming up with all you wanted buried,",
    "All the hermetic texts with stories in them of hot & dangerous women",
    "Women with lascivious tongues, sharp eyes & claws",
    "I've been working out, my muscles are strong",
    "I'm pushing up the earth with all you try to censor",
    "All the iconoclasm & bravado you scorn",
    "All the taunts against your banner & salute",
    "I'm coming up from Hell with all you ever suppressed",
    "All the dark fantasies, all the dregs are coming back",
    "I'm leading them back up now",
    "They're going to bark & scoff & rage & bite",
    "I'm opening the box",
    "!"
