    "Three sorts of serpents do resemble thee:",
    "That dangerous eye-killing cockatrice,",
    "The enchanting siren, which doth so entice,",
    "The weeping crocodile\u2014these vile pernicious three.",
    "The basilisk his nature takes from thee,",
    "Who for my life in secret wait dost lie,",
    "And to my heart sendst poison from thine eye:",
    "Thus do I feel the pain, the cause, yet cannot see.",
    "Fair-maid no more, but Mer-maid be thy name,",
    "Who with thy sweet alluring harmony",
    "Hast played the thief, and stolen my heart from me,",
    "And like a tyrant makst my grief thy game:",
    "Thou crocodile, who when thou hast me slain,",
    "Lamentst my death, with tears of thy disdain."
