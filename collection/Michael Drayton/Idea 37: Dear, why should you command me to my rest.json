    "Dear, why should you command me to my rest",
    "When now the night doth summon all to sleep?",
    "Methinks this time becometh lovers best;",
    "Night was ordain'd together friends to keep.",
    "How happy are all other living things",
    "Which, though the day disjoin by sev'ral flight,",
    "The quiet ev'ning yet together brings,",
    "And each returns unto his love at night!",
    "O thou that art so courteous else to all,",
    "Why should'st thou, Night, abuse me only thus,",
    "That ev'ry creature to his kind dost call,",
    "And yet 'tis thou dost only sever us?",
    "Well could I wish it would be ever day,",
    "If when night comes you bid me go away."
