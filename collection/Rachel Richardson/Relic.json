    "The first time I touched it,",
    "cloth fell under my fingers,",
    "the frail white folds",
    "softened, demure. No burn,",
    "no combustion at the touch of skin.",
    "It sat, silent, like any other contents",
    "of any other box: photographs",
    "of the dead, heirloom jewels.",
    "Exposed to thin windowlight it is",
    "exactly as in movies:",
    "a long gown, and where a chest",
    "must have breathed, a red cross",
    "crossed over. The crown, I know,",
    "waits underneath, the hood with eyes",
    "carefully stitched open, arch cap",
    "like a bishop\u2019s, surging to its point."
