    "When I was a young man, I loved to write poems",
    "And I called a spade a spade",
    "And the only only thing that made me sing",
    "Was to lift the masks at the masquerade.",
    "I took them off my own face,",
    "I took them off others too",
    "And the only only wrong in all my song",
    "Was the view that I knew what was true.",
    "Now I am older and tireder too",
    "And the tasks with the masks are quite trying.",
    "I\u2019d gladly gladly stop if I only only knew",
    "A better way to keep from lying,",
    "And not get nervous and blue",
    "When I said something quite untrue:",
    "I looked all around and all over",
    "To find something else to do:",
    "I tried to be less romantic",
    "I tried to be less starry-eyed too:",
    "But I only got mixed up and frantic",
    "Forgetting what was false and what was true.",
    "But tonight I am going to the masked ball,",
    "Because it has occurred to me",
    "That the masks are more true than the faces:",
    "\u2014Perhaps this too is poetry?",
    "I no longer yearn to be na\u00efve and stern",
    "And masked balls fascinate me:",
    "Now that I know that most falsehoods are true",
    "Perhaps I can join the charade?",
    "This is, at any rate, my new and true view:",
    "Let live and believe, I say.",
    "The only only thing is to believe in everything:",
    "It\u2019s more fun and safer that way!"
