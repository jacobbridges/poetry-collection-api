    "You and I inhabit thresholds, clinging to neither here nor there, and to",
    "and: this is a threshold of no relief, of interrogative light and obviated",
    "shadows, of questions flattened between clapboard slides,",
    "in laboratories of hanging frames\u2014in a potential frame,",
    "the next moment slumps beneath the shadow of the overhang.",
    "They call it earthquake weather, a day like this, of reflected light",
    "and leveling heat of no relief, of corners around which",
    "and angles of incidence jellied in consomm\u00e9,",
    "molded in amber lunches of tea and",
    "impossible: no incidents or tension, no reflection.",
    "No striations: rather, bangle, a broken shoelace",
    "and what are we going to do about that hair?",
    "We were in a boat. You were navigating and I was tending",
    "the lines, which flew from my hands, flapping like live wires",
    "on the wind. You watched the shadow of our sail on the water",
    "through the light reflected in your face, conducted a depth sounding:",
    "You went under, but not overboard, swam away to plot reliefs",
    "of ocean floors. It is far too shallow here to die."
