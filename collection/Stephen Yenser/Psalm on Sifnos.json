    "One does not want,",

    "Up by still waters",
    "Of words a cairn",
    "But hopes to attend",
    "A small covert",
    "Of tamarisk",
    "Whose leaves salty",
    "Yet feathery",
    "Will shed light over",
    "A thickened plot.",
    "One wants at last",
    "To cede the field",
    "To tamarisk",
    "And mastic tree,",
    "To olive and stone,",
    "Stones in the fruit,",
    "Seed in the stones."
