    "To the Metropolitan Police Force, London:",
    "the asylum gates are locked and chained, but undone",
    "by wandering thoughts and the close study of maps.",
    "So from San Francisco, patron city of tramps,",
    "I scribble this note, having overshot Gloucester",
    "by several million strides, having walked on water.",
    "City of sad foghorns and clapboard ziggurats,",
    "of snakes-and-ladders streets and cadged cigarettes,",
    "city of pelicans, fish bones and flaking paint,",
    "of underfoot cable-car wires strained to breaking point ...",
    "I eat little \u2014 a beard of grass, a pinch of oats \u2014",
    "let the salt-tide scour and purge me inside and out,",
    "but my mind still phosphoresces with lightning strikes",
    "and I straddle each earthquake, one foot either side",
    "of the fault line, rocking the world\u2019s seesaw.",
    "At dusk, the Golden Gate Bridge is heaven\u2019s seashore:",
    "I watch boats heading home with the day\u2019s catch",
    "or ferrying souls to glittering Alcatraz,",
    "or I face west and let the Pacific slip",
    "in bloodshot glory over the planet\u2019s lip,",
    "sense the waterfall at the end of the journey.",
    "I am, ever your countryman, Ivor Gurney."
