    "A huge purple door washed up in the bay overnight,",
    "its paintwork blistered and peeled from weeks at sea.",
    "The town storyteller wasted no time in getting to work:",
    "the beguiling, eldest girl of a proud, bankrupt farmer",
    "had slammed that door in the face of a Freemason\u2019s son,",
    "who in turn had bulldozed both farm and family",
    "over the cliff, except for the girl, who lived now",
    "by the light and heat of a driftwood fire on a beach.",
    "There was some plan to use the door as a jetty",
    "or landing-stage, but it was all bullshit, the usual idle talk.",
    "That\u2019s when he left and never returned. Him I won\u2019t name \u2014",
    "not known for his big ideas or carpentry skills,",
    "a famous non-swimmer, but last seen sailing out,",
    "riding the current and rounding the point in a small boat",
    "with tell-tale flashes of almost certainly purple paint."
