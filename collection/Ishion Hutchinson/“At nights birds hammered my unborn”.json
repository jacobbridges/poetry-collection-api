    "At nights birds hammered my unborn",
    "child\u2019s heart to strength, each strike bringing",
    "bones and spine to glow, her lungs pestled",
    "loud as the sea I was raised a sea anemone",
    "among women who cursed their hearts",
    "out, soured themselves, never-brides,",
    "into veranda shades, talcum and tea moistened",
    "their quivering jaws, prophetic without prophecy.",
    "Anvil-black, gleaming garlic nubs, the pageant arrived with sails unfurled",
    "from Colchis and I rejoiced like a broken",
    "asylum to see burning sand grains, skittering ice;",
    "shekels clapped in my chest, I smashed my head against a lightbulb",
    "and light sprinkled my hair; I rejoiced, a poui",
    "tree hit by the sun in the room, a man, a man."
