    "With her one horrid eye persistently unfastened, a vigilant bird",
    "watched my grandfather during the Great Depression",
    "use each evening of one whole year to wander his corn fields",
    "knowing this world is just one pig after another",
    "in one pen after another. Therefore, the bird heard him suppose,",
    "shouldn\u2019t he with his best gun, machete, Buick, or rope",
    "terminate his acquaintance with the tiresome setup",
    "of breakfast-lunch-dinner-dawn-dusk-fall-winter-spring-summer-",
    "blah-blah-blah? But his girls were good-looking",
    "and made such fine pies, so the bird watched him live wretchedly",
    "until he died more naturally of cancer",
    "too soon to see his people become the dopefiends, doctor-haters,",
    "masturbators, insomniacs, sleep fanatics, shut-ins, and teetotalers",
    "the bird knew they would become, for the purpose of girls",
    "is to just ruin everything with wanton reproduction",
    "so that now now now it\u2019s really relentless\u2014how heavy",
    "his people got in their limbs and how torrential, thus,",
    "the frenzied wind, though beyond the eye of the bird",
    "is the small, ashen brain of the bird, and below that, a heart,",
    "I swear, through which come the iffy notes of this cruel song."
