    "... Fontainebleau, Mattapoisett, Puget Sound....",
    "Nowhere was anywhere after a summer",
    "at my Grandfather\u2019s farm.",
    "Diamond-pointed, athirst and Norman,",
    "its alley of poplars",
    "paraded from Grandmother\u2019s rose garden",
    "to a scary stand of virgin pine,",
    "scrub, and paths forever pioneering.",
    "One afternoon in 1922,",
    "I sat on the stone porch, looking through",
    "screens as black-grained as drifting coal.",
    "clumped our Alpine, Edwardian cuckoo clock,",
    "slung with strangled, wooden game.",
    "Our farmer was cementing a root-house under the hill.",
    "One of my hands was cool on a pile",
    "of black earth, the other warm",
    "on a pile of lime. All about me",
    "were the works of my Grandfather\u2019s hands:",
    "snapshots of his",
    "silver mine;",
    "his high school at",
    "stogie-brown beams; fools\u2019-gold nuggets;",
    "octagonal red tiles,",
    "sweaty with a secret dank, crummy with ant-stale;",
    "a Rocky Mountain chaise longue,",
    "its legs, shellacked saplings.",
    "A pastel-pale Huckleberry Finn",
    "fished with a broom straw in a basin",
    "hollowed out of a millstone.",
    "Like my Grandfather, the d",

    "was manly, comfortable,",
    "overbearing, disproportioned.",
    "What were those sunflowers? Pumpkins floating shoulder-high?",
    "It was sunset, Sadie and Nellie",
    "bearing pitchers of ice-tea,",
    "oranges, lemons, mint, and peppermints,",
    "and the jug of shandygaff,",
    "which Grandpa made by blending half and half",
    "yeasty, wheezing homemade sarsaparilla with beer.",
    "The farm, entitled",
    "in the Social Register,",

    "I was a stuffed toucan",
    "with a bibulous, multicolored beak.",
    "Up in the air",
    "by the lakeview window in the billiards-room,",
    "lurid in the doldrums of the sunset hour,",
    "my Great Aunt Sarah",
    "was learning",
    "and",
    "She thundered on the keyboard of her dummy piano,",
    "with gauze curtains like a boudoir table,",
    "accordionlike yet soundless.",
    "It had been bought to spare the nerves",
    "of my Grandmother,",
    "tone-deaf, quick as a cricket,",
    "now needing a fourth for \u201cAuction,\u201d",
    "and casting a thirsty eye",

    "from her bed of troublesome snacks and Tauchnitz classics.",
    "Forty years earlier,",
    "twenty, auburn headed,",
    "grasshopper notes of genius!",
    "Family gossip says Aunt Sarah",
    "tilted her archaic Athenian nose",
    "and jilted an Astor.",
    "Each morning she practiced",
    "on the grand piano at Symphony Hall,",

    "... A sail-colored horse browsing in the bullrushes ...",
    "A fluff of the west wind puffing",
    "my blouse, kiting me over our seven chimneys,",
    "troubling the waters....",
    "As small as sapphires were the ponds:",
    "and",
    "halved by \u201cthe Island,\u201d",
    "where my Uncle\u2019s duck blind",
    "floated in a barrage of smoke-clouds.",
    "Double-barreled shotguns",
    "stuck out like bundles of baby crow-bars.",
    "A single sculler in a camouflaged kayak",
    "was quacking to the decoys....",
    "At the cabin between the waters,",
    "the nearest windows were already boarded.",
    "Uncle Devereux was closing camp for the winter.",
    "As if posed for \u201cthe engagement photograph,\u201d",

    "war-uniform of a volunteer Canadian officer.",
    "Daylight from the doorway riddled his student posters,",
    "tacked helter-skelter on walls as raw as a boardwalk.",
    "Mr. Punch, a water melon in hockey tights,",
    "was tossing off a decanter of Scotch.",
    "in a red, white and blue toga",
    "was accepting the arm of her \u201cprotector,\u201d",
    "the ingenu and porcine Edward VII.",
    "The pre-war music hall belles",
    "had goose necks, glorious signatures, beauty-moles,",
    "and coils of hair like rooster tails.",
    "The finest poster was two or three young men in khaki kilts",
    "being bushwhacked on the veldt\u2014",
    "They were almost life-size....",
    "My Uncle was dying at twenty-nine.",
    "\u201cYou are behaving like children,\u201d",
    "said my Grandfather,",
    "when my Uncle and Aunt left their three baby daughters,",
    "and sailed for Europe on a last honeymoon ...",
    "I cowered in terror.",
    "I wasn\u2019t a child at all\u2014",
    "unseen and all-seeing, I was Agrippina",
    "in the Golden House of Nero....",
    "Near me was the white measuring-door",
    "my Grandfather had penciled with my Uncle\u2019s heights.",
    "In 1911, he had stopped growing at just six feet.",
    "While I sat on the tiles,",
    "and dug at the anchor on my sailor blouse,",
    "Uncle Devereux stood behind me.",
    "He was as brushed as Bayard, our riding horse.",
    "His face was putty.",
    "His blue coat and white trousers",
    "grew sharper and straighter.",
    "His coat was a blue jay\u2019s tail,",
    "his trousers were solid cream from the top of the bottle.",
    "He was animated, hierarchical,",
    "like a ginger snap man in a clothes-press.",
    "He was dying of the incurable Hodgkin\u2019s disease....",
    "My hands were warm, then cool, on the piles",
    "of earth and lime,",
    "a black pile and a white pile....",
    "Come winter,",
    "Uncle Devereux would blend to the one color."
