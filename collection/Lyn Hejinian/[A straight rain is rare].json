    "A straight rain is rare and doors have suspicions",
    "and I hold that names begin histories",
    "and that the last century was a cruel one. I am pretending",
    "to be a truck in Mexico. I am a woman with a long neck and a good burden",
    "and I waddle efficiently. Activity never sleeps and no tale of crumbling cliffs",
    "can be a short one. I have to shift weight favorably. Happiness",
    "can\u2019t be settled. I brush my left knee twice, my right once,",
    "my left twice again and in that way advance. The alphabet",
    "and the cello can represent horses but I can only pretend",
    "to be a dog slurping pudding. After the 55 minutes it takes to finish",
    "my legs tremble. All is forgiven. Yesterday is going the way of tomorrow",
    "indirectly and the heat of the sun is inadequate at this depth. I see",
    "the moon. The verbs ought and can lack infinity and somewhere",
    "between 1957 when the heat of the dry sun naughtily struck me",
    "and now when my secrets combine in the new order of cold rains",
    "and night winds a lot has happened. Long phrases",
    "are made up of short phrases that bear everything \u201cin vain\u201d or \u201call",
    "in fun\u201d \u201cfor your sake\u201d and \u201cstep by step\u201d precisely. I too can spring."
