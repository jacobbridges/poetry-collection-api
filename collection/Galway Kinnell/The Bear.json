    "1",
    "In late winter",
    "I sometimes glimpse bits of steam",
    "coming up from",
    "some fault in the old snow",
    "and bend close and see it is lung-colored",
    "and put down my nose",
    "and know",
    "the chilly, enduring odor of bear.",
    "2",
    "I take a wolf\u2019s rib and whittle",
    "it sharp at both ends",
    "and coil it up",
    "and freeze it in blubber and place it out",
    "on the fairway of the bears.",
    "And when it has vanished",
    "I move out on the bear tracks,",
    "roaming in circles",
    "until I come to the first, tentative, dark",
    "splash on the earth.",
    "And I set out",
    "running, following the splashes",
    "of blood wandering over the world.",
    "At the cut, gashed resting places",
    "I stop and rest,",
    "at the crawl-marks",
    "where he lay out on his belly",
    "to overpass some stretch of bauchy ice",
    "I lie out",
    "dragging myself forward with bear-knives in my fists.",
    "3",
    "On the third day I begin to starve,",
    "at nightfall I bend down as I knew I would",
    "at a turd sopped in blood,",
    "and hesitate, and pick it up,",
    "and thrust it in my mouth, and gnash it down,",
    "and rise",
    "and go on running.",
    "4",
    "On the seventh day,",
    "living by now on bear blood alone,",
    "I can see his upturned carcass far out ahead, a scraggled,",
    "steamy hulk,",
    "the heavy fur riffling in the wind.",
    "I come up to him",
    "and stare at the narrow-spaced, petty eyes,",
    "the dismayed",
    "face laid back on the shoulder, the nostrils",
    "flared, catching",
    "perhaps the first taint of me as he",
    "died.",
    "I hack",
    "a ravine in his thigh, and eat and drink,",
    "and tear him down his whole length",
    "and open him and climb in",
    "and close him up after me, against the wind,",
    "and sleep.",
    "5",
    "And dream",
    "of lumbering flatfooted",
    "over the tundra,",
    "stabbed twice from within,",
    "splattering a trail behind me,",
    "splattering it out no matter which way I lurch,",
    "no matter which parabola of bear-transcendence,",
    "which dance of solitude I attempt,",
    "which gravity-clutched leap,",
    "which trudge, which groan.",
    "6",
    "Until one day I totter and fall\u2014",
    "fall on this",
    "stomach that has tried so hard to keep up,",
    "to digest the blood as it leaked in,",
    "to break up",
    "and digest the bone itself: and now the breeze",
    "blows over me, blows off",
    "the hideous belches of ill-digested bear blood",
    "and rotted stomach",
    "and the ordinary, wretched odor of bear,",
    "blows across",
    "my sore, lolled tongue a song",
    "or screech, until I think I must rise up",
    "and dance. And I lie still.",
    "7",
    "I awaken I think. Marshlights",
    "reappear, geese",
    "come trailing again up the flyway.",
    "In her ravine under old snow the dam-bear",
    "lies, licking",
    "lumps of smeared fur",
    "and drizzly eyes into shapes",
    "with her tongue. And one",
    "hairy-soled trudge stuck out before me,",
    "the next groaned out,",
    "the next,",
    "the next,",
    "the rest of my days I spend",
    "wandering: wondering",
    "what, anyway,",
    "was that sticky infusion, that rank flavor of blood, that poetry, by which I lived?"
