    "A black bear sits alone",
    "in the twilight, nodding from side",
    "to side, turning slowly around and around",
    "on himself, scuffing the four-footed",
    "circle into the earth. He sniffs the sweat",
    "in the breeze, he understands",
    "a creature, a death-creature,",
    "watches from the fringe of the trees,",
    "finally he understands",
    "I am no longer here, he himself",
    "from the fringe of the trees watches",
    "a black bear",
    "get up, eat a few flowers, trudge away,",
    "all his fur glistening",
    "in the rain.",
    "And what glistening! Sancho Fergus,",
    "my boychild, had such great shoulders,",
    "when he was born his head",
    "came out, the rest of him stuck. And he opened",
    "his eyes: his head out there all alone",
    "in the room, he squinted with pained,",
    "barely unglued eyes at the ninth-month\u2019s",
    "blood splashing beneath him",
    "on the floor. And almost",
    "smiled, I thought, almost forgave it all in advance.",
    "When he came wholly forth",
    "I took him up in my hands and bent",
    "over and smelled",
    "the black, glistening fur",
    "of his head, as empty space",
    "must have bent",
    "over the newborn planet",
    "and smelled the grasslands and the ferns.",
