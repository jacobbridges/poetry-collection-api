    "He lives, who last night flopped from a log",
    "Into the creek, and all night by an ankle",
    "Lay pinned to the flood, dead as a nail",
    "But for the skin of the teeth of his dog.",
    "I brought him boiled eggs and broth.",
    "He coughed and waved his spoon",
    "And sat up saying he would dine alone,",
    "Being fatigue itself after that bath.",
    "I sat without in the sun with the dog.",
    "Wearing a stocking on the ailing foot,",
    "In monster crutches, he hobbled out,",
    "And addressed the dog in bitter rage.",
    "He told the yellow hound, his rescuer,",
    "Its heart was bad, and it ought",
    "Not wander by the creek at night;",
    "If all his dogs got drowned he would be poor.",
    "He stroked its head and disappeared in the shed",
    "And came out with a stone mallet in his hands",
    "And lifted that rocky weight of many pounds",
    "And let it lapse on top of the dog's head.",
    "I carted off the carcass, dug it deep.",
    "Then he came too with what a thing to lug,",
    "Or pour on a dog\u2019s grave, his thundermug,",
    "And poured it out and went indoors to sleep.",
    "I saw him sleepless in the pane of glass",
    "Looking wild-eyed at sunset, then the glare",
    "Blinded the glass\u2014only a red square",
    "Burning a house burning in the wilderness."
