    "thick eyes",
    "puff and foreclose by the moon. The young, heads",
    "trailed by the beginnings of necks,",
    "shiver,",
    "in the guarantee they shall be bodies.",

    "I hear its drone, drifting, high up",
    "in immaculate ozone.",

    "And I hear,",
    "coming over the hills, America singing,",
    "her varied carols I hear:",
    "crack of deputies' rifles practicing their aim on stray dogs at night,",
    "sput of cattleprod,",
    "TV going on about the smells of the human body,",
    "curses of the soldier as he poisons, burns, grinds, and stabs",
    "the rice of the world,",
    "with open mouth, crying strong, hysterical curses.",

    "bloodsuckers on their heel, knowing",
    "flesh thrown down in the sunshine",
    "dogs shall eat",
    "and flesh flung into the air",
    "shall be seized by birds,",
    "shoulder blades smooth, unmarked by old feather-holes,",
    "hands rivered",
    "by blue, erratic wanderings of the blood,",
    "eyes crinkled shut at almost seeing",
    "the drifting sun that gives us our lives."
