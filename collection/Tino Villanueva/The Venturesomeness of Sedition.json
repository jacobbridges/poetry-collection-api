    "The unrestricted sun",
    "had split the day in two,",
    "and now we went",
    "on the edge of the afternoon",
    "like a tableau of bent figures",
    "made of faded blue duck.",
    "We went like a wandering",
    "and stinking, sweating brotherhood,",
    "pull by pull between",
    "the leafy cotton plants,",
    "with the pathetic appearance of arriving",
    "at the end of the furrow.",
    "But we always arrived",
    "in a rush to get there,",
    "and the sole logic was",
    "we had to move over",
    "to the next furrow,",
    "and no one could stop",
    "the counterflow down it.",
    "And I, the dusty kid",
    "left behind in the middle of the field,",
    "held prisoner in my own slow shadow,",
    "was right",
    "in not giving in to the absurd pace",
    "of tradition.",
    "So my days burned up",
    "in that captive state",
    "of childhood.",
    "Then, yes,",
    "it was then the venturesomeness",
    "of sedition overtook me.",
    "Saturdays,",
    "after noon,",
    "the body finally lying down",
    "in the waves of the aluminum bathtub.",
    "And in the liberating rite of the water,",
    "I could shed",
    "the grime and contemplate",
    "the muddy waters of time.",
    "So it was,",
    "with the ablution of the weekly bath,",
    "I exiled myself each time",
    "from what I was."
