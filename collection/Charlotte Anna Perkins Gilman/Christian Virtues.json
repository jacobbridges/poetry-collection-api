    "Oh, dear!",
    "The Christian virtues will disappear!",
    "Nowhere on land or sea",
    "Will be room for charity!",
    "Nowhere, in field or city,",
    "A person to help or pity!",
    "Better for them, no doubt,",
    "Not to need helping out",
    "Of their old miry ditch.",
    "But, alas for us, the rich!",
    "For we shall lose, you see,",
    "Our boasted charity!\u2014",
    "Lose all the pride and joy",
    "Of giving the poor employ,",
    "And money, and food, and love",
    "(And making stock thereof!).",
    "Our Christian virtues are gone,",
    "With nothing to practise on!",
    "It don\u2019t hurt them a bit,",
    "For they can\u2019t practise it;",
    "But it\u2019s our great joy and pride\u2014",
    "What virtue have we beside?",
    "We believe, as sure as we live,",
    "That it is more blessed to give",
    "Than to want, and waste, and grieve,",
    "And occasionally receive!",
    "And here are the people pressing",
    "To rob us of our pet blessing!",
    "No chance to endow or bedizen",
    "A hospital, school or prison,",
    "And leave our own proud name",
    "To Gratitude and Fame!",
    "No chance to do one good deed,",
    "To give what we do not need,",
    "To leave what we cannot use",
    "To those whom we deign to choose!",
    "When none want broken meat,",
    "How shall our cake be sweet?",
    "When none want flannels and coals,",
    "How shall we save our souls?",
    "Oh, dear! Oh, dear!",
    "The Christian virtues will disappear!",
    "The poor have their virtues rude,\u2014",
    "Meekness and gratitude,",
    "Endurance, and respect",
    "For us, the world\u2019s elect;",
    "Economy, self-denial,",
    "Patience in every trial,",
    "Self-sacrifice, self-restraint,\u2014",

    "Virtues enough to bear",
    "All this life\u2019s sorrow and care!",
    "Virtues by which to rise",
    "To a front seat in the skies!",
    "How can they turn from this",
    "To common earthly bliss,\u2014",
    "Mere clothes, and food, and drink,",
    "And leisure to read and think,",
    "And art, and beauty, and ease,\u2014",
    "There is no crown for these!",
    "True, if their gratitude",
    "Were not for fire and food,",
    "They might still learn to bless",
    "The Lord for their happiness!",
    "And, instead of respect for wealth,",
    "Might learn from beauty, and health,",
    "And freedom in power and pelf,",
    "Each man to respect himself!",
    "And, instead of scraping and saving,",
    "Might learn from using and having",
    "That man\u2019s life should be spent",
    "In a grand development!",
    "But this is petty and small;",
    "These are not virtues at all;",
    "They do not look as they should;",
    "They don\u2019t do",
    "any good!",
    "Oh, dear! Oh, dear! Oh, dear!",
    "The Christian virtues will disappear!"
