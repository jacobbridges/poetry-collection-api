    "The American public is patient,",

    "The American public will stand as much",
    "As any public I know.",
    "We submit to be killed by our railroads,",
    "We submit to be fooled by our press,",
    "We can stand as much government scandal",
    "As any folks going, I guess,",
    "We can bear bad air in the subway,",
    "We can bear quick death in the street,",
    "But we are a little particular",
    "About the things we eat.",
    "It is not so much that it kills us --",
    "We are used to being killed;",

    "But we grudge the horrid doubt.",
    "Is it ham or trichinosis?",
    "Can a label command belief?",
    "Is it pork we have purchased, or poison?",
    "Is it tuberculosis or beef?",
    "There is really a choice of diseases,",
    "To any one, little or big;",
    "And no man really pleases",
    "To die of a long dead pig.",
    "We take our risks as we\u2019re able,",
    "On elevator and train,",
    "But to sit in peace at the table",
    "And to be seized with sudden pain",
    "When we are at home and happy --",
    "Is really against the grain.",
    "And besides admitting the poison,",
    "Admitting we all must die,",
    "Accepting the second-hand sickness",
    "From a cholera-smitten stye;",
    "Patiently bearing the murder,",
