    "Someone must have seen an old dog",
    "dragging its broken body through",
    "the wet grass;",
    "someone should have known it was lost,",
    "drinking from the old well, then lifting",
    "its head to the wind off the bottoms,",
    "and someone might have wanted that dog",
    "trailing its legs along the ground",
    "like vines sliding up the creek",
    "searching for sun;",
    "but they were not there when the dog",
    "wandered through Turley\u2019s Woods looking",
    "for food and stopped beneath the thorn trees",
    "and wrapped its tail around its nose",
    "until it was covered by falling leaves",
    "that piled up and up",
    "until there was no lost dog at all",
    "to hear the distant voice calling",
    "through the timber,",
    "only a tired heart breathing slower,",
    "and breath, soft as mist, above the leaves."
