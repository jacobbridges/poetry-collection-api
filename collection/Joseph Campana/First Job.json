    "All evening I hunted",
    "the bird that wanted",
    "a cage of glass,",
    "here where cemetery",
    "slides into creek, fronting",
    "what was once the largest",
    "indoor leather mill in the world.",
    "There the skins gathered",
    "for cleansing, coloring,",
    "scraping, shipping off.",
    "It closed three years after",
    "a lone sparrow set up camp",
    "behind the only desk",
    "in the only full-serve",
    "service station left in town",
    "where, from four to seven",
    "nightly one summer,",
    "I blackened the pages",
    "of books with my thumbs.",
    "Whatever it sought there\u2014",
    "thumping its frightened body",
    "against glass, into cabinets",
    "or out to the bays",
    "scrubbed raw with gasoline",
    "where the broken waited",
    "to be raised up, hosed off,",
    "fastened together in hope",
    "of coughing to life again\u2014",
    "whatever it sought was not a dollar",
    "slipped through a window cracked",
    "because patronage was right",
    "for the aging ladies of August to provide",
    "from Chryslers cool in the sun.",
    "There was nothing to be found",
    "in books or boxes of parts.",
    "And the tools hanging from pegs",
    "were as useless as my hands,",
    "which could not patch together",
    "those straggling conveyances",
    "any more than I could",
    "with a tattered broom",
    "batter the bird to freedom",
    "as I swung at fluttering terror",
    "as I sought with useless devices",
    "some fortune reposed",
    "in corners of grease and dust."
