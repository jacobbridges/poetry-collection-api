    "You could drive blind",
    "for those two seconds",
    "and they would be forever.",
    "I think that as a diesel truck",
    "passes us eight miles east of Mission.",
    "Churning through the storm, heedless",
    "of the hill sliding away.",
    "There isn\u2019t much use to curse but I do.",
    "Words fly away, tumbling invisibly",
    "toward the unseen point where",
    "the prairie and sky meet.",
    "The road is like that in those seconds,",
    "nothing but the blind white side",
    "of creation.",
    "You\u2019re there somewhere,",
    "a tiny struggling cell.",
    "You just might be significant",
    "but you might not be anything.",
    "Forever is a space of split time",
    "from which to recover after the mass passes.",
    "My curse flies out there somewhere,",
    "and then I send my prayer into the wake",
    "of the diesel truck headed for Sioux Falls",
    "one hundred and eighty miles through the storm."
