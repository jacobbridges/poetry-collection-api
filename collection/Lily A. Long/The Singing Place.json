    "Cold may lie the day,",
    "And bare of grace;",
    "At night I slip away",
    "To the Singing Place.",
    "A border of mist and doubt",
    "Before the gate,",
    "And the Dancing Stars grow still",
    "As hushed I wait.",
    "Then faint and far away",
    "I catch the beat",
    "In broken rhythm and rhyme",
    "Of joyous feet,\u2014",
    "Lifting waves of sound",
    "That will rise and swell",
    "(If the prying eyes of thought",
    "Break not the spell),",
    "Rise and swell and retreat",
    "And fall and flee,",
    "As over the edge of sleep",
    "They beckon me.",
    "And I wait as the seaweed waits",
    "For the lifting tide;",
    "To ask would be to awake,\u2014",
    "To be denied.",
    "I cloud my eyes in the mist",
    "That veils the hem,\u2014",
    "And then with a rush I am past,-\u2014",
    "I am Theirs, and of Them!",
    "And the pulsing chant swells up",
    "To touch the sky,",
    "And the song is joy, is life,",
    "And the song am I!",
    "The thunderous music peals",
    "Around, o'erhead-",
    "The dead would awake to hear",
    "If there were dead;",
    "But the life of the throbbing Sun",
    "Is in the song,",
    "And we weave the world anew,",
    "And the Singing Throng",
    "Fill every corner of space\u2014-",
    "Over the edge of sleep",
    "I bring but a trace",
    "Of the chants that pulse and sweep",
    "In the Singing Place."
