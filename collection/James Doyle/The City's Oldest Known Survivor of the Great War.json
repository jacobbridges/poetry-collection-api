    "marches in uniform down the traffic stripe",
    "at the center of the street, counts time",
    "to the unseen web that has rearranged",
    "the air around him, his left hand",
    "stiff as a leather strap along his side,",
    "the other saluting right through the decades",
    "as if they weren't there, as if everyone under ninety",
    "were pervasive fog the morning would dispel",
    "in its own good time, as if the high school band",
    "all flapping thighs and cuffs behind him",
    "were as ghostly as the tumbleweed on every road",
    "dead-ended in the present, all the ancient infantry",
    "shoulder right, through a skein of bone, presenting arms",
    "across the drift, nothing but empty graves now",
    "to round off another century,",
    "the sweet honey of the old cadence, the streets",
    "going by at attention, the banners glistening with dew,",
    "the wives and children blowing kisses."
