    "In your arms was still delight,",
    "Quiet as a street at night;",
    "And thoughts of you, I do remember,",
    "Were green leaves in a darkened chamber,",
    "Were dark clouds in a moonless sky.",
    "Love, in you, went passing by,",
    "Penetrative, remote, and rare,",
    "Like a bird in the wide air,",
    "And, as the bird, it left no trace",
    "In the heaven of your face.",
    "In your stupidity I found",
    "The sweet hush after a sweet sound.",
    "All about you was the light",
    "That dims the greying end of night;",
    "Desire was the unrisen sun,",
    "Joy the day not yet begun,",
    "With tree whispering to tree,",
    "Without wind, quietly.",
    "Wisdom slept within your hair,",
    "And Long-Suffering was there,",
    "And, in the flowing of your dress,",
    "Undiscerning Tenderness.",
    "And when you thought, it seemed to me,",
    "Infinitely, and like a sea,",
    "About the slight world you had known",
    "Your vast unsconsciousness was thrown . . .",
    "O haven without wave or tide!",
    "Silence, in which all songs have died!",
    "Holy book, where hearts are still!",
    "And home at length under the hill!",
    "O mother quiet, breasts of peace,",
    "Where love itself would faint and cease!",
    "O infinite deep I never knew,",
    "I would come back, come back to you,",
    "Find you, as a pool unstirred,",
    "Kneel down by you, and never a word,",
    "Lay my head, and nothing said,",
    "In your hands, ungarlanded;",
    "And a long watch you would keep;",
    "And I should sleep, and I should sleep!"
