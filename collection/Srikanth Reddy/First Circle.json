    "It\u2019s dark in here, the dark inside of a man",
    "in the dark. It\u2019s not night. One hears crows",
    "overhead, dawn fowl caws, the shod soles again",
    "treading their sunlit plots above. One grows",
    "dotish-fond of such things. Long live the things,",
    "their ways, their roots pushed goatish & gray",
    "through the skull, in this earth that gaily spins",
    "though one has crossed its smutted green threshold",
    "to reign in a crate. We have done no wrong,",
    "my friends, & yet we find ourselves soiled,",
    "sold, carbonized teeth in a moss-riven jaw.",
    "Once I sat on a stool as my grandmother told",
    "me of heaven. She cleaned fish for our living. I saw",
    "how her rusty black knife unseamed the sunset",
    "in each belly\u2014coral, ochre, carmine, raw,",
    "lice-infested sunsets in a pail. So many nights.",
    "Night in the kitchen shack, night at the crumbling edge",
    "of our milk-pond province, a blade, lone cricket",
    "raving in the lawn."
