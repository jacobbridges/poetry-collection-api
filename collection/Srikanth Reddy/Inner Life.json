    "The bear stopped dancing & unscrewed his head.",
    "He held it upside-down in the dusk. She reached",
    "into her pouch for a copper piece, but instead",
    "pulled out the silvery piece she\u2019d been saving",
    "for some special occasion. A limited issue,",
    "stamped on one side with a profile of the prince;",
    "on the other side a water wheel did not spin.",
    "It glowed in her hand. Her hand grew heavy with it,",
    "& the salts, & the bittersome oils of her hand.",
    "Was this the occasion? The others were there",
    "with their fists in their pouches & the weary bear",
    "held out his head as if it were an offering",
    "or an object lesson. It was neither. It was ripped,",
    "with russet handfuls of animals\u2019 hair pasted on",
    "& a secret eye slit recessed in its open maw.",
    "The wild old man in the bear suit parted his lips",
    "& out came a snatch of extinct birdsong.",
    "The musicians clapped. He\u2019d learned it as a boy",
    "growing up in the mist-proud interior",
    "where he would call & call until the violet males",
    "in a frenzy swooped into his breathtaking nets."
