    "The ward beds float like ghost ships",
    "in the darkness, the nightlight",
    "above my bed I pretend is a lighthouse",
    "with a little man inside who wears",
    "a sailor cap and tells good old stories",
    "of the sea. The little man is me.",
    "Perhaps I have a dog called Old Salt",
    "who laps my hand and runs endlessly",
    "down the circular stairs.",
    "Perhaps he bites like sin.",
    "I dream of ships smashing the reefs,",
    "their bottoms gutting out,",
    "the crews\u2019 disembodied voices screaming",
    "Help us help us help somebody please",
    "and there is no one there at all",
    "not even me. I wake up nervous,",
    "Old Salt gnawing my flesh. I wake up nervous,",
    "canvas bedstraps cutting my groin.",
    "The night nurse, making the rounds,",
    "says I bellow in sleep like a foghorn.",
    "*",
    "Nothing moves at night",
    "except small animals",
    "kept caged downstairs",
    "for experiments, going",
    "bullshit, and the Creole",
    "janitor\u2019s broom whisking",
    "closer by inches.",
    "In the ward, we all",
    "have room for errors and elbows",
    "to flail at excitement.",
    "We\u2019re right above the morgue;",
    "the iceboxes make our floor",
    "cold. The animals seem to know",
    "when someone, bored with holding",
    "on, gives out: they beat",
    "their heads and teeth",
    "against the chicken wire",
    "doors, scream and claw",
    "The janitor also knows.",
    "He props his heavy broom",
    "against his belt, makes",
    "a sign over himself",
    "learned from a Cajun,",
    "leaves us shaking",
    "in our bedstraps",
    "to drag the still",
    "warm and nervous body",
    "down from Isolation.",
    "*",
    "I have a garden in my brain",
    "shaped like a maze",
    "I lose myself",

    "a bush. One is crisp",
    "and cuts; one pinches. I\u2019d like to push",
    "them each somewhere.",
