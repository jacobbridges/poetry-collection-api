    "On the day a fourteen-year-old disappeared in Ojai, California,",
    "having left a Christmas Eve slumber party barefoot",
    "to \u201cgo with a guy\u201d in a green truck,",
    "and all Christmas Day volunteers searched for her body within a fifteen-mile radius,",
    "and her father and grandfather searched",
    "and spoke to reporters because TV coverage",
    "might help them find her if she were still alive,",
    "and her mother stayed home with the telephone,",
    "not appearing in public, and I could imagine",
    "this family deciding together this division of labor",
    "and what little else they could do to",
    "and the kitchen they sat in, the tones they spoke in,",
    "who cried and who didn\u2019t, and how they comforted one another",
    "with words of hope and strokings of backs and necks,",
    "but I couldn\u2019t imagine their fear that their daughter",
    "had been murdered in the woods, raped no doubt,",
    "tied up, chopped up, God knows what else,",
    "or them picturing her terror as it was happening to her",
    "or their own terror of her absence ever after,",
    "cut off from them before she had a chance to grow through adolescence,",
    "her room ever the same with its stupid posters of rock stars",
    "until they can bear to take them down",
    "because they can\u2019t bear to leave them up anymore\u2014",
    "on this day, which happened to be Christmas,",
    "at the kind of holiday gathering with a whole turkey and spiral-cut ham",
    "and beautiful dishes our hosts spent their money and time making",
    "to cheer their friends and enjoy the pleasure of giving,",
    "in a living room sparkling with scented candles and bunting",
    "and a ten-foot tree adorned with antique ornaments,",
    "the girl\u2019s disappearance kept surfacing in conversations across the room",
    "while I was being cornered by a man who said his wife was leaving him",
    "after twenty-one years of marriage, then recited his resum\u00e9",
    "as if this couldn\u2019t happen to someone with his business acumen;",
    "and it did again after I excused myself to refill my punch glass",
    "when someone at the punch bowl said what she had heard about it from someone else",
    "who had played tennis that morning with the girl\u2019s mother\u2019s doubles partner,",
    "while I filled a punch glass for somebody\u2019s dad",
    "brought along so he wouldn\u2019t be alone on Christmas,",
    "a man in his eighties with a face like a raven\u2019s,",
    "his body stooped, ravaged by age and diseases,",
    "who told me he was amazed to still be alive himself",
    "after a year in which he had lost both",
    "wife and son,",
    "then, to my amazement, began telling me how important",
    "he is in his business world",
    "just like the man I had just gotten away from,",
    "that he\u2019s still a player in international steel",
    "involved in top-drawer projects for the navy,",
    "and I was selfish enough to be selfless enough",
    "to draw him out a little, and the younger man, too",
    "(who appeared at my elbow again and started talking again),",
    "but not selfless enough to feel what they each were going through",
    "because my own fear and hunger",
    "cloud how I imagine everyone,",
    "including the bereaved family of the missing girl,",
    "and the girl herself, and certainly her murderer,",
    "although I know what it is to hate yourself completely",
    "and believe all human community is lies and bullshit",
    "and what happens to other people doesn\u2019t matter."
