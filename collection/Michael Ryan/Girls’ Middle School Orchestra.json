    "They\u2019re all dressed up in carmine",
    "floor-length velvet gowns, their upswirled hair",
    "festooned with matching ribbons:",
    "their fresh hopes and our fond hopes for them",
    "infuse this sort-of-music as if happiness could actually be",
    "each-plays-her-part-and-all-will-take-care-of-itself.",
    "Their hearts unscarred under quartz lights",
    "beam through the darkness in which we sit",
    "to show us why we endured at home",
    "the squeaking and squawking and botched notes",
    "that now in concert are almost beautiful,",
    "almost rendering this heartrending music",
    "composed for an archduke who loved it so much",
    "he spent his fortune for the musicians",
    "who could bring it brilliantly to life."
