    "As if sliding down the green, scuffed face",
    "of the wave, a seaplane falls",
    "and turns together, keeping the waters of",
    "the ear flat: a dead calm. But when the window\u2019s",
    "frowning strip of shoreline,",
    "the battalions of tropical-drinks umbrellas",
    "guarding the sandcastles and saltboxes",
    "of the rich,",
    "when these flip upside down, and the pale",
    "clouded sky floats below the ocean,",
    "then we jolt awake\u2014",
    "But this is not her dream, not water or land.",
    "The ropes of blood coil through her neck,",
    "they twist as it twists,",
    "as the head looks for parents and young men,",
    "for nurses, strangers, year upon year attending",
    "until the pulpy blood",
    "knots up at last, and the warrens of",
    "the brain dry and crackle, a town of names",
    "she saunters one long night:",
    "streets without signs lead to a girlhood park,",
    "to songs under stars, and lipstick,",
    "old houses forever",
    "unbuilding themselves\u2014but within the blue",
    "jungle scaffolding, a gallery of faces",
    "stares back at her,",
    "portraits she can\u2019t place . . . and then the town",
    "flattens and crumbles behind her, it grows",
    "to dry scrabbled pasture",
    "under a dishplate moon, hanging there",
    "in the tints of the sky, yet like a stopped",
    "clock, right twice a day:",
    "And if the names had sunk beneath the sea,",
    "rolling hump and hollow,",
    "leopard spotted foam\u2014surgeons would haul up",
    "the big sharks and club them silly, knife off a fin,",
    "then drop them",
    "bleeding onto the docks of Alcatraz,",
    "warning the inmates: \u201cSee that?",
    "No inside fin,",
    "they\u2019ll swim round this Rock forever. . . .\u201d",
    "The convicts build the prison, then move inside,",
    "their block minds",
    "ignite a thousand homes by dawn,",
    "then melt in the butter sun of",
    "breakfast porridge. . . .",
    "But this is not the Philosopher\u2019s circle prison,",
    "no lidless Eye radiates from the center,",
    "beneficent",
    "and watchful: the neutered grounds",
    "here at the",
    "are groomed",
    "like the campus of Depression State U:",
    "past the dwarfish berms and drumlins",
    "a mazy cobalt",
    "walkway slithers to the storage lake,",
    "with its hooded fount of",
    "sudsing",
    "the green larvae,",
    "its dry Gazebo Isle no one shuffles to . . .",
    "One night, the distraught",
    "cook",
    "shoots himself dead:",
    "everyone mourns, but only the young staff",
    "seek counseling, their threshold of death",
    "not yet raised",
    "to that of teetering Mr. On-His-Toes,",
    "of Ms. Wheelchair-With-Political-Bumper-Stickers,",
    "or elegant",
    "Mrs. Whisper, polite confused survivors of",
    "wiped-out families, trolley cars, jobs learned",
    "and lost, a cosmos",
    "squeezed beneath the blood boulder\u2014",
    "They do not scream. They who once",
    "made things happen",
    "now watch things happen to them:",
    "they hand their middle chapters to",
    "their children,",
    "and quietly appraise the spindle of",
    "a leafless sapling outside, staked",
    "to three larger",
    "poles of wood: all of them under arrest.",
    "And you must calm yourself. In the acrid hold",
    "of their boat,",
    "whose strangely knotted sail whips the wind",
    "round on each side, anchorless boat",
    "that hugs the dock,",
    "and keeps the dock from drifting to sea,",
    "you can hear the first, reeling chapters,",
    "of pierside painters",
    "crowding a rustic barrel-and-shanty scene",
    "so clich\u00e9d the locals called it \u201cPort Motif",
    "Number One\u201d\u2014:",
    "the washy dab and smear of the medical test,",
    "The brush like an oar rinses off its paints;",
    "a filmy rainbow",
    "upon the waters, coils and ribbons",
    "you trace in your own sweet time."
