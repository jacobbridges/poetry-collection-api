    "So populous the region",
    "That from the next region",
    "The crowing of children, barking of cars could be heard,",
    "So that a continuous linkage",
    "Of sounds of living ran",
    "In the limber air,",
    "District to district, Woodlake to Montclair,",
    "Freestone to Smithfield, and one child\u2019s cry",
    "Was not concealed from any trade route,",
    "Or passer by,",
    "Or upstairs island of thought withdrawn,",
    "Or basement of submerged magnificence.",
    "One crow",
    "Welkened the evening sky,",
    "Bark blasted the dark,",
    "Like an assertion in a time of assent,",
    "Or an increase to astonishment."
