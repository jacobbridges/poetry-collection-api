    "Through the branches of the Japanese cherry",

    "A rain white as the sun",

    "Cuts its square of light",
    "And in it fight",
    "Two figures, hot, irate,",
    "Stuck between sink and sofa in that golden cage.",
    "Come out into the night, walk in the night,",
    "It is for you, not me.",
    "The cherry flowers will rain their rain as white",
    "Cool as the moon.",
    "Listen how they surround.",
    "You swing among them in your cage of light.",
    "Come out into the night."
