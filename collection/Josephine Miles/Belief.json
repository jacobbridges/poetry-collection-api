    "Mother said to call her if the H-bomb exploded",
    "And I said I would, and it about did",
    "When Louis my brother robbed a service station",
    "And lay cursing on the oily cement in handcuffs.",
    "But by that time it was too late to tell Mother,",
    "She was too sick to worry the life out of her",
    "Over",
    ". Causation is sequence",
    "And everything is one thing after another.",
    "Besides, my other brother, Eddie, had got to be President,",
    "And you can't ask too much of one family.",
    "The chances were as good for a good future",
    "As bad for a bad one.",
    "Therefore it was surprising that, as we kept the newspapers from Mother,",
    "She died feeling responsible for a disaster unverified,",
    "Murmuring, in her sleep as it seemed, the ancient slogan"
