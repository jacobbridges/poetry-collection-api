    "How did you come",
    "How did I come here",
    "Now it is ours, how did it come to be",
    "In so many presences?",
    "Some I know swept from the sea, wind and sea,",
    "Took up the right wave in their fins and seal suits,",
    "Rode up over the town to this shore",
    "Shining and sleek",
    "To be caught by a tide",
    "As of music, or color, or shape in the heart of the sea.",
    "Was it you?",
    "Was it you who came out from the sea-floor as lab into lab",
    "Weightless, each breath",
    "Bubbling to surface, swaying in currents of kelp plants,",
    "Came in your cars",
    "Freewayed in valleys millions of miles from the shore",
    "To converge where the highways converge saying",
    ",",
    "And to where?",
    "To tape and percussion, raga computers,",
    "Rare texts and components of clay,",
    "With the sea down away past the freeways and out of the town",
    "To the blockbusting towers of learning and quiet",
    "Shades of administering redwood,",
    "Azure dome over all like a bellflower",
    "And star above star.",
    "Did you come",
    "Out of borderlands dear to the south",
    "Speaking a language Riveran, Nerudan, and saying",
    "\u00e1",
    "; my first lesson?",
    "And come as Quixote, the man of romance",
    "In its new century, tilting",
    "At windmill giants of concrete,",
    "Slim lance at the ready? Woe unto them",
    "That join house to house, that lay field to field",
    "Till there be no place that they may be alone",
    "In the midst of the earth.",
    "Did you come",
    "With a handful of questions",
    "Leaping like jewels",
    "To shock answers, to start",
    "Sparks of inquiry into the evening air?",
    "I came as a kid",
    "From the Midwest all recognize",
    "As part of home,",
    "To this another",
    "Which the salt sea answered in its time",
    "And Viscaino mapped his ports upon.",
    "You came",
    "As concertmaster of hte Philharmonic",
    "As mayor of Del Mar",
    "As reader of magnetic messages in DNA",
    "As archivist for the time\u2019s poetry, or PTA,",
    "As land-grant scholar",
    "Holding his gray moon rocks.",
    "What is this that we come to,",
    "Its walls and corridors",
    "Gaping in space, its north lights",
    "Seeking the north, its substance",
    "Concrete brushed by the grains of its boards,",
    "Its boards reaching extension in all of their lenghts",
    "In architectural solidity?",
    "It is",
    "A break in the galaxies of our imagination. It needs our lives",
    "To make it live.",
    "A building, a dark hole in space,",
    "Compact of matter,",
    "Draws into it buzzing disinterests,",
    "Idelologies.",
    "Incomplete being",
    "Enters into the dense room, emerges",
    "Another, further,",
    "Compact of matter, this is the place that we enter,",
    "It paints pictures here and plays drums.",
    "It turns us around and we emerge",
    "Out of old space into the universe.",
    "This building",
    "Between buildings as between galaxies,",
    "Between fields as between flights of fancy,",
    "Will reshape our ears and turn us,",
    "Our work of art",
    "Beating in the breast like a heart.",
    "What are we here for?",
    "To err,",
    "To fail and attempt as terribly as possible, to try",
    "Stunts of such magnitude they will lead",
    "To disasters of such magnitude they will lead",
    "To learnings of such magnitude they will lend",
    "Back in enterprise to substance and grace.",
    "What learning allows for is the making of error",
    "Without fatality.",
    "The wandering off, the aberration,",
    "Distortion and deviation",
    "By which to find again the steady center",
    "And moving center.",
    "What art allows for is the provisional",
    "Enactments of such learning",
    "In their forms",
    "Of color and line, of mass and energy, of sound",
    "And sense",
    "Which bulk disaster large, create evil",
    "To look it in the eye.",
    "To forge",
    "Villainies of the wars, to indispose",
    "Villainies of petty establishment",
    "To make them lead their lives in sound and sense",
    "To no good end, that we may see them so.",
    "To make mistakes",
    "All of our own mistakes",
    "Out of the huddle of possibilities",
    "Into a color and form which will upbraid them",
    "Beyond their being.",
    "Give us to err",
    "Grandly as possible in this complete",
    "Complex of structure, risk a soul",
    "Nobly in north light, in cello tone,",
    "In action of drastic abandonment,",
    "That we return to what we have abandoned",
    "And make it whole.",
    "Domesticate the brushed",
    "Cement and wood marquee,",
    "Fracture the corridors,",
    "Soften the lights of observation and renew",
    "Structural kindness into its gentler shapes.",
    "Out of the sea",
    "The kelp tangles, out of the south",
    "The cities crowd, out of the sky",
    "The galaxies emerge in isolation",
    "One from another, and the faces here",
    "Look one to antoher in surprise",
    "At what has been made.",
    "Look at the actual",
    "Cliffs and canyons of this place,",
    "People and programs, mass and energy",
    "Of fact,",
    "Look at the possibilities.",
    "Irradiating all these possibilities.",
    "Praise then",
    "The arts of law and science as of life",
    "The arts of sound and substance as of faith",
    "Which claim us here",
    "To take, as a building, as a fiction, takes us,",
    "Into another frame of space",
    "Where we can ponder, celebrate, and reshape",
    "Not only what we are, where we are from,",
    "But what in the risk and moment of our day",
    "We may become."
