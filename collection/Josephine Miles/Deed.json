    "As George Washington hacked at his cherry tree,",

    "This cherry tree",
    "Bent down and nourished the mother and her babe.",
    "As George Washington felled the cherry tree,",
    "Voices of root and stem",
    "Cried out to him",
    "In heavenly accents, but he heard not what they had to say.",
    "Rather, he was making",
    "A clearing in the wilderness,",
    "A subtle discrimination",
    "Of church and state,",
    "By which his little hatchet",
    "Harvested a continental",
    "Bumper crop for Mary",
    "Of natural corn."
