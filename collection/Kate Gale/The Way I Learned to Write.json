    "There were words I had to leave behind,",
    "moonlight, backward ponies.",
    "Leaving flowers out seemed safest.",
    "Trying for something surreal,",
    "A trouble free rise of smoke and lavender.",
    "No not lavender. Any shade",
    "of purple is best left alone.",
    "Perhaps a jaundiced smoke",
    "rising in my poetry",
    "would be best, although I like violet haze.",
    "Many a summer morning,",
    "while other folks are",
    "eating bagels, lox,",
    "cinnamon rolls,",
    "I rummage through old cider houses,",
    "find words like obdurate,",
    "bipolar, manic, cold heeled.",
    "But writing about love, well,",
    "not even searches to junkyards",
    "as far away as Peking",
    "turn up the slightest unused vowel.",
    "So, I make words up, create my own language.",
    "You Chinese me in the roofy mornings.",
    "You Japanese my legs in the spidery evenings.",
    "Our children are the leggy offspring",
    "of centipede afternoons. Our bedroom",
    "is the Acropolis. You temple me backward.",
    "I could bless you all the way to shadowland.",
    "If we were not already steepled there,",
    "our undergarments ruffianed off onto chairs.",
    "You catapulted silence,",
    "dogkissed, catlicked my paws",
    "held my squeaks and rattles.",
    "Where the rest had said, What\u2019s this?",
    "You said, it\u2019s mine."
