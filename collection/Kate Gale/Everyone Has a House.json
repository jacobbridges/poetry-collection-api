    "What I like about your country",

    "but she is not so crazy",
    "about the tortillas",
    "which are not made properly",
    "or the cilantro which tastes like soap",
    "Also the freeways ruin the landscape",
    "and the children watch television",

    "to the children",
    "the children walk by with no respect",
    "mangoes here are not so good",
    "not enough rain",
    "and the women here have so many clothes",
    "I think your country has the most wonderful bathrooms",
    "and everyone has a house",
    "although tents would be nicer",
    "I think or boats",
    "or even just sleeping in a tree",
    "My family has a tree",
    "we live under",
    "but the tree has no toilet",
    "I grant you that."
