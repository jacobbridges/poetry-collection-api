    "The man in the yellow hard hat,",
    "the one with the mask",
    "across his nose and mouth,",
    "pulls the lever that turns",
    "the great arm of the crane up",
    "and over and sideways",
    "toward the earth;",
    "then the wrecking ball",
    "dangles crazily,",
    "so delicately, like a silver fob",
    "loosened from a waistcoat pocket:",
    "shocking to see",
    "the dust fly up and the timber",
    "sail up, then so slowly",
    "down, how the summer air",
    "bristles with a hundred splinters",
    "and the smallest is a splintered flame,",
    "for it takes so many lengthening",
    "erratic movements to tear away",
    "what stands between the sidewalk",
    "and the bell tower,",
    "where the pigeons now rise",
    "in grand indignant waves",
    "at such poor timing, such",
    "a deaf ear toward the music;",
    "in this way the silence",
    "between hand and lever is turned",
    "into a ragged and sorely lifted",
    "wing: the wrecking ball lurches",
    "in a narrowing arc until only",
    "the dust resists\u2014the rest",
    "comes down, story by story,",
    "and is hauled off in flatbed trucks.",
    "Meanwhile the pedestrians come",
    "and go, now and then glancing",
    "at their accurate watches.",
    "Gradually, the dust",
    "becomes the rose light",
    "of autumn.",
    "But one evening a woman",
    "loses her way as she\u2019s",
    "swept into a passing wave",
    "of commuters and she",
    "looks up toward the perfectly",
    "empty rectangle",
    "now hanging between",
    "the rutted mud and the sky.",
    "There along the sides",
    "of the adjacent building,",
    "like a set for a simple",
    "elementary school play,",
    "like the gestures of the dead",
    "in her children\u2019s faces,",
    "she sees the flowered paper",
    "of her parents\u2019 bedroom,",
    "the pink stripes leading",
    "up the stairs to the attic,",
    "and the outline of the claw-",
    "footed bathtub, font",
    "of the lost cathedral of childhood."
