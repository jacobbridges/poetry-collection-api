    "Before balance, before counting, before",
    "The record glistens and the needle slides,",
    "Grating, into the overture, there is the end",
    "Of weight, the leaning into nothing and then",
    "A caught breath, the record listens, the needle slides",
    "Over slowly, and all at once around us a woman\u2019s voice",
    "Stretches weightless, leaning into nothing.",
    "Like a clothesline, the taut chorus: oh, hilarious",
    "Oh baby, all around us, over slowly, a woman\u2019s voice",
    "Gathers above the pick me up, pick me up",
    "And the desperate put, put me down. First the tightrope,",
    "Then the light foot, and the taunting chorus",
    "Pick me up, pick me up. Oh, oh baby.",
    "The slippery floor shimmers and spins like a record while",
    "The light is swinging footloose on its rope",
    "Out of time. The shadows",
    "Slip, shimmering black, and spin across the floor,",
    "Then turn back and pick up again. Oh seedpod stuck for just",
    "One moment on the cattail, out of time, out of shadows,",
    "Downy cheek against a beard: oh scratches",
    "On the record, oh baby, oh measure",
    "Oh strange balance that grips us",
    "On this side of the world."
