    "\ufeffNorthward I came, and knocked in the coated wall",
    "At the door of a low inn scaled like a urinal",
    "With greenish tiles. The door gave, and I came",
    "Home to the stone north, every wynd and snicket",
    "Known to me wherever the flattened cat",
    "Squirmed home to a hole between housewall and paving.",
    "Known! And in the turns of it, no welcome,",
    "No flattery of the beckoned lighted eye",
    "From a Rose of the rose-brick alleys of Toulouse.",
    "Those more than tinsel garlands, more than masks,",
    "Unfading wreaths of ancient summers, I",
    "Sternly cast off. A stern eye is the graceless",
    "Bulk and bruise that at the steep uphill",
    "Confronts me with its drained-of-colour sandstone",
    "Implacably. The Church. It is Good Friday.",
    "Goodbye to the Middle Ages! Although some",
    "Think that I enter them, those centuries",
    "Of monkish superstition, here I leave them",
    "With their true garlands, and their honest masks,",
    "Every fresh flower cast on the porch and trodden,",
    "Raked by the wind at the Church door on this Friday.",
    "Goodbye to all the centuries. There is",
    "No home in them, much as the dip and turn",
    "Of an honest alley charmingly deceive us.",
    "And not yet quite goodbye. Instead almost",
    "Welcome, I said. Bleak equal centuries",
    "Crowded the porch to be deflowered, crowned."
