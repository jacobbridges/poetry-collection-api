    "Imagine, not even or really ever tasting",
    "a peach until well over 50, not once",
    "sympathizing with Blake naked in his garden",
    "insisting on angels until getting off the table",
    "and coming home with my new heart. How absurd",
    "to still have a body in this rainbow-gored,",
    "crickety world and how ridiculous to be given one",
    "in the first place, to be an object",
    "like an orchid is an object, or a stone,",
    "so bruisable and plummeting, arms",
    "waving from the evening-ignited lake,",
    "heading singing in the furnace feral and sweet,",
    "tears that make the face grotesque,",
    "tears that make it pure. How easy",
    "it is now to get drunk on a single whiff",
    "like a hummingbird or ant, on the laughter",
    "of one woman and who knew how much I\u2019d miss",
    "that inner light of snow now that I\u2019m in Texas."
