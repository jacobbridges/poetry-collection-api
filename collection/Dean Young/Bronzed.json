    "That dusty bubble gum, once ubiquitous as starlings,",
    "is no more, my love. Whistling dinosaurs now populate",
    "only animation studios, the furious actions of angels",
    "causing their breasts to flop out in mannerist",
    "frescos flake away as sleet holds us in its teeth.",
    "And the bus-station's old urinals go under",
    "the grindstone and the youthful spelunkers",
    "graduate into the wrinkle-causing sun. The sea",
    "seemingly a constant to the naked eye is one",
    "long goodbye, perpetually the tide recedes,",
    "beaches dotted with debris. Unto each is given",
    "a finite number of addresses, ditties to dart",
    "the heart to its moments of sorrow and swoon.",
    "The sword's hilt glints, the daffodils bow down,",
    "all is temporary as a perfect haircut, a kitten",
    "in the lap, yet sitting here with you, my darling,",
    "waiting for a tuna melt and side of slaw",
    "seems all eternity I'll ever need",
    "and all eternity needs of me."
