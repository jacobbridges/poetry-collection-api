    "Like everyone, I wanted my animal",
    "to be the hawk.",
    "I thought I wanted the strength",
    "to eat the eyes first then tear",
    "into the fuse box of the chest",
    "and soar away.",
    "I needed help because I still",
    "cowered under the shadow of my father,",
    "a man who inspected picture tubes",
    "five out of seven nights,",
    "who woke to breakfast on burnt roast",
    "except the two weeks he\u2019d sleep",
    "on a Jersey beach and throw me",
    "into the gasoline-sheened waves.",
    "I loved him dying indebted",
    "not knowing to what,",
    "thinking his pension would be enough,",
    "released not knowing from what,",
    "gumming at something I was afraid",
    "to get close enough to hear, afraid",
    "of what I was co-signing. So maybe",
    "the elephant. The elephant knows",
    "when one of its own is suffering",
    "up to six miles away. Charges across",
    "the desert cognizant of the futility.",
    "How can I be forgiven when I don\u2019t know",
    "what I need forgiving for? Sometimes",
    "the urges are too extreme: to slap",
    "on the brakes and scream, to bite the haunch",
    "of some passing perfume, so maybe my animal",
    "is the tiger. Or shark.",
    "Or centipede.",
    "But I know I\u2019m smaller than that,",
    "filling notebooks with clumsy versions",
    "of one plaint, one pheromonal call,",
    "clamoring over a crumb that I think",
    "is the world, baffled by the splotch",
    "of one of my own crushed kind,",
    "almost sweet, a sort of tar,",
    "following a trail of one or two molecules,",
    "leaving a trail",
    "of one or two molecules."
