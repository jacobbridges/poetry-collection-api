    "The ugly duckling remained ugly",
    "its whole life but found others",
    "as ugly as itself, I guess that\u2019s the message.",
    "Smoke rises from the heads in the backyard.",
    "Do you think if I hang around here long enough",
    "someone will proffer a muffin,",
    "one skulking shadow to another?",
    "Soon, my shoes will be part of the populous dirt.",
    "Have I learned all the wrong lessons,",
    "the ones you shouldn\u2019t know until",
    "the last dew-clogged lawn is mowed",
    "and the sun goes down on the ruined battlements?",
    "Why was I given a toy train if not",
    "to stage stupendous wrecks? Sure,",
    "I can walk by the sea holding a hand",
    "with as much melancholy as the next fellow,",
    "substituting the cries of slammed waves",
    "for the droll adumbrations of distraught",
    "skeletons, the day taking on the sheen",
    "of a stone removed from the mouth",
    "and skipped between the breakers jubilant and sunk."
