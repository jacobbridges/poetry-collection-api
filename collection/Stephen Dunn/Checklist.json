    "that makes love difficult, brings on",
    "sleep, drops the body off",
    "at the liquor cabinet. All the work",
    "that reaches the intestines and sprawls.",
    "And the compulsive work after the work",
    "is done, those unfillable spaces",
    "of the Calvinist, or certain marriage beds."
