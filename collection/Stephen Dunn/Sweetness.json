    "Just when it has seemed I couldn\u2019t bear",
    "one more friend",
    "waking with a tumor, one more maniac",
    "with a perfect reason, often a sweetness",
    "has come",
    "and changed nothing in the world",
    "except the way I stumbled through it,",
    "for a while lost",
    "in the ignorance of loving",
    "someone or something, the world shrunk",
    "to mouth-size,",
    "hand-size, and never seeming small.",
    "I acknowledge there is no sweetness",
    "that doesn\u2019t leave a stain,",
    "no sweetness that\u2019s ever sufficiently sweet ....",
    "Tonight a friend called to say his lover",
    "was killed in a car",
    "he was driving. His voice was low",
    "and guttural, he repeated what he needed",
    "to repeat, and I repeated",
    "the one or two words we have for such grief",
    "until we were speaking only in tones.",
    "Often a sweetness comes",
    "as if on loan, stays just long enough",
    "to make sense of what it means to be alive,",
    "then returns to its dark",
    "source. As for me, I don\u2019t care",
    "where it\u2019s been, or what bitter road",
    "it\u2019s traveled",
    "to come so far, to taste so good."
