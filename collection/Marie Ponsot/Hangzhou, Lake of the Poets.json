    "Reading the bones, wetting a fingertip",
    "to trace archaic characters, I feel",
    "a breeze of silence flow up past my wrist,",
    "icy. Can I speak here? The bones say I must.",
    "As the first light strikes across the lake, magpies",
    "scream, and the cast bones say the work must come true,",
    "it\u2019s been true all along, we are what we do",
    "out on our digs. Dictor and looker, all eyes,",
    "with spade and a jeweler\u2019s loupe I sift mud & dust",
    "for bone, for shellcast. Spy, archeologist",
    "of freshness, I expect sight-made-sound to reveal",
    "fear cold at the throat of change, and loosen its grip",
    "so that mind, riding the bloodwarm stream, wells up",
    "as the speech that bears it and is telling.",
    "Magpies scream. Though the tongues of birds",
    "say Now and warn forward, free of a live past,",
    "we seek back and forth for change, the ghostly sparkling",
    "of our watertable under everywhere.",
    "If I don\u2019t speak to tap & ease it out,",
    "I go dry & dumb & will die wicked.",
    "On the lake of the poets a stone lamp flickers.",
    "It casts eight moons dancing, casting doubt",
    "on the moon that rides above the winter air.",
    "Ice thaws in a poet\u2019s throat; the springing",
    "truth is fresh. It wakes taste. The taste lasts.",
    "Language floods the mud; mind makes a cast of words;",
    "it precipitates, mercurial, like T\u2019ang discourse",
    "riding the tidal constant of its source."
