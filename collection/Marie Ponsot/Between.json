    "Composed in a shine of laughing, Monique brings in sacks",
    "of groceries, unloads them, straightens, and stretches her back.",
    "The child was a girl, the girl is a woman; the shift",
    "is subtle and absolute, worn like a gift.",
    "The woman, once girl once child, now is deft in her ease,",
    "is door to the forum, is cutter of keys.",
    "In space that her torque and lift have prefigured and set free",
    "between her mother and her child the woman stands",
    "having emptied her hands."
