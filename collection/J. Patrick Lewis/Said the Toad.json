    "I was really in a muddle",
    "looking over a mud puddle",
    "'cause I didn't have a paddle",
    "or a twig to ride the reef.",
    "But I said, Oh, fiddle-faddle,",
    "this is just a little piddle",
    "of a second fiddle puddle",
    "so I saddled up a leaf.",
    "I set sail on the puddle,",
    "but I reached the muddy middle",
    "and I rocked the leaf a little,",
    "then I gave it all I had.",
    "And I solved the mighty riddle",
    "of the whole caboodle puddle",
    "when I hopped up on the middle",
    "of a beetle launching pad."
