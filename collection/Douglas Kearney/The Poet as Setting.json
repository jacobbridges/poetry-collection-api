    "The jolt that comes to bones inside a tumbled streetcar",
    "is what the painter considers as she strokes her-",

    "what he imagines\u2014a lightning bolt, a god tapping",

    "with ceiling fans or the guano of extinct birds,",
    "a jolt riding from his shoulder",
    "blades to his eyelids, dropping with roller",

    "a reader sips (perhaps) a glass of something heady? We give",
    "books spines, we break them. The table will have",
    "its legs, its head. The body is upon us. Does the table have",
    "a stomach? Is it simply there to bear our hunger",
    "without its own, like a eunuch bathing a stripper?",
    "What is the poet without eyes or ears\u2014reading, listening? He is",
    "a platform\u2014a place to set, that to set it with. And if this is",
    "all, what will he do when the reader finishes a glass,",
    "rises from the poet\u2019s head, and passes",
    "into the city? Covered with a linen, he is waiting for",
    "something to spill, perhaps a girl in Mexico rolling",
    "her ankle in a street-",
    "car."
