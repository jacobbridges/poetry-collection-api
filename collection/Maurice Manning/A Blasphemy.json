    "You wouldn't have believed it, how",
    "the man, a little touched perhaps,",
    "set his hands together and prayed",
    "for happiness, yet not his own;",
    "he meant his people, by which he meant",
    "not people really, but trees and cows,",
    "the dirty horses, dogs, the fox",
    "who lived at the back of his place with her kits,",
    "and the very night who settled down",
    "to rock his place to sleep, the place",
    "he tried so hard to tend he found",
    "he mended fences in his sleep.",
    "He said to the you above, who, let's",
    "be honest, doesn't say too much,",
    "I need you now up there to give",
    "my people happiness, you let",
    "them smile and know the reason; hear",
    "my prayer, Old Yam. The you who's you",
    "might laugh at that, and I agree,",
    "it's funny to make a prayer like that,",
    "the down-home words and yonder reach",
    "of what he said; and calling God",
    "the Elder Sweet Potato, shucks,",
    "that's pretty funny, and kind of sad."
