    "Well, this is nothing new, nothing",
    "to rattle the rafters in the noggin,",
    "this moment of remembering",
    "and its kissing cousin the waking dream.",
    "I wonder if I'll remember it?",
    "I've had a vision of a woman",
    "reclining underneath a tree:",
    "she's about half naked and little by little",
    "I'm sprinkling her burial mounds",
    "with grass. This is the kind of work",
    "I like. It lets me remember, and so",
    "I do. I remember the time I laid",
    "my homemade banjo in the fire",
    "and let it burn. There was nothing else",
    "to burn and the house was cold;",
    "the cigar box curled inside the flames.",
    "But the burst of heat was over soon,",
    "and once the little roar was done,",
    "I could hear the raindrops plopping up",
    "the buckets and kettles, scattered out",
    "like little ponds around the room.",
    "It was night and I was a boy, alone",
    "and left to listen to that old music.",
    "I liked it. I've liked it ever since.",
    "I loved the helpless people I loved.",
    "That's what a little boy will do,",
    "but a grown man will turn it all",
    "to sadness and let it soak his heart",
    "until he wrings it out and dreams",
    "about another kind of love,",
    "some afternoon beneath a tree.",
    "Burial mounds\u2014that's hilarious."
