    "I saw I dreamt",
    "Two men hoisted hung up not American the rope",
    "Not closed on their breathing",

    "Suspended",
    "From the mood of a tree not American they were",
    "African Ugandan Nigerian",
    "Without a license a right to touch",
    "The sin their touching incites",
    "And I heard their names called out",
    "and",
    "And",
    "Called up from the mob",
    "Of their mothers their fathers",
    "With Christ in the blood who had Christ in the blood",
    "Who sung out \u201cAbide with Me\u201d",
    "This was my eyes\u2019 closed-eyed vision",
    "This is what a darkness makes",
    "And how did I move from that distance to intimacy",
    "So close I could see",
    "The four soles of their feet so close I was kneeled",
    "Could lick",
    "Those feet as if I was because I became",

    "Feeding but just one shot up",
    "A cry African it was",

    "You had to see how in such lack",
    "Invention takes hold",
    "They say some dreams come in the moment",
    "Of waking",
    "Stitched because daylight likes a story",
    "That some dreams are extensions",
    "Of an itch",
    "Thief-walking the coral of the brain",
    "I say",
    "But I did feel that one blue mouth blow out",
    "As I felt",
    "The mood of that tree",
    "As I saw the other turn away apart stay with silence",
    "I stayed with southern silence"
