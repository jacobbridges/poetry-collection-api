    "Once there was a man who filmed his vacation.",
    "He went flying down the river in his boat",
    "with his video camera to his eye, making",
    "a moving picture of the moving river",
    "upon which his sleek boat moved swiftly",
    "toward the end of his vacation. He showed",
    "his vacation to his camera, which pictured it,",
    "preserving it forever: the river, the trees,",
    "the sky, the light, the bow of his rushing boat",
    "behind which he stood with his camera",
    "preserving his vacation even as he was having it",
    "so that after he had had it he would still",
    "have it. It would be there. With a flick",
    "of a switch, there it would be. But he",
    "would not be in it. He would never be in it."
