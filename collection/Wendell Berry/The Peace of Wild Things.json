    "When despair for the world grows in me",
    "and I wake in the night at the least sound",
    "in fear of what my life and my children\u2019s lives may be,",
    "I go and lie down where the wood drake",
    "rests in his beauty on the water, and the great heron feeds.",
    "I come into the peace of wild things",
    "who do not tax their lives with forethought",
    "of grief. I come into the presence of still water.",
    "And I feel above me the day-blind stars",
    "waiting with their light. For a time",
    "I rest in the grace of the world, and am free."
