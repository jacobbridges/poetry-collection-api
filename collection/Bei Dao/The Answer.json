    "Debasement is the password of the base,",

    "I came into this world",
    "Bringing only paper, rope, a shadow,",
    "To proclaim before the judgment",
    "The voice that has been judged:",

    "If the sea is destined to breach the dikes",
    "Let all the brackish water pour into my heart;",
    "If the land is destined to rise",
    "Let humanity choose a peak for existence again.",
    "A new conjunction and glimmering stars",
    "Adorn the unobstructed sky now;",
    "They are the pictographs from five thousand years.",
    "They are the watchful eyes of future generations."
