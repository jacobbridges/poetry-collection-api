    "This guy I know, a rabbi, Friday nights,",
    "on his way home before sunset in winter,",
    "always stops at a florist or bodega",
    "and buys a bunch of flowers for his wife.",
    "Every week the same, a ritual,",
    "regardless of her mood that morning, fresh",
    "upsets at work, or snarling on the bridge;",
    "he brings her roses wrapped in cellophane.",
    "But isn\u2019t there a ring of hokiness",
    "in that? Why should a good man have to show",
    "his devotion? Some things go unspoken;",
    "some things get tested on the real world,",
    "and isn\u2019t that the place that matters most?",
    "So when you told me I should bring you flowers,",
    "I joked, \u201cBut don\u2019t I show my feelings more",
    "in dog walks, diapers, and rewiring lamps?\u201d",
    "The flowers, I learned later, weren\u2019t for wooing,",
    "not for affection in long marriage, but",
    "for something seeded even deeper down,",
    "through frost heaves, and which might be, roughly, peace.",
    "(It\u2019s funny that I just assumed romance.)",
    "Now there\u2019s no peace with us. I wonder what",
    "they might have meant to you, those simple tokens,",
    "holding in sight what no rite can grow back."
