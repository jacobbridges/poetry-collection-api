    "Now everywhere the pageantry of youth",
    "is on display:",
    "The squeal of bike chains spinning through the gray",
    "plays fugue to puddle-froth;",
    "The punctual blitz of hyacinths in April",
    "ushers spring",
    "with lavender dripped from the upturned wing",
    "of wind-swept Gabriel.",
    "A youngish pair walks wired at the arms\u2014",
    "she casually ribbing",
    "him, he lightly brushing her breast, jibbing",
    "their step to spare the worms",
    "stranded along the road. Too soon, their laughter",
    "rises and goes",
    "drifting toward silence. And now the young man knows",
    "love\u2019s not the song, but after\u2014",
    "like the mute, remembered chorus of the rain",
    "that stains the walk",
    "long after falling, or the lifeless stalk",
    "still hoisting its head of grain.",
    "Uneasy now, she loosens from his hand.",
    "Their dark familiars",
    "stare back, reflected by the passing cars,",
    "with speechless reprimand.",
    "Before the chill, each chartered hell grows hotter,",
    "yet every burn",
    "will teach him how to run\u2014and how to turn",
    "her wine back into water."
