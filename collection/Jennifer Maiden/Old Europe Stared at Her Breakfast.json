    "Old Europe stared at her breakfast,",

    "which tasted like a gun",

    "always happens' more and more, hoped",
    "for example, that the fact that the 'plant'",
    "for weapons in Northern Iraq was shown",
    "on the BBC an empty ex-Media",
    "Centre, and miles away a plain village,",
    "hoping not to be bombed, because by",
    "mistake young Colin, who apparently",
    "mistook often, used its name",
    "at the UN as that of the 'plant',",
    "would be accepted as a fact and then",
    "protected, thought Old Europe",
    "as her France loved to protect facts,",
    "as her Germany to act, or her Belgium to be. But,",
    "she reflected, in doubt and in debt,",
    "the future is not an ally",
    "over the sea which just needs to be",
    "convinced but a masked soldier, dead",
    "to Agincourt, Darmstadt, Verdun,",
    "wanting oil and meat and not",
    "understanding how a continental breakfast",
    "keeps the blood in your head, your brain",
    "not your gut. Old Europe set her spine",
    "straight in the doorway sun. Her hand",
    "crumbled bread as if it were old bone."
