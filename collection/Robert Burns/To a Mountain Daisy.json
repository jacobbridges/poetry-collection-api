    "Wee, modest, crimson-tipp\u00e8d flow'r,",
    "Thou's met me in an evil hour;",
    "For I maun crush amang the stoure",
    "Thy slender stem:",
    "To spare thee now is past my pow'r,",
    "Thou bonie gem.",
    "Alas! it's no thy neibor sweet,",
    "The bonie lark, companion meet,",
    "Bending thee 'mang the dewy weet",
    "Wi' spreck'd breast,",
    "When upward-springing, blythe, to greet",
    "The purpling east.",
    "Cauld blew the bitter-biting north",
    "Upon thy early, humble birth;",
    "Yet cheerfully thou glinted forth",
    "Amid the storm,",
    "Scarce rear'd above the parent-earth",
    "Thy tender form.",
    "The flaunting flowers our gardens yield",
    "High shelt'ring woods an' wa's maun shield:",
    "But thou, beneath the random bield",
    "O' clod or stane,",
    "Adorns the histie stibble-field",
    "Unseen, alane.",
    "There, in thy scanty mantle clad,",
    "Thy snawie-bosom sun-ward spread,",
    "Thou lifts thy unassuming head",
    "In humble guise;",
    "But now the share uptears thy bed,",
    "And low thou lies!",
    "Such is the fate of artless maid,",
    "Sweet flow'ret of the rural shade!",
    "By love's simplicity betray'd",
    "And guileless trust;",
    "Till she, like thee, all soil'd, is laid",
    "Low i' the dust.",
    "Such is the fate of simple bard,",
    "On life's rough ocean luckless starr'd!",
    "Unskilful he to note the card",
    "Of prudent lore,",
    "Till billows rage and gales blow hard,",
    "And whelm him o'er!",
    "Such fate to suffering Worth is giv'n,",
    "Who long with wants and woes has striv'n,",
    "By human pride or cunning driv'n",
    "To mis'ry's brink;",
    "Till, wrench'd of ev'ry stay but Heav'n,",
    "He ruin'd sink!",
    "Ev'n thou who mourn'st the Daisy's fate,",
    "That fate is thine\u2014no distant date;",
    "Stern Ruin's ploughshare drives elate,",
    "Full on thy bloom,",
    "Till crush'd beneath the furrow's weight",
    "Shall be thy doom."
