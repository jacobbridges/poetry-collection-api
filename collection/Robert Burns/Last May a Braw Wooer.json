    "The Lord forgie me for liein, for liein,",
    "The Lord forgie me for liein!",
    "A weel-stocked mailen, himsel for the laird,",
    "And marriage aff-hand, were his proffers:",

    "Guess ye how, the jad! I could bear her, could bear her",
    "Guess ye how, the jad! I could bear her.",
    "But a' the niest week I fretted wi' care,",
    "I gaed to the tryste o' Dalgarnock,",
    "And wha but my fine fickle lover was there,",
    "I glowr'd as I'd seen a warlock, a warlock.",
    "I glowr'd as I'd seen a warlock.",
    "But owre my left shoulder I gae him a blink,",
    "Lest neibors might say I was saucy;",
    "My wooer he caper'd as he'd been in drink,",
    "And vow'd I was his dear lassie, dear lassie,",
    "And vow'd I was his dear lassie.",
    "I spier'd for my cousin fu' couthy and sweet,",
    "Gin she had recover'd her hearin,",
    "And how her new shoon fit her auld shachl't feet\u2014",
    "But, heavens! how he fell a swearin, a swearin,",
