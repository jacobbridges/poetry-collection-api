    "Auld Coila now may fidge fu' fain,",
    "She's gotten poets o' her ain\u2014",
    "Chiels wha their chanters winna hain,",
    "But tune their lays,",
    "Till echoes a' resound again",
    "Her weel-sung praise.",
    "Nae poet thought her worth his while",
    "To set her name in measur'd style:",
    "She lay like some unken'd-of isle",
    "Beside New Holland,",
    "Or whare wild-meeting oceans boil",
    "Besouth Magellan.",
    "Ramsay and famous Fergusson",
    "Gied Forth and Tay a lift aboon;",
    "Yarrow and Tweed to mony a tune",
    "Owre Scotland rings;",
    "While Irvin, Lugar, Ayr an' Doon",
    "Naebody sings.",
    "Th' Ilissus, Tiber, Thames, an' Seine",
    "Glide sweet in mony a tunefu' line;",
    "But, Willie, set your fit to mine",
    "And cock your crest,",
    "We'll gar our streams and burnies shine",
    "Up wi' the best!",
    "We'll sing auld Coila's plains an' fells,",
    "Her moors red-brown wi' heather bells,",
    "Her banks an' braes, her dens an' dells,",
    "Where glorious Wallace",
    "Aft bure the gree, as story tells,",
    "Frae Southron billies.",
    "At Wallace' name what Scottish blood",
    "But boils up in a spring-tide flood!",
    "Oft have our fearless fathers strode",
    "By Wallace' side,",
    "Still pressing onward red-wat-shod,",
    "Or glorious dy'd.",
    "O sweet are Coila's haughs an' woods,.",
    "When lintwhites chant amang the buds,",
    "And jinkin hares in amorous whids",
    "Their loves enjoy,",
    "While thro' the braes the cushat croods",
    "Wi' wailfu' cry!",
    "Ev'n winter bleak has charms to me,",
    "When winds rave thro' the naked tree;",
    "Or frosts on hills of Ochiltree",
    "Are hoary gray;",
    "Or blinding drifts wild-furious flee,",
    "Dark'ning the day!",
    "O Nature! a' thy shews an' forms",
    "To feeling, pensive hearts hae charms!",
    "Whether the summer kindly warms",
    "Wi' life an' light,",
    "Or winter howls in gusty storms",
    "The lang, dark night!",
    "The Muse, nae poet ever fand her,",
    "Till by himsel he learn'd to wander",
    "Adoun some trottin burn's meander,",
    "And no think lang;",
    "O sweet to stray and pensive ponder",
    "A heart-felt sang!",
    "The warly race may drudge and drive,",
    "Hog-shouther, jundie, stretch an' strive:",
    "Let me fair nature's face descrive,",
    "And I wi' pleasure",
    "Shall let the busy, grumbling hive",
    "Bum owre their treasure."
