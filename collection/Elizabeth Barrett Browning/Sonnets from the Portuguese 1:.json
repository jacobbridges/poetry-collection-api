    "I thought once how Theocritus had sung",
    "Of the sweet years, the dear and wished for years,",
    "Who each one in a gracious hand appears",
    "To bear a gift for mortals, old or young:",
    "And, as I mused it in his antique tongue,",
    "I saw, in gradual vision through my tears,",
    "The sweet, sad years, the melancholy years,",
    "Those of my own life, who by turns had flung",
    "A shadow across me. Straightway I was 'ware,",
    "So weeping, how a mystic Shape did move",
    "Behind me, and drew me backward by the hair,",
    "And a voice said in mastery, while I strove, ...",
    "Guess now who holds thee?'\u2014Death,' I said. But there,",
    "The silver answer rang ... Not Death, but Love.'"
