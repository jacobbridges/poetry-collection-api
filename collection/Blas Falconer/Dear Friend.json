    "Your bags were packed",
    "and left at the door, the vase you",
    "filled with shells, wrapped in tissue,",
    "your books boxed. I have the whelk",
    "you found on shore, the small conch,",
    "intact\u2014the point, the fine grooves\u2014",
    "and keep it in a box with a picture of you",
    "at the beach: your hair slicked back,",
    "head cocked at an angle.",
    "Behind you, the green jacket",
    "you told me to throw away. Strewn",
    "over a chair, its arms dangle",
    "above the floor\u2014a hole in the pocket,",
    "the elbows thin from years of use.",
    "Y.",
    "I become each day more reckless,",
    "too impatient for summer, the unbearable heat,",
    "the calm that comes with it. There are no hills here,",
    "not one, and I\u2019m bored with the stillness",
    "of the yellow field outside my window. And you,",
    "who cannot keep still, who can never",
    "look back, where will you go next?",
    "How will I find you?",
    "Can you feel the world pull",
    "apart, the seams loosen?",
    "What, tell me, will keep it whole,",
    "if not you? if not me?",
    "Send a postcard, picture, tell me",
    "how you\u2019ve been.",
    "Z.",
    "Running down the stairwell in the garden,",
    "I divide the steps by three, until my",
    "foot catches the edge, wet with rain, and my",
    "frame, flung forward by its own momentum,",
    "leans into the night as if reaching",
    "for something I didn\u2019t know I",
    "wanted. Not the moon. No. Not the sky,",
    "suspended and limitless. Not even",
    "the tulips standing on their stems",
    "(their petals cup the air).",
    "But in the streetlamp\u2019s circle of light, I land",
    "among them, broken.",
    "My body can\u2019t contain",
    "itself, as blood burgeons in my hands."
