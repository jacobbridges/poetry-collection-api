    "Lusty Youth should us ensue,",
    "His merry heart shall sure all rue.",
    "For whatsoever they do him tell,",
    "It is not for him, we know it well.",
    "For they would have him his Liberty refrain",
    "And all merry company for to disdain,",
    "But I will not so whatsoever they say,",
    "But follow his mind in all that we may.",
    "How should Youth himself best use",
    "But all disdainers for to refuse?",
    "Youth has, as chief assurance,",
    "Honest Mirth with Virtue's pastance.",
    "For in them consisteth great honour,",
    "Though that disdainers would therein put error,",
    "For they do sue to get them grace",
    "All only riches to purchase.",
    "With Good Order, Counsel, and Equity,",
    "Good Lord, grant us our mansion to be!",
    "For without their good guidance",
    "Youth should fall in great mischance.",
    "For Youth is frail and prompt to do,",
    "As well vices as virtues to ensue.",
    "Wherefore by these he must be guided",
    "And Virtue's pastance must be therein used.",
    "Now unto God this prayer we make,",
    "That this rude play may well be take,",
    "And that we may our faults amend,",
    "An bliss obtain at our last end."
