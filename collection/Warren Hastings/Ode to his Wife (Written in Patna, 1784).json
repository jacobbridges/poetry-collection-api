    "And now, my Marian, from its shackles free,",
    "My wearied fancy turns for ease to thee;",
    "To thee, my compass through life\u2019s varied stream,",
    "My constant object, and unfailing theme.",
    "Torn from the bosom of my soul\u2019s repose,",
    "And self-devoted to surrounding woes,",
    "Oft o\u2019er my solitary thoughts I brood\u2014",
    "(For passing crowds to me are solitude)\u2014",
    "Catch thy loved image, on thy beauties dwell,",
    "Improved by graces which no tongue can tell,",
    "The look which I have seen, by love endeared,",
    "The voice to love attuned, which I have heard.",
    "Or rapt in thoughts of higher worth, adore",
    "Thy virtues, drawn by mem\u2019ry\u2019s faithful store;",
    "Or court, as now obsequious at her shrine,",
    "The Muse, unkind on ev\u2019ry theme but thine.",
    "Nor foreign deem from such a frame of mind",
    "This tale, to meet thy gracious ear designed,",
    "To me, and to my state, alike belong",
    "The subject, and the moral, of my song,",
    "\u2019Tis true, no serpent of envenomed breath",
    "Hath stung my love, ere yet a bride, to death;",
    "And, O! may Heav\u2019n for many years to come,",
    "Preserve her life from Nature\u2019s final doom!",
    "Yet is she lost to me, in substance dead,",
    "With half the traversed globe between us spread;",
    "Dreadful transition! in one moment\u2019s cost",
    "My soul\u2019s whole wealth I saw, and held, and lost.",
    "The Fate and Silence closed life\u2019s blissful scene,",
    "Its being past, as it had never been.",
    "The sad rememberance only now remains,",
    "And by contrasting aggravates my pains.",
    "Hope still attendant and delusive stands,",
    "And points, but coldly points, to distant lands;",
    "Gilds their faint summits with her flatt\u2019ring ray;",
    "But deserts, rocks, and seas obstruct the way;",
    "And age, and sickness, and the clouds that teem",
    "With unknown thunders, through the prospect gleam.",
    "Ah me! no Gods, nor Angels now descend,",
    "The sons of men in pity to befriend!",
    "My sufferings else might some kind spirit move",
    "To give me back on terms the wife I love:",
    "And more than half my life would I resign,",
    "For health, her purchase, and herself, for mine,",
    "Borne by the Pow\u2019rs of Air, or she should rise,",
    "Or I rejoin her through the distant skies.",
    "No more my thoughts in solitude should mourn",
    "My sweet companion from my presence torn;",
    "Nor rigid duty force me to remain,",
    "And see her sails diminish on the main.",
    "To her my destined hours, though few, I\u2019d give,",
    "And while I lived, a life of bliss I\u2019d live."
