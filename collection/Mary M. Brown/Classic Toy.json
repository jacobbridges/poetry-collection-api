    "The plastic army men are always green.",
    "They\u2019re caught in awkward poses,",
    "one arm outstretched as if to fire,",
    "legs parted and forever stuck on a swiggle",
    "of support, as rigid and green as the boots.",
    "This one has impressions of pockets,",
    "a belt, a collar, a grip on tiny binoculars",
    "intended to enlarge, no doubt, some",
    "tiny enemy.",
    "In back, attached to the belt is a canteen",
    "or a grenade (it\u2019s hard to tell). The helmet",
    "is pulled down low, so as to hide the eyes.",
    "If I point the arm, the gun, toward me,",
    "I see that this soldier is very thin.",
    "It\u2019s almost unreal, how thin he is."
