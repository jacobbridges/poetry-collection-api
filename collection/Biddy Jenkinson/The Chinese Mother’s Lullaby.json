    "Pull in your feet, little darling,",
    "so I can kiss your wee trotters",
    "while I fold under a toe",
    "and another one underneath.",
    "I bend a little piggie.",
    "I bend another little piggie",
    "And look at that naughty little piggie",
    "that is still sticking out.",
    "Now, now, my treasure,",
    "there is work to be done here.",
    "Your toes like fairy thimbles,",
    "the blossom of the foxglove.",
    "Like a calf that is spancelled",
    "or a hobble on a chicken,",
    "there will be swaddlings of silk",
    "on the feet of my dear.",
    "That my daughter now shrieks",
    "like a blue jay is no matter,",
    "she will sway in the future",
    "like a bamboo on a windy day",
    "or like a willow sapling.",
    "So I bend under the big toe",
    "and another toe after",
    "to form a foot like a lotus",
    "about to unfold.",
    "Poor Cliodhna has flat feet.",
    "Maire has huge ones.",
    "Peggy\u2019s are like spades",
    "and Niamh\u2019s like two rakes.",
    "Just hold still, my dearie,",
    "while I tighten your bindings.",
    "I\u2019m only your mammy",
    "doing my very best for your sake"
