    "the ideal city building itself in his brain.",
    "Is this mile magnificent? He\u2019s lived here",
    "a while, but the mile feels unreal. Robinson\u2019s",
    "training himself to act blas\u00e9. Do museums",
    "amuse me? Yes, but not today. Would he",
    "like to be in one? Of course. Why not?",
    "An object of value with canvas wings,",
    "an unchanging face in a gilt frame, arranged\u2014",
    "thoughtless, guilt-free, & preserved",

    "the way you chill a glass, Robinson passes",
    "the National Academy. He craves a sense",
    "of belonging, not to always be longing. To be",
    "standing in a doorway, incredibly kissable,",
    "not waiting at the four-way, eminently missable.",
    "Is this mile magnanimous? He wants it",
    "unanimous: that this is his kind of town\u2014",
    "up & down & including Brooklyn. The sky",
    "is clearing, but the isolation sticks.",
    "Robinson\u2019s not sure what a camera obscura",
    "is for, but he thinks he should have",
    "his portrait done with one. Faces",
    "blur by as he heads toward the Frick.",
    "Something used to photograph the obscure."
