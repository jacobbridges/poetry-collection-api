    "I have to thank God I'm a woman,",
    "For in these ordered days a woman only",
    "Is free to be very hungry, very lonely.",
    "It is sad for Feminism, but still clear",
    "That man, more often than woman, is pioneer.",
    "If I would confide a new thought,",
    "First to a man must it be brought.",
    "Now, for our sins, it is my bitter fate",
    "That such a man wills soon to be my mate,",
    "And so of friendship is quick end:",
    "When I have gained a love I lose a friend.",
    "It is well within the order of things",
    "That man should listen when his mate sings;",
    "But the true male never yet walked",
    "Who liked to listen when his mate talked.",
    "I would be married to a full man,",
    "As would all women since the world began;",
    "But from a wealth of living I have proved",
    "I must be silent, if I would be loved.",
    "Now of my silence I have much wealth,",
    "I have to do my thinking all by stealth.",
    "My thoughts may never see the day;",
    "My mind is like a catacomb where early Christians pray.",
    "And of my silence I have much pain,",
    "But of these pangs I have great gain;",
    "For I must take to drugs or drink,",
    "Or I must write the things I think.",
    "If my sex would let me speak,",
    "I would be very lazy and most weak;",
    "I should speak only, and the things I spoke",
    "Would fill the air awhile, and clear like smoke.",
    "The things I think now I write down,",
    "And some day I will show them to the Town.",
    "When I am sad I make thought clear;",
    "I can re-read it all next year.",
    "I have to thank God I'm a woman,",
    "For in these ordered days a woman only",
    "Is free to be very hungry, very lonely."
