    "As if the flow of the waters",
    "From the triple streams of heavenly showers",
    "So the sacred Ao of the eighth heavens",
    "Whose flames have scorched the land.",
    "Should our hearts\u2019 love be restored",
    "And our rights be ours once more",
    "Then will our sacred beloved shoals of Kane",
    "Be the firm foundation of the land.",
    "The heavens expand and bestow",
    "Her beauteous crownlets free",
    "Its life to her people for offerings given",
    "And from loyal hearts ascended prayers.",
    "Cold words and looks reprove",
    "Oh, turn not thus away",
    "Give kindly greetings, words of love",
    "And a heart which beats within."
