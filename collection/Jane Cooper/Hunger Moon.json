    "The last full moon of February",
    "stalks the fields; barbed wire casts a shadow.",
    "Rising slowly, a beam moved toward the west",
    "stealthily changing position",
    "until now, in the small hours, across the snow",
    "it advances on my pillow",
    "to wake me, not rudely like the sun",
    "but with the cocked gun of silence.",
    "I am alone in a vast room",
    "where a vain woman once slept.",
    "The moon, in pale buckskins, crouches",
    "on guard beside her bed.",
    "Slowly the light wanes, the snow will melt",
    "and all the fences thrum in the spring breeze",
    "but not until that sleeper, trapped",
    "in my body, turns and turns."
