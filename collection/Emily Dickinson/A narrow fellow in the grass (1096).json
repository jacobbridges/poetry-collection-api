    "A narrow fellow in the grass",
    "Occasionally rides;",
    "You may have met him\u2014did you not",
    "His notice sudden is,",
    "The grass divides as with a comb,",
    "A spotted shaft is seen,",
    "And then it closes at your feet,",
    "And opens further on.",
    "He likes a boggy acre,",
    "A floor too cool for corn,",
    "But when a boy and barefoot,",
    "I more than once at noon",
    "Have passed, I thought, a whip lash,",
    "Unbraiding in the sun,",
    "When stooping to secure it,",
    "It wrinkled and was gone.",
    "Several of nature\u2019s people",
    "I know, and they know me;",
    "I feel for them a transport",
    "Of cordiality.",
    "But never met this fellow,",
    "Attended or alone,",
    "Without a tighter breathing,",
    "And zero at the bone."
