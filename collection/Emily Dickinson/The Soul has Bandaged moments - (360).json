    "The Soul has Bandaged moments -",
    "When too appalled to stir -",
    "She feels some ghastly Fright come up",
    "And stop to look at her -",
    "Salute her, with long fingers -",
    "Caress her freezing hair -",
    "Sip, Goblin, from the very lips",
    "The Lover - hovered - o'er -",
    "Unworthy, that a thought so mean",
    "Accost a Theme - so - fair -",
    "The soul has moments of escape -",
    "When bursting all the doors -",
    "She dances like a Bomb, abroad,",
    "And swings opon the Hours,",
    "As do the Bee - delirious borne -",
    "Long Dungeoned from his Rose -",
    "Touch Liberty - then know no more -",
    "But Noon, and Paradise",
    "The Soul's retaken moments -",
    "When, Felon led along,",
    "With shackles on the plumed feet,",
    "And staples, in the song,",
    "The Horror welcomes her, again,",
    "These, are not brayed of Tongue -"
