    "Surely there are teeth so small.",
    "I have listened for their turning,",
    "this frail swell and fall",
    "like old blood yearning",
    "upwards through the skin of days.",
    "Slowly, I am learning",
    "their count, though numbers fray",
    "in me, and the loaded instants",
    "graft, coming always",
    "to the same tangle: the distant",
    "cry merging with the song",
    "at hand, the rain\u2019s insistent",
    "opening in daylong",
    "dryness, the plain moon",
    "draining into dawn.",
    "And below it all, hewn",
    "from the pliant light of some",
    "Geneva noon,",
    "they spin time\u2019s thrum.",
    "Stopped, I have bent my ears",
    "to them. I have become",
    "sound inside their years.",
    "Surely I have known the whole",
    "of grief and grace in gears."
