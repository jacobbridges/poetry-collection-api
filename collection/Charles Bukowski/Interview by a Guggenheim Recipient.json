    "this South American up here on a Gugg",
    "walked in with his whore",
    "and she sat on the edge of my bed and",
    "crossed her fine legs",
    "and I kept looking at her legs",
    "and he pulled at his stringy necktie",
    "and I had a hangover",
    "and he asked me",
    "WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THE AMERICAN",
    "POETS?",
    "and I told him I didn\u2019t think very much",
    "of the American poets",
    "and then he went on to ask some other",
    "very dull questions",
    "(as his whore\u2019s legs layed along the side of",
    "my brain) like",
    "WELL? YOU DON\u2019T CARE ABOUT ANYTHING",
    "BUT IF YOU WERE TEACHING A CLASS AND ONE OF THE",
    "STUDENTS ASKED YOU WHICH AMERICAN POETS",
    "THEY SHOULD READ",
    "WHAT WOULD YOU TELL THEM?",
    "she crossed her legs as I watched and I thought",
    "I could knock him out with one punch",
    "rape her in 4 minutes",
    "catch a train for L.A.",
    "get off in Arizona and walk off into the desert",
    "and I couldn\u2019t tell him that I would never teach",
    "a class",
    "that along with not liking American poetry",
    "that I didn\u2019t like American classes either",
    "or the job that they would expect me to",
    "do,",
    "so I said",
    "Whitman, T.S. Eliot, D.H. Lawrence\u2019 poems about",
    "reptiles and beasts, Auden. and then I",
    "realized that Whitman was the only true American,",
    "that Eliot was not an American somehow and the",
    "others certainly not, and",
    "he knew it too",
    "he knew that I had fucked up",
    "but I made no apologies",
    "thought some more about rape",
    "I almost loved the woman but I knew that when she walked out",
    "that I would never see her again",
    "and we shook hands and the Gugg said",
    "he\u2019d send me the article when it came out",
    "but I knew that he didn\u2019t have an article",
    "and he knew it too",
    "and then he said",
    "I will send you some of my poems translated into",
    "English",
    "and I said fine",
    "and I watched them walk out of the place",
    "I watched her highheels clack down the tall",
    "green steps",
    "and then both of them were gone",
    "but I kept remembering her dress sliding all over her",
    "like a second skin",
    "and I was wild with mourning and love and sadness",
    "and being a fool unable to",
    "communicate",
    "anything",
    "and I walked in and finished that beer",
    "cracked another",
    "put on my ragged king\u2019s coat",
    "and walked out into the New Orleans street",
    "and that very night",
    "I sat with my friends and acted vile and",
    "the ass",
    "much mouth and villainy",
    "and cruelness",
    "and they never",
    "knew why."
