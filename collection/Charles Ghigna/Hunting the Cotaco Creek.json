    "His hand in hold so trigger-tight its blood",
    "believes in ghosts. It clings with finger set",
    "on steel and waits inside a dream of ducks.",
    "The twilight burns into a rising arc",
    "of eastern sky as sun reveals herself",
    "too proud and instantly receives full-face",
    "a splash of mallard flock. A shotgun blasts",
    "the yellow into streaming pinks and gives",
    "the creek its new-day taste of echoed blood.",
    "Two green head ghosts fly through the pulse of dawn",
    "upon a trigger\u2019\ufeffs touch. The creek empties",
    "of sound. In silence human fingers find",
    "wet feet of web and carry in each hand",
    "a bird whose only cry comes in color."
