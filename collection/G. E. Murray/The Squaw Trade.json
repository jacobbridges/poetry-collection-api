    "1",
    "Slime burlap on timbers riverside, yea",
    "More captive berths to consider: boundaries",
    "Set by familar propositions",
    "Of comfort and flatbottom mud. We men",
    "Haul up some miracle of a ditch",
    "To what\u2019s called Squaw Island.",
    "And such remains the canalman\u2019s trade",
    "At last. Harsh ways, we tell you,",
    "Woman, your eyes and rapture averted",
    "To the long boats pulled in tandem",
    "To your door. How could we see then",
    "How it was always us alone\u2014",
    "Unknown stations in need of poor launch?",
    "2",
    "If they could sing or even listen",
    "A little, we\u2019d be lost deep in the pitch",
    "And rumble of real lives, primed",
    "To unload a pledge or two of return.",
    "One day, under the shadow of hawks,",
    "We locked in the long grass",
    "As if slugs. The aftermath was quick",
    "Parting, forever maybe, then back",
    "To our stories of the packet boat",
    "Whacking through tangle reeds",
    "And the stoop-backed Irish turning mythic",
    "In this, a speechless country,",
    "Almost mysterious as perfume itself.",
    "3",
    "Captivated at Little Falls, gone clean",
    "By Weedsport, pressing toward",
    "Those vainglorious times up in Lowertown",
    "Where we\u2019d stroll the day, liquor",
    "In hand, waiting a turn at the Locks.",
    "It should be allowed as how girls",
    "Were not forgotten, either. Sure",
    "In any faint light setting off-island,",
    "You see the hair\u2019s worn from their legs",
    "By woolen trousers. Odd why",
    "Such standard gossip keeps us",
    "Huddled around cigar smoke and fun,",
    "Ever shuffling, ready again to move soon.",
    "4",
    "After miles of stumps and clear-cut skies,",
    "More stumps. And the deadly matter",
    "Of building country in the calm of summer",
    "Burdens like a search for much worse.",
    "Thinking through a warm afternoon rain,",
    "Thinking of getting there, downwater",
    "Toward neglect for glory\u2019s sake",
    "And other never-lasting bounty,",
    "A blessing, it seems, becomes this\u2014",
    "All passages so unworldly hot",
    "As to be bitter, our own massive bones",
    "Sweating. O Motherly touch and need,",
    "What have we to do with thee?",
    "5",
    "Just nervous, and the skirtless brides",
    "Seem just the same. At the taking",
    "Of shore, there\u2019s care for the prize",
    "Portraiture of a girl at sixteen in your vest,",
    "Driving you mad, and on. It\u2019s a gravity",
    "In the blood, unchangeable as the waif",
    "You are, a dwarf among dwarfs, no force.",
    "They tell you they understand. So half",
    "The time so drunk as to see, you wear",
    "Your life like a bandanna. That\u2019s all",
    "Nobody\u2019s business. That\u2019s all the secret",
    "There is. But to any woman\u2019s edges,",
    "Rubbed soft as landscape, you are less.",
    "6",
    "Kissing that last sure drop of sweat",
    "From a heavy lip, tongues wag easy",
    "In this good composted land",
    "Amid mire and flesh, a threat of snow.",
    "We rise from a hut born",
    "To game and holiday, knowing barely",
    "Ourselves. None of us escape",
    "The terrible progress we make",
    "Suffering yet another pleasure.",
    "Sad, say, the ways we loved like stones\u2014",
    "No courting dance, no feathers",
    "Or gesture. But then nobody asked",
    "For more than favors or strange luck.",
    "7",
    "They watch for clouds. Any muster",
    "Could ruin business, however damp",
    "Already the shining caves that bristle",
    "Like pearl in moonlight. Beneath their belts",
    "The sources of circumstance and invention",
    "Turn nightfall to a wash. Lacking",
    "A westerly push toward Erie, the hide",
    "Tingles for a pressure, a sign,",
    "If only the whine of a full day\u2019s water",
    "Lost to Niagara. In fair time,",
    "The swell might thicken and warm",
    "As soup in the casual hands",
    "Of a visitor aging to unwelcome weathers.",
    "8",
    "So it\u2019s Buffalo: gutspill and sideshow,",
    "Crusade of rascals swaggering",
    "Up Front Street. Lovey, it all passes forth\u2014",
    "The heart\u2019s infirmities, our grinding",
    "Labors .... Who hasn\u2019t spent a life",
    "Making civilization right and not",
    "Gone wrong? Soon there\u2019ll be other empires,",
    "Then farther west, further refinements",
    "Of the breed. We conclude here,",
    "A rainy frontier, end of a pity. What\u2019s more?",
    "Ah, dreaming, we\u2019d scheme of strangers",
    "Above our sorry place, wise builders erecting",
    "Able love some hundred years hence!",
    "9",
    "Like a hatch of horseflies streaming",
    "Into gray light, we\u2019ve grown free to cross",
    "The flushing river on abundant piping",
    "Of sludge. Where\u2019s the barrelhouse,",
    "The waste of laughter and bile that releases?",
    "Instead there\u2019s a world piled on bedrock,",
    "A history failing its horizons,",
    "Properties of muck increased by modern",
    "Wealth. We\u2019re where the lost bodies",
    "Of unshared spheres intertwine",
    "As a distant rescue from style and form,",
    "From tales left squalid in the telling:",
    "Now just a vigilance, faith\u2019s fallen banner ...."
