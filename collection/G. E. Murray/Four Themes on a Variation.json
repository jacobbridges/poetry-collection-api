    "While nothing satisfies, not morning\u2019s",
    "Bleary mirror or the slick embrace at hand,",
    "Consider our mutual jewel an untouching, a pouring",
    "Into sweet emptied arms called worth and habit.",
    "Hey, you there, change of mind, eh?",
    "So, it is these comic-book poses that promise",
    "Softer years, quite bearable as amnesia or sex.",
    "Tough talkers, their brain-pans fried black",
    "From a constant heat, turn out swell",
    "On the boulevard strolling in evening wear.",
    "Appearances being unavoidable",
    "As the urge to keep tuned, even stars",
    "Seems to itch for more, for a squeeze",
    "Of all our drizzling nothings, save time.",
    "Leaning out from this wayside planet,",
    "You witness another life blown like glass",
    "Without pattern or fatuous secret,",
    "Yet a limited edition of uncertain radius.",
    "Presume then to be home, a part dismantled",
    "By continuity; some guiding light",
    "Phasing on and off like an unoriginal religion.",
    "Get far up and hard in the hole",
    "Between dead of winter skies and beyond",
    "Limits of ourselves documented by precinct,",
    "Greeted cordially by scandal. Too soon",
    "Allegiance becomes resistance and otherwise;",
    "Meanwhile, after a holy pinch in the ass",
    "You are often saved and, perhaps, in love."
