    "You hear the roadhouse before you see it,",
    "Its four-beat country tunes",
    "Amplified like surf through the woods,",
    "Silencing bullfrog and red-tailed hawk,",
    "Setting beards of moss dancing",
    "On dim, indeterminate trees",
    "That border two-lane blacktop.",
    "Docked tonight, you reveal the badge",
    "Of the farmer, that blanched expanse of skin",
    "Where cap shades face, babyhood",
    "Pallor above the sun-blackened jaw",
    "Bulging uneasy with a concrete grin",
    "And some inevitable need to weep.",
    "Don\u2019t you think we live and breathe",
    "In the meantime, in lockstep",
    "With dawn, sunset, brawling dawn?",
    "Even now, you await secrets worse",
    "Than the few known ways a seized sky",
    "Will come to survive your pity.",
    "But on another far field, celebrated",
    "For its arrivals and evictions, you learn",
    "To be beautiful, never leading",
    "A sensible life, playing ball in the early dark,",
    "Fighting for a taste of the sweet spot,",
    "In this uncut land, this straight-edged air.",
    "Whadya want to know that isn\u2019t yet a mystery",
    "Somewhere, a confidential stumble, heat",
    "Lightning, a first-rate backseat turndown?",
    "So it is that later you track high above",
    "Familiar tamarack and ash, beginning",
    "The next inaccuracy alone, and again,",
    "Remembering that everything east of you",
    "Has already happened, on the same cold ground,",
    "In a swarm of time, finally spiked home",
    "To your surprise, nails flung to the air.",
    "And us all thumbs to the hot hammer-licks",
    "You hear from the roadhouse before you see it."
