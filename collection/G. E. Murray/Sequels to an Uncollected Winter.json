    "This is the deathless body, and this",
    "the land\u2019s blood \u2026 and here the wine-laced sky",
    "over Iowa resembles a heavenly parfait.",
    "In one more day Des Moines",
    "will be diapered by first snow. A young girl,",
    "barely real, glazes the sidewalk",
    "with a stupid look. Iowa in winter always",
    "dumbfounds the love in us.",
    "Before long, nothing opposes the weight and resolution",
    "of this sky, this wilderness of earth",
    "hardening. When heaviness strikes like a clock",
    "glowing incandescently, the season",
    "opens to itself, as if a familiar stunt",
    "in a traveling show, a fabulation only",
    "a touched young girl can devise for any new world.",
    "Cooking the Cold",
    "In our smoke house,",
    "in hot fog of hickory and buckeye chips,",
    "we hang meats",
    "like vignettes, independent",
    "of all but the bones",
    "we crack",
    "and soup. Outside,",
    "it\u2019s the same white shimmering",
    "Ohio country",
    "we trust like an open palm,",
    "like an apothecary.",
    "And in these crosswinds,",
    "as our fire builds,",
    "stirrings of primordial dusk begin",
    "fogging in.",
    "Long Christmas evening in a farm woman\u2019s bed,",
    "I warm like a quilt.",
    "A December of junctions,",
    "dark, unlittered, airy as entry",
    "into fable, cutting against grains",
    "of propriety. We are decent",
    "enough, naked in the self-paintings",
    "we brush like hair. On holy night,",
    "waking to the screech of pipes bursting",
    "in winter\u2019s elaborate dwelling,",
    "our spines ice us",
    "upright, like posts in the sheets.",
    "Assured of disaster,",
    "we fall back to swarm over",
    "the gifts",
    "from our polished skins.",
    "The Certainties",
    "Kept animals stray in the wind-driven snow twenty miles northwest",
    "Out of Minneapolis, white-faced heifers each searching the eyes",
    "Of the others, doomed. These distances blowing closed over roads",
    "And county fences, emanate from the hardest parts of us like certainties.",
    "At desolate junctures, hardly moving, a gunshot of breath signals",
    "The residue of soul. On this barren, narrow towpath, the hung",
    "Bellies of cows lunge through drifts forming whale tracks, inching",
    "Ahead, the beasts hopeful as drifters at the hiring gate. Night-hammered,",
    "Blizzard-ripe, we wait by the window with house plants, our fears",
    "Nearly realized, a salt lick of faith turning to stone in our bowels.",
    "An Undoing",
    "My horses are dead,",
    "but the hail has gone.",
    "Three hundred miles south",
    "the ground is fit to plant.",
    "I rinse out in a wind,",
    "dreaming of lumber.",
    "Logs and dead crops",
    "appear in my songs.",
    "In this looseleaf country,",
    "I can bury and build.",
    "Rightly, it is winter.",
    "I won\u2019t need more horses.",
    "On the Upside",
    "On Hubbard Street, among factory signs",
    "And the gay bars further west, this winter",
    "In the ditch does not mean enough.",
    "With innocence, a melodrama of duty",
    "Is played by the big Pole city workers,",
    "Flinging rock salt, unplugging sewers",
    "In defense of a surprise freeze.",
    "Their smiles, like habits, break hard.",
    "Their black stocking caps appear",
    "Stark and vulnerable to the young men cruising",
    "Past hand-in-hand, swimming at noon",
    "Toward darkened theaters and bargain hotels,",
    "Requiring sweet ambush, a ration",
    "Of luxury. These filthy buildings don\u2019t care,",
    "Can\u2019t whistle insults. Soon the Poles,",
    "Immutable as mud, will have picked",
    "These streets clean of ice",
    "And loitering glances, will filter",
    "Home to dinners of wurst and bock beer,",
    "Laying odds against more snow.",
    "And slowly, in its timeliness, a clothesline",
    "Of color will string through the city,",
    "Flapping proudly, ready for collision",
    "With high blue skies, like old lovers",
    "Tossing again in a warehouse loft, straining free."
