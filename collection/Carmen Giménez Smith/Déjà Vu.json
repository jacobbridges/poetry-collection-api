    "It happened to me once.",
    "Winter came, and snow quilted every inch.",
    "I stood on the soapbox, as I was told,",
    "and made staggering accusations. The public ignored,",
    "so I retreated behind the potted yew.",
    "I was waiting for a moment I was supposed to have",
    "on a balcony overlooking the giant, gridded landscape.",
    "The sounds I made underscored what I meant.",
    "The potted yew was the face that I wore.",
    "It was a metaphor for what could be.",
    "The public endured.",
    "I put the potted yew behind me. I made staggering an art.",
    "That wasn\u2019t the truth though. Winter",
    "comes and negates all its covers. It doesn\u2019t matter where I stand.",
    "The balcony is a floor without walls.",
    "The yew is a hurt that shadows.",
    "The instance lives beneath us. Not just us, everybody.",
    "The shadow hurts us. I make sounds like",
    "the truth. Fate and theft are involved.",
    "I think I told you this before. The floor is a wall that obscures.",
    "The yew is quilt without color. Shadow is a fate you involved.",
    "The yew on a balcony negates. I told you this before.",
    "I was left undone. It\u2019s what I meant. Underneath everyone."
