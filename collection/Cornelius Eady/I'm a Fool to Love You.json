    "Some folks will tell you the blues is a woman,",
    "Some type of supernatural creature.",
    "My mother would tell you, if she could,",
    "About her life with my father,",
    "A strange and sometimes cruel gentleman.",
    "She would tell you about the choices",
    "A young black woman faces.",
    "Is falling in love with some man",
    "A deal with the devil",
    "In blue terms, the tongue we use",
    "When we don't want nuance",
    "To get in the way,",
    "When we need to talk straight.",
    "My mother chooses my father",
    "After choosing a man",
    "Who was, as we sing it,",
    "Of no account.",
    "This man made my father look good,",
    "That's how bad it was.",
    "He made my father seem like an island",
    "In the middle of a stormy sea,",
    "He made my father look like a rock.",
    "And is the blues the moment you realize",
    "You exist in a stacked deck,",
    "You look in a mirror at your young face,",
    "The face my sister carries,",
    "And you know it's the only leverage",
    "You've got.",
    "Does this create a hurt that whispers",
    "Is the blues the moment",
    "You shrug your shoulders",
    "And agree, a girl without money",
    "Is nothing, dust",
    "To be pushed around by any old breeze.",
    "Compared to this,",
    "My father seems, briefly,",
    "To be a fire escape.",
    "This is the way the blues works",
    "Its sorry wonders,",
    "Makes trouble look like",
    "A feather bed,",
    "Makes the wrong man's kisses",
    "A healing."
