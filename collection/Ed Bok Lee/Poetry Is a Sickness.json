    "of a uniquely lonely childhood",
    "If I had a dime for every happy poem I wrote",
    "I'd be dead",
    "Want to write about the war, oppression, injustice,",
    "and look here, see, what got left behind",
    "when all the sand and dust cleared",
    "is the puke-green carpet in the Harbor Lights Salvation Army treatment center",

    "The triolet that smiled to violate you",
    "through both ears",
    "But Poet, Sucker, Fool",
    "It's your job",
    "to find meaning in all this because",
    "you are delusional enough to believe",
    "that, yes, poetry is a sickness,",
    "but somehow if you can just scrape together enough beauty and truth",
    "to recall, yes, that Broadway car crash was fucked up,",
    "but the way the rain fell to wash away the blood",
    "not ten minutes after the ambulance left",
    "was gorgeous",

    "to forget",
    "maybe these scales",

    "to find each flaw that made us",
    "Exquisite"
