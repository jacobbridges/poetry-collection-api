    "With a handsome boy who wants to hold me all night.",
    "I can\u2019t lie that dreams are ridiculous.",
    "And in dreaming myself upon the moon",
    "I have made the moon my home and no one",

    "And as my bridegroom comes and takes me away from you",
    "You all ask me what is wrong and I say it is",
    "That I will never win."
