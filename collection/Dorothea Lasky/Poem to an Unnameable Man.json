    "You have changed me already. I am a fireball",
    "That is hurtling towards the sky to where you are",
    "You can choose not to look up but I am a giant orange ball",
    "That is throwing sparks upon your face",
    "Oh look at them shake",
    "Upon you like a great planet that has been murdered by change",
    "O too this is so dramatic this shaking",
    "Of my great planet that is bigger than you thought it would be",
    "So you ran and hid",
    "Under a large tree. She was graceful, I think",
    "That tree although soon she will wither",
    "Into ten black snakes upon your throat",
    "And when she does I will be wandering as I always am",
    "A graceful lady that is part museum",
    "Of the voices of the universe everyone else forgets",
    "I will hold your voice in a little box",
    "And when you come upon me I won\u2019t look back at you",
    "You will feel a hand upon your heart while I place your voice back",
    "Into the heart from where it came from",
    "And I will not cry also",
    "Although you will expect me to",
    "I was wiser too than you had expected",
    "For I knew all along you were mine"
