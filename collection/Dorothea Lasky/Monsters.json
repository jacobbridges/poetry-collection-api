    "This is a world where there are monsters",
    "There are monsters everywhere, racoons and skunks",
    "There are possums outside, there are monsters in my bed.",
    "There is one monster. He is my little one.",
    "I talk to my little monster.",
    "I give my little monster some bacon but that does not satisfy him.",
    "I tell him, ssh ssh, don\u2019t growl little monster!",
    "And he growls, oh boy does he growl!",
    "And he wants something from me,",
    "He wants my soul.",
    "And finally giving in, I give him my gleaming soul",
    "And as he eats my gleaming soul, I am one with him",
    "And stare out his eyepits and I see nothing but white",
    "And then I see nothing but fog and the white I had seen before was nothing but fog",
    "And there is nothing but fog out the eyes of monsters."
