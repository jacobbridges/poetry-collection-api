    "The birth isn\u2019t about poetry",
    "It is about screaming pain on a Sunday",
    "Hailing a cab and head racing",
    "To the hospital, now so close to the new apartment",
    "I had a baby inside of me",
    "But no one expected it to happen so fast",
    "Or then at least they said they didn\u2019t",
    "Maybe they expected it to happen so fast",
    "All along",
    "Alone in the waiting room I shook and shook",
    "And the blood ran down my legs",
    "Later with the magnesium",
    "I thought of the many permutations of the bald head",
    "Pale, pickling fish skin, glowing with scales",
    "When she came out, she was dark and full of hair",
    "No blood, but born in the caul",
    "Like the other magical realities of my past accomplishments",
    "When she came out she cried and it sounded like me",
    "But passed me, into her new reality",
    "Now 3 weeks later, they say I am still not an erotic object",
    "So I wander the park in the snow with my friend",
    "We light candles and pray to the darkness",
    "We light the park on fire and the police come and find us",
    "When they take us to the jail, I say no, it\u2019s not right",
    "I am a mother after all",
    "They say, but where is your baby",
    "And I say, no no, my baby my baby",
    "They say, yes yes, look at your beautiful baby",
    "I say, I do, I do",
    "Look, look, and listen",
    "My baby my baby",
    "She\u2019s here"
