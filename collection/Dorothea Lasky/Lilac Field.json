    "To perform death is something only humans would do",
    "No animal would sit there",
    "With a blank look on its face",
    "Just because the camera is there",
    "No no an animal would look directly in it",
    "Or cover its face, like the overweight",
    "Woman in the picture in the magazine",
    "By the room where I keep my bed",
    "What people don\u2019t understand about beauty",
    "Is that after all it is not fleeting",
    "After all it is so gross to be that way",
    "That someone sees among you",
    "After all, to call into question",
    "I painted my lips, my eyes",
    "Only our scholars know that",
    "To perform is to be malleable",
    "To perform in language",
    "Or was it",
    "The large purple insect I let in the room",
    "Or was it the furred face \u2014 the hippo or the gorge",
    "That I was the devil in the wood",
    "In my own bones that I knew the face",
    "That I took that face",
    "Was it midnight blue sky",
    "No, were my wings iridescent",
    "Even in these lines",
    "The voice moves you",
    "What sense of exquisite cause",
    "Thought",
    "Moves you past these lines",
    "Into conversation",
    "With the undead",
    "I don\u2019t know",
    "That is something",
    "You will have to answer for yourself",
    "I came back to this place to help you",
    "And that I did",
    "Shoot sparks of green and gray",
    "Through time",
    "What skin sack",
    "I put myself in",
    "I mean for what, why,",
    "Or who",
    "Did I manage to do this for if not you",
    "Lilaced thing",
    "The soft rustle of beetle wings",
    "In air that is warm and gray",
    "And is not strong",
    "But there, is there to carry us past it"
