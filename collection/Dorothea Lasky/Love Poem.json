    "The rain whistled.",
    "A taxi brought me to your apartment building",
    "And there I stood.",
    "I had dreamed a dream",
    "Of us in a bedroom.",
    "The light shining upon us in white sheets.",
    "You were singing me a song of your sailing days",
    "And in the dream",
    "I reached deep in you and pulled out a cardinal",
    "Which in bright red",
    "Flew out the window.",
    "Sometimes when we talk",
    "On the phone, I think to myself",
    "That the deep perfect of your soul",
    "Is what draws me to you.",
    "But still what soul is perfect?",
    "All souls are misshapen and off-colored.",
    "Morning comes within a soul",
    "And makes it obey another law",
    "In which all souls are snowflakes.",
    "Once at a funeral, a man had died",
    "And with the prayers said, his soul flew up in a hurry",
    "Like it had been let out of something awful.",
    "It was strangely colored, that soul.",
    "And it was a funny shape and a funny temperature.",
    "As it blew away, all of us looking felt the cold."
