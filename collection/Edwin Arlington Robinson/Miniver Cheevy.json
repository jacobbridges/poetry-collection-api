    "Miniver Cheevy, child of scorn,",
    "Grew lean while he assailed the seasons;",
    "He wept that he was ever born,",
    "And he had reasons.",
    "Miniver loved the days of old",
    "When swords were bright and steeds were prancing;",
    "The vision of a warrior bold",
    "Would set him dancing.",
    "Miniver sighed for what was not,",
    "And dreamed, and rested from his labors;",
    "He dreamed of Thebes and Camelot,",
    "And Priam\u2019s neighbors.",
    "Miniver mourned the ripe renown",
    "That made so many a name so fragrant;",
    "He mourned Romance, now on the town,",
    "And Art, a vagrant.",
    "Miniver loved the Medici,",
    "Albeit he had never seen one;",
    "He would have sinned incessantly",
    "Could he have been one.",
    "Miniver cursed the commonplace",
    "And eyed a khaki suit with loathing;",
    "He missed the medi\u00e6val grace",
    "Of iron clothing.",
    "Miniver scorned the gold he sought,",
    "But sore annoyed was he without it;",
    "Miniver thought, and thought, and thought,",
    "And thought about it.",
    "Miniver Cheevy, born too late,",
    "Scratched his head and kept on thinking;",
    "Miniver coughed, and called it fate,",
    "And kept on drinking."
