    "There is a drear and lonely tract of hell",
    "From all the common gloom removed afar:",
    "A flat, sad land it is, where shadows are,",
    "Whose lorn estate my verse may never tell.",
    "I walked among them and I knew them well:",
    "Men I had slandered on life's little star",
    "For churls and sluggards; and I knew the scar",
    "Upon their brows of woe ineffable.",
    "But as I went majestic on my way,",
    "Into the dark they vanished, one by one,",
    "Till, with a shaft of God's eternal day,",
    "The dream of all my glory was undone,\u0097",
    "And, with a fool's importunate dismay,",
    "I heard the dead men singing in the sun."
