    "It wasn't holy so let us not praise gods.",
    "Let us not look to them for bread,",
    "nor the cup that changed water to wine.",
    "Let us look to the bend of the road",
    "that reaches. A silver blur across",
    "the skyline, woman standing on the farm.",
    "In her grasp, the shine that is seed,",
    "that is beginning. She will work",
    "the earth, bounty in the vault",
    "of cosmos above her, heat",
    "lightning that lassoes in its manic",
    "current. Man never existed",
    "but to invite danger. Loveless one.",
    "There was once an army of men,",
    "saluting from bayonet to bomb.",
    "They were expert at sabotage, hand combat.",
    "You stop the clock in your paltry chest.",
    "The one that says",
    ".",
    "Wind that desired backward. Ring",
    "the alarm. When you wake, no more",
    "pain. A mirror like a window looking out.",
    "What can your past now say to you",
    "that has never been said before? What",
    "of that clock that forbade you to move",
    "forward. What of the clock that asked",
    "for nothing but passage, the minutes",
    "careening into you like a fitful arrow.",
    "What of the clock that summoned nothing,",
    "not even mercy. Once you tired of wanting,",
    "a face to break, you started the clock again."
