    "Last night I found my face below",
    "the water in my cupped hands.",
    "The mask made of copper and bone",
    "criss-crossing to make a smirk,",
    "a false glamour, a plated glaze.",
    "I unwound myself from the heavy",
    "machinery of my body's burden.",
    "The lute, the light, chime.",
    "I'll get up and partner myself",
    "with music, the purple moon",
    "peeling itself like a plum.",
    "Men stand in a circle and",
    "they will ask and ask again.",
    "I want to pick the thick bud,",
    "to lose myself in the body's posture",
    "bending in or away, to let",
    "my majesty and birthright go",
    "and gesture toward a waking life."
