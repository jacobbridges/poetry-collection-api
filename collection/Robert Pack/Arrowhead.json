    "Where two streams joined, we met",
    "By accident, sitting upon an outcropping of rock",
    "With only the intent of watching",
    "Water flow beneath unwinding water.",
    "Facing up-stream, she held a flower",
    "To the sun as I leaned back and found",
    "An arrowhead inside a crevice, which lay there",
    "As if someone had left it by intent",
    "As an excuse for me to speak above the whirl of water",
    "Swirling upon stone and thus",
    "Transform the accident of meeting her\u2014",
    "Ablaze in sunlight with a flower in her hand\u2014",
    "Into stark fact as obdurate as rock.",
    "Could I have called, \"Look at this arrowhead",
    "I just found here!\" Would she have thought",
    "\"An accident, that's credible,\"",
    "Or feared that my intent was sinister,",
    "And that the implication of the arrowhead,",
    "Unlike the radiant white flower or",
    "The two streams merging into faster water,",
    "Casting up colored spume,",
    "Had been contrived by me, certain as rock",
    "That forms by geologic laws?",
    "She had to know an arrowhead",
    "Is humanly designed with the intent to kill,",
    "Though now it's harmless as a flower",
    "Decorating someone's hair,",
    "Or water organized into a garden fountain.",
    "An arrowhead can now be used",
    "As an adornment for a necklace",
    "Like a flower in a painting where a stream",
    "Leaps past a light-reflecting rock",
    "With nothing in a brush-stroke left to accident.",
    "And so our accidental meeting on the rock",
    "Flowed by, a flower cast upon the water",
    "With intent unknown, and all",
    "That's left now is the arrowhead."
