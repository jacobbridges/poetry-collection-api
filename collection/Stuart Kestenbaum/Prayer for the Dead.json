    "The light snow started late last night and continued",
    "all night long while I slept and could hear it occasionally",
    "enter my sleep, where I dreamed my brother",
    "was alive again and possessing the beauty of youth, aware",
    "that he would be leaving again shortly and that is the lesson",
    "of the snow falling and of the seeds of death that are in everything",
    "that is born: we are here for a moment",
    "of a story that is longer than all of us and few of us",
    "remember, the wind is blowing out of someplace",
    "we don\u2019t know, and each moment contains rhythms",
    "within rhythms, and if you discover some old piece",
    "of your own writing, or an old photograph,",
    "you may not remember that it was you and even if it was once you,",
    "it\u2019s not you now, not this moment that the synapses fire",
    "and your hands move to cover your face in a gesture",
    "of grief and remembrance."
