    "I painted a phoenix in bright colors",
    "cut it in nine pieces and cooked it",
    "in a pot at the mountaintop.",
    "I stirred it as if cranking reels of",
    "a movie. Unraveled were a series",
    "of faces in mosaic.",
    "Kurosawa appeared. He asked me",
    "what my story was about.",
    "Tongue-tied, I could not answer.",
    "He handed me a token with a silvery",
    "eagle engraved, ready to fly.",
    "How real I thought everything was",
    "in my dream!",
    "In my waking hour, I see",
    "the remnant of the war between",
    "my head and heart.",
    "Now in cease-fire, my chest is filled",
    "with the fresh breeze of serenity.",
    "I begin to breathe gently as my story",
    "is unraveled like in a movie.",
    "No longer haunted, my love of God soars",
    "as I see my guardian angel smile",
    "in the clear blue sky, transforming to",
    "one gigantic phoenix.",
    "My wandering in the wilderness of",
    "the mind has taught me a little wisdom.",
    "I believe my dreams are real",
    "as my life is a dream."
