    "I watched the nesting redstart",
    "when we camped by Lake Winnepesaukee.",
    "The tent pegs pulled out in soft soil.",
    "Rain made pawprints on the canvas.",
    "So much clings to the shoes,",
    "the old shoes must be discarded,",
    "but we're fools to think that does it:",
    "burning the scraps.",
    "I listened for the rain at Mt. Monadnock,",
    "for the barred owl on a tent peak",
    "among scrub pines in Michigan.",
    "I can hear my father stir",
    "and the cot creak. The flap opens.",
    "He goes out and never returns",
    "though the coffee steams on the grill",
    "and the redstart sings in the alders."
