    "The day is dark and the night",
    "To him that would search their heart;",
    "No lips of cloud that will part",
    "Nor morning song in the light:",
    "Only, gazing alone,",
    "To him wild shadows are shown,",
    "Deep under deep unknown",
    "And height above unknown height.",

    "Nam'd new, we name it the old;",
    "Thereof some tale hath been told,",
    "But no word comes from the dead;",

    "Or whether as bond or free,",
    "Or whether they too were we,",

    "What of the heart of hate",
    "That beats in thy breast, O Time?i",
    "Red strife from the furthest prime,",
    "And anguish of fierce debate;",
    "War that shatters her slain,",
    "And peace that grinds them as grain,",
    "And eyes fix'd ever in vain",
    "On the pitiless eyes of Fate.",
    "Still we say as we go,i",
    "\"Strange to think by the way,",
    "Whatever there is to know,",
    "That shall we know one day.\"",
    "What of the heart of love",
    "That bleeds in thy breast, O Man?i",
    "Thy kisses snatch'd 'neath the ban",
    "Of fangs that mock them above;",
    "Thy bells prolong'd unto knells,",
    "Thy hope that a breath dispels,",
    "Thy bitter forlorn farewells",
    "And the empty echoes thereof?",

    "The sky leans dumb on the sea,",
    "Aweary with all its wings;",

    "Our present is and is not,",
