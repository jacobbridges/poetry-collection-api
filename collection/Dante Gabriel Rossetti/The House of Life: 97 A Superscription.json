    "Look in my face; my name is Might-have-been;",
    "I am also call'd No-more, Too-late, Farewell;",
    "Unto thine ear I hold the dead-sea shell",
    "Cast up thy Life's foam-fretted feet between;",
    "Unto thine eyes the glass where that is seen",
    "Which had Life's form and Love's, but by my spell",
    "Is now a shaken shadow intolerable,",
    "Of ultimate things unutter'd the frail screen.",
    "Mark me, how still I am! But should there dart",
    "One moment through thy soul the soft surprise",
    "Of that wing'd Peace which lulls the breath of sighs,\u0097",
    "Then shalt thou see me smile, and turn apart",
    "Thy visage to mine ambush at thy heart",
    "Sleepless with cold commemorative eyes."
