    "The two boys lean out on the railing",
    "of the front porch, looking up.",
    "Behind them they can hear their mother",
    "in one room watching \u201cName That Tune,\u201d",
    "their father in another watching",
    "a Walter Cronkite Special, the TVs",
    "turned up high and higher till they",
    "each can\u2019t hear the other\u2019s show.",
    "The older boy is saying that no matter",
    "how many stars you counted there were",
    "always more stars beyond them",
    "and beyond the stars black space",
    "going on forever in all directions,",
    "so that even if you flew up",
    "millions and millions of years",
    "you\u2019d be no closer to the end",
    "of it than they were now",
    "here on the porch on Tuesday night",
    "in the middle of summer.",
    "The younger boy can think somehow",
    "only of his mother\u2019s closet,",
    "how he likes to crawl in back",
    "behind the heavy drapery",
    "of shirts, nightgowns and dresses,",
    "into the sheer black where",
    "no matter how close he holds",
    "his hand up to his face",
    "there\u2019s no hand ever, no",
    "face to hold it to.",
    "A woman from another street",
    "is calling to her stray cat or dog,",
    "clapping and whistling it in,",
    "and farther away deep in the city",
    "sirens now and again",
    "veer in and out of hearing.",
    "The boys edge closer, shoulder",
    "to shoulder now, sad Ptolemies,",
    "the older looking up, the younger",
    "as he thinks back straight ahead",
    "into the black leaves of the maple",
    "where the street lights flicker",
    "like another watery skein of stars.",
    "\u201cName That Tune\u201d and Walter Cronkite",
    "struggle like rough water",
    "to rise above each other.",
    "And the woman now comes walking",
    "in a nightgown down the middle",
    "of the street, clapping and",
    "whistling, while the older boy",
    "goes on about what light years",
    "are, and solar winds, black holes,",
    "and how the sun is cooling",
    "and what will happen to",
    "them all when it is cold."
