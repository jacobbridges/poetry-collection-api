    "I lay back on the carpeted bottom step",
    "Of the stairwell that like a well extended",
    "Darkly up to the window near the ceiling,",
    "Up where the Chinaman under the wide-brimmed hat",
    "That hid his face pulled the flowerpot that held",
    "No flower across the sill no one could reach.",
    "There was a television on somewhere",
    "Above me, and the doomsday clock was ticking,",
    "Someone was saying. Someone was saying something",
    "About a blockade and a quarantine,",
    "Who would blink first, lose face, or push the button.",
    "A fat man banged a shoe against a desk.",
    "The Chinaman however didn\u2019t care.",
    "Pulling his flowerpot of absent flowers,",
    "He was content to be a clot of darkness",
    "Brightening the moment late sun caught the glass\u2014",
    "The hat tip first, and then the hat, the arms,",
    "The rickshaw of the flowerpot he pulled.",
    "And everywhere within the light\u2019s slow fall",
    "Infinities of particles were falling",
    "Into the flowerpot they\u2019d never fill."
