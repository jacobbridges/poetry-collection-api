    "Trailing her father, bearing his hand axe,",
    "the girl thought she had never",
    "guessed what earthly majesty",
    "was before",
    "then, as he strode unconcernedly",
    "holding a vicious gander",
    "by the horny mitts and let",
    "the big wings",
    "batter his knees. She was also surprised",
    "to feel a liberating",
    "satisfaction in the coming",
    "bloodshed, and",
    "that notwithstanding all the times she had",
    "been beleaguered and",
    "had fled, today she did not fear",
    "the barnyard hubub.",
    "Yet, as her father\u2019s clever stroke fell, as",
    "the pronged head skipped sideways",
    "and the neck plumes stiffened with blood",
    "from the cleft,",
    "she was angry; and, when the headless goose",
    "ran to the brook and was",
    "carried off into the woods alive,",
    "she rejoiced,",
    "and subsequently frequented those woods",
    "and avoided her father.",
    "When the goose began to mend she",
    "brought him small",
    "hominy, which was welcome though she had",
    "to press the kernels one",
    "by one into the pink neck that",
    "throbbed into",
    "her palm; when haemorrhage occurred she would",
    "not spare handkerchiefs,",
    "and stanching the spot she felt a thrill",
    "of sympathy.",
    "But for the most part there was steady progress,",
    "and growing vigor was",
    "accompanied by restlessness,",
    "and one cool day",
    "the blind thing was batted out of existence",
    "by a motorcycle.",
    "She had no time for tears. She ran",
    "upstairs to miss",
    "her father\u2019s barytone commiseration,",
    "then out onto the fields,",
    "and, holding an old red pinwheel,",
    "ran ran ran ran."
