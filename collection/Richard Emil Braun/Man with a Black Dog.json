    "The first commotion stirred him to offend,",
    "forgivably, with friendly leaps and clutching;",
    "but soon too urgent friendliness was wrought",
    "by a new wave of guests. At last I complained",
    "to that one man that it was indecent",
    "of him to tempt the beast so, pressing his",
    "tweed knee against the furry brisket. But",
    "he smiled, and spoke with a Rhinelandish accent:",
    "Milady, your youth, as mine did me, tends",
    "you now to the younger beliefs of men,",
    "their naive symbols: cloudy animal heads",
    "to represent witless rampages of glands.",
    "Egyptian Hershef, Seth, Ra\u2014the romance",
    "of anonymity above the neck",
    "and smooth humanity below\u2014were gods",
    "of early hankering and youthful conscience.",
    "See how the shaggy thing turns back his ears;",
    "the straining mouth and eyes\u2019 protuberance",
    "leave me my steady vision and clear speech",
    "and mind. The aegipans, surely the centaurs",
    "are truer concepts of the dual beast",
    "and a maturer Hellas sculpted them:",
    "potentially ironic man above",
    "and hairy vitality below the waist.",
    "No one, Milady, no lover on earth",
    "does other than what I am doing now,",
    "methodically tempting the brute, till from",
    "the dim sheath an eager lick of flame darts forth."
