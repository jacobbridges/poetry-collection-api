    "This winter you lost",
    "one of your long low branches",
    "to a backed-up car",
    "and the old woman",
    "who has known you all her life",

    "Your bark is wrinkled",
    "more deeply than any face",

    "of paper moth wings",
    "do we seem rootless",
    "holding fast to the anchor",
    "of the saddest things"
