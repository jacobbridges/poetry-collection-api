    "They are threatening to leave us the nimble-throated singers",
    "the little murderers with the quick pulses",
    "They perch at the ends of bare branches their tails",
    "are ragged and pitiful the long green",
    "feathers are fallen out They go on eating and eating",
    "last autumn's yellow melia berries",
    "They do not care that you approach cold corpses",
    "rot in the grass in the reeds",
    "The gray-shouldered crows hobble about the wren",
    "barely a mouthful cocks her pert tail",
    "and threatens to slaughter the white-footed cat in the bushes",
    "They do not understand that they are dying",
    "They are threatening to leave us how quickly we forget",
    "the way they taught us how to play our voices",
    "opening soul to weightlessness like the Spartan poet",
    "singing under the burden of his old bones",
    "to the chorus girls with their honey songs and their holy voices",
    "how he wished he could scoot like a kingfisher",
    "lightly over the flower of the waves who boasted",
    "Where will we find songs when the sleek-headed",
    "mallards are gone who chase each other around the pond",
    "the reluctant duck and the lovesick drake",
    "The way she turns her head to the side to scold him",
    "the way her boyfriend",
    "chases off his rival and then swims back",
    "with feeble reassurances the way",
    "he sits on top of her the way she flaps her wings",
    "to keep above water the way they look",
    "pleased with themselves wagging their tails smoothing",
    "each feather back in its right place",
    "They are threatening to leave but you may still catch them",
    "saying goodbye stealthed in the cedar and cypress",
    "at dawn in the dark clarity between sleep and waking",
    "A run of five notes on a black flute",
    "another and another buried deep in the mix",
    "how many melodies can the air hold",
    "And what they sing so lovely and so meaningless",
    "may urge itself upon you with the ache",
    "of something just beyond the point of being remembered",
    "the trace of a brave thought in the face of sadness"
