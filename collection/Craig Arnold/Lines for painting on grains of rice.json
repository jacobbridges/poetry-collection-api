    "You are the kind of person who buys exotic fruits",
    "leaves them out on the counter until they rot",
    "You always mean to eat them sometimes you rearrange them",
    "rousing over the bowl a cloud of tiny flies",
    "sideways holding it up in his right foot",
    "How do they balance the parrot who chews a walnut",
    "the owl perched on a just-lit lamppost",
    "scratching behind its ear like a big dog",
    "Your pencil eraser wears down long before the point",
    "for every word you write you rub out two",
    "Where the slice of toast rested the plate is still warm",
    "a film of fog little points of dew",
    "Love is like velocity we feel the speeding up",
    "and the slowing down otherwise not at all",
    "the more steady the more it feels like going nowhere",
    "my love I want to go nowhere with you",
    "I cannot bring myself to toss the cup of cold coffee",
    "you set down by the door on your way to the taxi",
    "all day I have sipped it each time forgetting",
    "your two tablets of fake sugar too sweet",
    "Running down the street",
    "dodging between raindrops plump as cherries",
    "The ground was feathered with wild strawberries",
    "I picked seven as many as I could bear",
    "I ate two I saved the rest for you here",
    "hold out your hand take them taste how sweet",
    "the wall pleads",
    "spray-paint face and voice of a damned poet",
    "the darling damned poets save them from themselves",
    "maybe it is us they need saving from"
