    "The bird who creaks like a rusty playground swing",
    "the bird who sharpens the knife the bird who blows",
    "on the mouths of milk bottles the bird who bawls like a cat",
    "like a cartoon baby the bird who rubs the wineglass",
    "the bird who curlicues the bird who quacks like a duck",
    "but is not a duck the bird who pinks on a jeweller's hammer",
    "They hide behind the sunlight scattered throughout the canopy",
    "At the thud of your feet they fall thoughtful and quiet",
    "coming to life again only when you have passed",
    "Perhaps they are not multiple but one",
    "a many-mooded trickster whose voice is rich",
    "and infinitely various whose feathers",
    "liquify the rainbow rippling scarlet",
    "emerald indigo whose streaming tail",
    "is rare as a comet's a single glimpse of which",
    "is all that you could wish for the one thing",
    "missing to make your eyes at last feel full",
    "to meet this wild need of yours for wonder"
