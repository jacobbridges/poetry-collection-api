    "Lordship is the same activity",
    "Whether performed by lord or lady.",
    "Or a lord who happens to be a lady,",
    "All the source and all the faults.",
    "A woman steadfast in looking is a callot,",
    "And any woman in the wrong place",
    "Or outside of her proper location",
    "Is, by definition, a foolish woman.",
    "The harlot is talkative and wandering",
    "By the way, not bearing to be quiet,",
    "Not able to abide still at home,",
    "Now abroad, now in the streets,",
    "Now lying in wait near the corners,",
    "Her hair straying out of its wimple.",
    "The collar of her shift and robe",
    "Pressed one upon the other.",
    "She goes to the green to see to her geese,",
    "And trips to wrestling matches and taverns.",
    "The said Margery left her home",
    "In the parish of Bishopshill,",
    "And went to a house, the which",
    "The witness does not remember,",
    "And stayed there from noon",
    "Of that day until the darkness of night.",
    "But a whip made of raw hippopotamus",
    "Hide, trimmed like a corkscrew,",
    "And anon the creature was stabled",
    "In her wits as well as ever she was biforn,",
    "And prayed her husband as so soon",
    "As he came to her that she might have",
    "The keys to her buttery",
    "To take her meat and drink.",
    "He should never have my good will",
    "For to make my sister for to sell",
    "Candle and mustard in Framlyngham,",
    "Or fill her shopping list with crossbows,",
    "Almonds, sugar and cloth.",
    "The captainess, the vowess,",
    "Must use herself to work readily",
    "As other gentilwomen doon,",
    "In the innermost part of her house,",
    "In a great chamber far from the road.",
    "So love your windows as little as you can,",
    "For we be, either of us, weary of other."
