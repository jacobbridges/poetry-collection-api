    "Reckless and white as a flashlight beam cast",
    "into some dark corner, the moon",
    "insists on the deeper blackness",
    "surrounding it. Perhaps it wishes",
    "to be a woman or a window,",
    "cushioning everything, full of itself",
    "for the moment, yet frightened, like any egotist.",
    "But still the stars patiently insist",
    "on their presence, pinholes to nothingness.",
    "When else would I walk on such a night in the world?",
    "Half answers suggest themselves.",
    "The body consumes and wanes, collapses.",
    "We get to watch how everyone",
    "dies who dies before us,",
    "how birds rest.",
    "And yet while night solidifies,",
    "we can continue our discussion",
    "in our effort to open the gift of the world,",
    "our hope to find years",
    "in this box we tear apart.",
    "Birds do not count in our calibration.",
    "They crack time randomly, as if it were seeds.",
    "With sudden unaccountability",
    "they start up and disappear.",
    "And yet, in some way all of this",
    "is beside the point, for what can we do",
    "except continue our conversation,",
    "and what would we gain if we disappeared?",
    "They tell us that this is so.",
    "Do you have any songs from your childhood",
    "you still use to sing yourself to sleep?",
    "Being, mind, ego: the moon loves itself",
    "in cloud shimmers, dancing as if it had pulled",
    "a scant nightie off a laundry line",
    "to clown with.",
    "We can only walk while there is light."
