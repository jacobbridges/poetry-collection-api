    "He accuses you of asking all",
    "the wrong questions over and over.",
    "You attempt revolt to prove his medicine",
    "wheel is cracked and filling up its own pit.",
    "He hollers your face is unmasked and madness",
    "has found a home. All stink and rotten fur,",
    "he says to you, claims you had a choice",
    "and forgot what it was. Now he says",
    "your pain must run for the river,",
    "the river for the wind.",
    "He chuckles and the dark chatters, turning",
    "you around until your shadow is the earth\u2019s."
