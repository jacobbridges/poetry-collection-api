    "Alone in the library room, even when others",
    "Are there in the room, alone, except for themselves:",
    "There is the illusion of peace; the air in the room",
    "Is stilled; there are reading lights on the tables,",
    "Looking as if they're reading, looking as if",
    "They're studying the text, and understanding,",
    "Shedding light on what the words are saying;",
    "But under their steady imbecile gaze the page",
    "Is blank, patiently waiting not to be blank.",
    "The page is blank until the mind that reads",
    "Crosses the black river, seeking the Queen",
    "Of the Underworld, Persephone, where she sits",
    "By the side of the one who brought her there from Enna,",
    "Hades the mute, the deaf, king of the dead letter;",
    "She is clothed in the beautiful garment of our thousand",
    "Misunderstandings of the sacred text."
