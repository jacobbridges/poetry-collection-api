    "Stripped to the waist,",
    "hard-muscled, downcast, under the guns",
    "of lounging guards, they are clearing a roadside",
    "across a palmetto landscape.",
    "I notice one blond boy swinging a pick,",
    "broad-shouldered. His skin is smooth, bright, sweaty.",
    "His upright body ripples",
    "under the rigid fury of his face.",
    "His bulging eyes fixed on the ground",
    "can see mountains, the destiny",
    "of his imagination he can never get to,",
    "where he could rest, a lion",
    "in the wilderness of his flesh.",
    "I see the body with its own career of gestures\u2014",
    "its bright roads, its dark roads",
    "apart, serene. . .",
    "Men must be carved, apparently,",
    "like slaughtered steers or pigs",
    "to find the marble of their bones",
    "innocent,",
    "innocent after all",
    "as the stones they break, or rain,",
    "or the guards in cages of their white voices.",
    "Trapped in one chained line,",
    "one terrifying combination of arrangements,",
    "driven to taste each other's flesh. . .",
    "The body sings alone",
    "among the earth's arrangements",
    "ignorant of crimes or dreams",
    "or the curious idea of justice."
