    "Today I planted the sand cherry with red leaves\u2014",
    "and hope that I can go on digging in this yard,",
    "pruning the grape vine, twisting the silver lace",
    "on its trellis, the one that bloomed",
    "just before the frost flowered over all the garden.",
    "Next spring I will plant more zinnias, marigolds,",
    "straw flowers, pearly everlasting, and bleeding heart.",
    "I plant that for you, old love, old friend,",
    "and lilacs for remembering. The lily-of-the-valley",
    "with cream-colored bells, bent over slightly, bowing",
    "to the inevitable, flowers for a few days, a week.",
    "Now its broad blade leaves are streaked with brown",
    "and the stem dried to a pale hair.",
    "In place of the silent bells, red berries",
    "like rose hips blaze close to the ground.",
    "It is important for me to be down on my knees,",
    "my fingers sifting the black earth,",
    "making those things grow which will grow.",
    "Sometimes I save a weed if its leaves",
    "are spread fern-like, hand-like,",
    "or if it grows with a certain impertinence.",
    "I let the goldenrod stay and the wild asters.",
    "I save the violets in spring. People who kill violets",
    "will do anything."
