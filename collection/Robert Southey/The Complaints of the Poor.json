    "And wherefore do the Poor complain?",
    "The rich man asked of me,\u2014",
    "Come walk abroad with me, I said",
    "And I will answer thee.",
    "Twas evening and the frozen streets",
    "Were cheerless to behold,",
    "And we were wrapt and coated well,",
    "And yet we were a-cold.",
    "We met an old bare-headed man,",
    "His locks were few and white,",
    "I ask'd him what he did abroad",
    "In that cold winter's night:",
    "'Twas bitter keen indeed, he said,",
    "But at home no fire had he,",
    "And therefore, he had come abroad",
    "To ask for charity.",
    "We met a young bare-footed child,",
    "And she begg'd loud and bold,",
    "I ask'd her what she did abroad",
    "When the wind it blew so cold;",
    "She said her father was at home",
    "And he lay sick a-bed,",
    "And therefore was it she was sent",
    "Abroad to beg for bread.",
    "We saw a woman sitting down",
    "Upon a stone to rest,",
    "She had a baby at her back",
    "And another at her breast;",
    "I ask'd her why she loiter'd there",
    "When the wind it was so chill;",
    "She turn'd her head and bade the child",
    "That scream'd behind be still.",
    "She told us that her husband served",
    "A soldier, far away,",
    "And therefore to her parish she",
    "Was begging back her way.",
    "We met a girl; her dress was loose",
    "And sunken was her eye,",
    "Who with the wanton's hollow voice",
    "Address'd the passers by;",
    "I ask'd her what there was in guilt",
    "That could her heart allure",
    "To shame, disease, and late remorse?",
    "She answer'd, she was poor.",
    "I turn'd me to the rich man then",
    "For silently stood he,",
    "You ask'd me why the Poor complain,",
    "And these have answer'd thee."
