    "4TH CENTURY B.C.",
    "How beautiful, my wellbeloved, is your body of granite\u2014",
    "It smites my eyes like an army with banners.",
    "Your lips are the red wine poured from goatskin bags,",
    "Your brows are warriors' full-drawn bows,",
    "Your glances the arrows they shoot therefrom,",
    "And your hair is the mane of a lion, tawny and thick.",
    "17TH CENTURY",
    "Let us not love tonight past mind",
    "But stifle our intent",
    "Lest blazing passion, unconfined,",
    "Provoke imperilment.",
    "Against the dark, our fierce desire",
    "Would flare too bright for sight,",
    "So must we tame our blinding fire",
    "And bank it for the night.",
    "With luminating dawn's return",
    "And appetite's increase",
    "Our lusty flame can safely burn",
    "In furious release.",
    "18TH CENTURY",
    "Since even modest airs and prudish dress",
    "May not deter rash beaux from wantonness,",
    "Can your unsullied innocence o'ervault",
    "Concupiscent intention to assault?",
    "My sweet, have no misgivings, for you wear",
    "So plainly insurmountable an air",
    "That ogling lechers, hunting am'rous game,",
    "Will blush, apologize, and flee in shame.",
    "19TH CENTURY",
    "Ethereal nightingale, gallantly singing",
    "Your heart out in rich melodies",
    "To insentient stones, earless trees,",
    "And indifferent insects, forsake them! Go winging",
    "To town like a dart to the mark, I implore you,",
    "And, serving as courier bird,",
    "Tell her who is waiting this word:",
    "\"I'm locked in my room and can't come but adore you.\""
