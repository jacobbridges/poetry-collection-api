    "See! There he stands; not brave, but with an air",
    "Of sullen stupor. Mark him well! Is he",
    "Not more like brute than man? Look in his eye!",
    "No light is there; none, save the glint that shines",
    "In the now glaring, and now shifting orbs",
    "Of some wild animal caught in the hunter\u2019s trap.",
    "How came this beast in human shape and form?",
    "Speak man!\u2014We call you man because you wear",
    "His shape\u2014How are you thus? Are you not from",
    "That docile, child-like, tender-hearted race",
    "Which we have known three centuries? Not from",
    "That more than faithful race which through three wars",
    "Fed our dear wives and nursed our helpless babes",
    "Without a single breach of trust? Speak out!",
    "I am, and am not.",
    "Then who, why are you?",
    "I am a thing not new, I am as old",
    "As human nature. I am that which lurks,",
    "Ready to spring whenever a bar is loosed;",
    "The ancient trait which fights incessantly",
    "Against restraint, balks at the upward climb;",
    "The weight forever seeking to obey",
    "The law of downward pull\u2014and I am more:",
    "The bitter fruit am I of planted seed;",
    "The resultant, the inevitable end",
    "Of evil forces and the powers of wrong.",
    "Lessons in degradation, taught and learned,",
    "The memories of cruel sights and deeds,",
    "The pent-up bitterness, the unspent hate",
    "Filtered through fifteen generations have",
    "Sprung up and found in me sporadic life.",
    "In me the muttered curse of dying men,",
    "On me the stain of conquered women, and",
    "Consuming me the fearful fires of lust,",
    "Lit long ago, by other hands than mine.",
    "In me the down-crushed spirit, the hurled-back prayers",
    "Of wretches now long dead\u2014their dire bequests.",
    "In me the echo of the stifled cry",
    "Of children for their battered mothers\u2019 breasts.",
    "I claim no race, no race claims me; I am",
    "No more than human dregs; degenerate;",
    "The monstrous offspring of the monster, Sin;",
    "I am\u2014just what I am. . . . The race that fed",
    "Your wives and nursed your babes would do the same",
    "Today. But I\u2014",
    "Enough, the brute must die!",
    "Quick! Chain him to that oak! It will resist",
    "The fire much longer than this slender pine.",
    "Now bring the fuel! Pile it round him! Wait!",
    "Pile not so fast or high! or we shall lose",
    "The agony and terror in his face.",
    "And now the torch! Good fuel that! the flames",
    "Already leap head-high. Ha! hear that shriek!",
    "And there\u2019s another! wilder than the first.",
    "Fetch water! Water! Pour a little on",
    "The fire, lest it should burn too fast. Hold so!",
    "Now let it slowly blaze again. See there!",
    "He squirms! He groans! His eyes bulge wildly out,",
    "Searching around in vain appeal for help!",
    "Another shriek, the last! Watch how the flesh",
    "Grows crisp and hangs till, turned to ash, it sifts",
    "Down through the coils of chain that hold erect",
    "The ghastly frame against the bark-scorched tree.",
    "Stop! to each man no more than one man\u2019s share.",
    "You take that bone, and you this tooth; the chain,",
    "Let us divide its links; this skull, of course,",
    "In fair division, to the leader comes.",
    "And now his fiendish crime has been avenged;",
    "Let us back to our wives and children\u2014say,",
    "What did he mean by those last muttered words,",
    "?"
