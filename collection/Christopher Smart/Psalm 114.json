    "When Israel came from Egypt\u2019s coast,",
    "And Goshen\u2019s marshy plains,",
    "And Jacob with his joyful host",
    "From servitude and chains;",
    "Then was it seen how much the Jews",
    "Were holy in his sight,",
    "And God did Israel\u2019s kingdom choose",
    "To manifest his might.",
    "The sea beheld it, and with dread",
    "Retreated to make way;",
    "And Jordan to his fountain head",
    "Ran backwards in dismay.",
    "The mountains, like the rams that bound,",
    "Exulted on their base;",
    "Like lambs the little hills around",
    "Skipt lightly from their place.",
    "What is the cause, thou mighty sea,",
    "That thou thyself should shun;",
    "And Jordan, what is come to thee,",
    "That thou should backward run?",
    "Ye mountains that ye leaped so high",
    "From off the solid rock,",
    "Ye hills that ye should gambols try,",
    "Like firstlings of the flock?",
    "Earth, from the center to the sod",
    "His fearful presence hail",
    "The presence of Jeshurun\u2019s God,",
    "In whom our arms prevail.",
    "Who beds of rocks in pools to stand",
    "Can by his word compel,",
    "And from the veiny flint command",
    "The fountain and the well."
