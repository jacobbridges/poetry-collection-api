    "I hope you'll pardon the informality",
    "of this letter, postmarked Olympia",
    "(Greece, not Washington), its task not simple:",
    "crossing lines you've crossed, time, mortality,",
    "to find you, who spent a lifetime crossing lines",
    "out, twisting, polishing them to shine",
    "cool and lustrous as the statue I fell in",
    "love with yesterday. I'm sure you saw him",
    "too, that perfect Hermes by Praxitelis,",
    "full lips, hips",
    ". I wished to draw him",
    "down, latter-day Pygmalion, and embrace",
    "him. Or barring Eros (and the guards) I'd trace",
    "his face, the supple muscle of the marble.",
    "I had a student who resembled him\u2014",
    "yes, Angelos\u2014arrogant and beautiful.",
    "I never touched him though he touches me in dreams.",
    "Eros dangles his perfection in our faces",
    "like one-armed Hermes with his promise of the grapes.",
    "I was certain I'd dream of him last night.",
    "Instead I dreamed another in the growing chain",
    "of others with whom it ended not quite",
    "right. But the thirst was perfect, if its price pain",
    "and shattered crystal, spilling wine, all part",
    "and parcel of our imperfect lives. Then Art",
    "startles out of heartache, marble or page.",
    "You learned this long ago. Now I too see",
    "the wildest things require the strongest cages,",
    "the panther's double bars, or the seeds,",
    "bloodysweet and bitter, in the pomegranate's",
    "rind. Love held tight in a sonnet."
