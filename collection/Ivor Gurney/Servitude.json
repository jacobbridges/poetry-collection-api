    "If it were not for England, who would bear",
    "This heavy servitude one moment more?",
    "To keep a brothel, sweep and wash the floor",
    "Of filthiest hovels were noble to compare",
    "With this brass-cleaning life. Now here, now there",
    "Harried in foolishness, scanned curiously o'er",
    "By fools made brazen by conceit, and store",
    "Of antique witticisms thin and bare.",
    "Only the love of comrades sweetens all,",
    "Whose laughing spirit will not be outdone.",
    "As night-watching men wait for the sun",
    "To hearten them, so wait I on such boys",
    "As neither brass nor Hell-fire may appal,",
    "Nor guns, nor sergeant-major's bluster and noise."
