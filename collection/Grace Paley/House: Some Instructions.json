    "If you have a house",
    "you must think about it all the time",
    "as you reside in the house so",
    "it must be a home in your mind",
    "you must ask yourself (wherever you are)",
    "have I closed the front door",
    "and the back door is often forgotten",
    "not against thieves necessarily",
    "but the wind oh if it blows",
    "either door open then the heat",
    "the heat you\u2019ve carefully nurtured",
    "with layers of dry hardwood",
    "and a couple of opposing green",
    "brought in to slow the fire",
    "as well as the little pilot light",
    "in the convenient gas backup",
    "all of that care will be mocked because",
    "you have not kept the house on your mind",
    "but these may actually be among",
    "the smallest concerns for instance",
    "the house could be settling you may",
    "notice the thin slanting line of light",
    "above the doors you have to think about that",
    "luckily you have been paying attention",
    "the house\u2019s dryness can be humidified",
    "with vaporizers in each room and pots",
    "of water on the woodstove should you leave",
    "for the movies after dinner ask yourself",
    "have I turned down the thermometer",
    "and moved all wood paper away from the stove",
    "the fiery result of excited distraction",
    "could be too horrible to describe",
    "now we should talk especially to Northerners",
    "of the freezing of the pipe this can often",
    "be prevented by pumping water continuously",
    "through the baseboard heating system",
    "allowing the faucet to drip drip continuously",
    "day and night you must think about the drains",
    "separately in fact you should have established",
    "their essential contribution to the ordinary",
    "kitchen and toilet life of the house",
    "digging these drains deep into warm earth",
    "if it hasn\u2019t snowed by mid-December you",
    "must cover them with hay sometimes rugs",
    "and blankets have been used do not be",
    "troubled by their monetary value",
    "as this is a regionally appreciated emergency",
    "you may tell your friends to consider",
    "your house as their own that is",
    "if they do not wear outdoor shoes",
    "when thumping across the gleam of their poly-",
    "urethaned floors they must bring socks or slippers",
    "to your house as well you must think",
    "of your house when you\u2019re in it and",
    "when you\u2019re visiting the superior cabinets",
    "and closets of others when you approach",
    "your house in the late afternoon",
    "in any weather green or white you will catch",
    "sight first of its new aluminum snow-resistant",
    "roof and the reflections in the cracked windows",
    "its need in the last twenty-five years for paint",
    "which has created a lovely design",
    "in russet pink and brown the colors of un-",
    "intentioned neglect you must admire the way it does",
    "(because of someone\u2019s excellent decision",
    "sixty years ago) stand on the high ridge deforming",
    "the green profile of the hill but rests in the modesty",
    "of late middle age under the brow of the hill with",
    "its back to the dark hemlock forest looking steadily",
    "out for miles toward the cloud refiguring meadows and",
    "mountains of the next state coming up the road",
    "by foot or auto the house can be addressed personally",
    "House! in the excitement of work and travel to",
    "other people\u2019s houses with their interesting improvements",
    "we thought of you often and spoke of your coziness",
    "in winter your courage in wind and fire your small",
    "airy rooms in humid summer how you nestle in spring",
    "into the leaves and flowers of the hawthorn and the sage green",
    "leaves of the Russian olive tree House! you were not forgotten"
