    "I went out walking",
    "in the old neighborhood",
    "Look! more trees on the block",
    "forget-me-nots all around them",
    "ivy lantana shining",
    "and geraniums in the window",
    "Twenty years ago",
    "it was believed that the roots of trees",
    "would insert themselves into gas lines",
    "then fall poisoned on houses and children",
    "or tap the city\u2019s water pipes starved",
    "for nitrogen obstruct the sewers",
    "In those days in the afternoon I floated",
    "by ferry to Hoboken or Staten Island",
    "then pushed the babies in their carriages",
    "along the river wall observing Manhattan",
    "See Manhattan I cried New York!",
    "even at sunset it doesn\u2019t shine",
    "but stands in fire charcoal to the waist",
    "But this Sunday afternoon on Mother\u2019s Day",
    "I walked west and came to Hudson Street tricolored flags",
    "were flying over old oak furniture for sale",
    "brass bedsteads copper pots and vases",
    "by the pound from India",
    "Suddenly before my eyes twenty-two transvestites",
    "in joyous parade stuffed pillows under",
    "their lovely gowns",
    "and entered a restaurant",
    "under a sign which said All Pregnant Mothers Free",
    "I watched them place napkins over their bellies",
    "and accept coffee and zabaglione",
    "I am especially open to sadness and hilarity",
    "since my father died as a child",
    "one week ago in this his ninetieth year"
