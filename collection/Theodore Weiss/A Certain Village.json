    "Once in late summer,",
    "the road already deep in twilight,",
    "mixing colors with some straggly",
    "wildflowers, I came to a village",
    "I did not know was there",
    "until",
    "I stepped into its narrow street.",
    "Admiring the prim, white houses",
    "nestled among their veteran,",
    "lofty trees,",
    "I found myself in",
    "a tiny square with a little dawdl-",
    "ing fountain and a rickety tower,",
    "its owlish clock absentmindedly",
    "counting minutes now and then.",
    "And in the fountain the face",
    "of morning seemed to linger as",
    "though searching. The air was fresh,",
    "breathing out the fragrances",
    "of a recent shower.",
    "I luxuriated",
    "in my senses, like meeting",
    "unexpectedly a pack of friends",
    "years and years unthought of, laden",
    "with all kinds of gifts.",
    "Then",
    "as I stopped to knock at the door",
    "of a house that had seemed occupied",
    "with happy noises, a silence",
    "fell on it,",
    "the light went out\u2014",
    "and was it instant eyes like flakes,",
    "ten thousand, thousand flakes,",
    "and all unknowing, flurried",
    "round me?",
    "Wherever I turned",
    "I was met by the unmistakable",
    "accusation, \u201cStranger!\u201d I, who had,",
    "I thought, begun here and who now",
    "required lodgings",
    "for the night,",
    "was denied and from the start."
