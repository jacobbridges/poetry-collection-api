    "one lies in rags on the street",
    "and his stomach is empty",
    "and he wishes for death",
    "one sits with friends at tea and backgammon",
    "and his mind is empty",
    "and he wishes for death",
    "one sits in a straight-backed chair at a desk",
    "and his bank account is empty",
    "and he wishes for death",
    "one lies in bed staring out to sea",
    "and the place next to him in bed is empty",
    "and he wishes for death",
    "one flies back with food in its beak",
    "and its nest is empty",
    "and only this one says",
    "we should give it another try"
