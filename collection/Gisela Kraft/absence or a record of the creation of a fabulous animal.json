    "on the first day you were beautiful and good",
    "on the second you grew a horn",
    "on the third a lead-gray wing budded",
    "from your shoulder",
    "on the fourth a claw sprouted from your shoe",
    "on the fifth you flew",
    "right into my armpit",
    "built a nest and then lost interest",
    "on the sixth you were a host of leeches",
    "having their way with my veins",
    "on the seventh I heard you",
    "trotting above me with hollow hoof beats",
    "on the eighth you went to moses to ask for advice",
    "winged horned buraq the prophet\u2019s steed",
    "returned as a lamb on the ninth",
    "to graze on my belly fur",
    "on the tenth you died for isaac",
    "the angel decided in favor of animal testing",
    "on the eleventh I had forgotten the color of your eyes",
    "on the twelfth day you were poor and naked",
    "on the thirteenth you were lying on the bottom of the sea",
    "a millions of eons old whispering mussel",
    "on the fourteenth they called you into the field",
    "duldul, ali\u2019s tireless gray mule",
    "on the fifteenth you stood still",
    "welded on the lip of a kettle",
    "the sweat of the holy brew had oxidized",
    "your copper neck",
    "on the sixteenth you were the primordial ox",
    "zarathustra sang of your suffering",
    "on the seventeenth day when I came home",
    "you were once again the one human being"
