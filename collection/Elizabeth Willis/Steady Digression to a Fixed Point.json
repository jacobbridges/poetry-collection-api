    "When a body has been rearranged, it is held together with a rose.",
    "A rose is a weapon, a guide, a compass.",

    "We piece together an aftermath.",
    "\u201cYou\u201d is how we talk to ourselves. \u201cWe\u201d is an I that sees itself among others. An assemblage makes of I a \u201cwe.\u201d",
    "An assemblage is a body for which there is no escape.",
    "A bear, a fish, a chance wheeling in the dark.",
    "A man lifts the girl into a box. By what magic is she sawn in half only for the artist to reassemble her before our eyes?",

    "A rose disarms the face of its enemy. Even a bejeweled prince succumbs to this flowering.",
    "In",
    "the landscape has been all but erased to show an internal topography.",
    "Rose worried. Rose accepting a drink. Rose holding the monkey like a baby.",
    "Rose accepting a man\u2019s arm. Rose in a dress vaguely suggestive of bondage. Rose in a suit and tie.",

    "Throw the line into the air and climb until there\u2019s nothing.",
    "There is no witness to a rose-colored future.",
    "In the sacred disorder of the box, a rosary. It\u2019s not telling us how to think about the hour of our death. It\u2019s making a hole large enough to draw a thread through. Long enough to pull a woman back out of the labyrinth.",

    "We are on the river, East of Borneo. We are east of an island, as Queens is east of Manhattan.",
    "We are in the valley of the stars.",
    "This is Rose out of sequence. Rose on the ledge. A knife in a garden.",
    "The cut at the end of the take. The scene. The reel. The movie.",
    "This is a movie about The End. Of Colonialism.",
    "A rose may blow from Liverpool to New Orleans, from California to Kalimantan. Worked. Worshipped. Grafted. Shipped.",
    "This is the end of exploration. The well-dressed wife coming to salvage the explorer from his native informants.",
    "This is a film about a movie. A movie revolving around a star.",
    "The sun is our star. It is the star of",
    ".",
    "We are watching the death of the Sun, a star disappearing, the bulb burning out. A body buried alive in a film, in a can.",
    "The End is behind a curtain, it is in her purse, it is rising to the surface.",

    "This is a movie about silence. About speaking with your eyes. The heart racing as she strides across the room.",
    "A poem about a volcano, a film about the interior.",
    "What is drawn in the drawing room. What is assembled in the basement. What is taken apart on the table.",
    "The making of a body through a series of omissions.",
    "The violence of the studio system. The California sun. The snowy taupe of the cathode light of Hollywood as seen on TV.",
    "This is a poem about the star system and its ancient astronomer. About a poet of the outer boroughs, looking up. An image thrown into the sky like a searchlight.",
    "This is a poem about a fox. An alligator. The misplaced animals of the backlot.",

    "About looking into the face of desire until it blinks.",
    "Dear Paolo. I dreamed I would write this. I dreamed a rose was coming out of my mouth in the middle of the greatest city in the world. I dreamed the image of a rose opened in the Museum. It moved in its box like a girl buried alive.",
    "Rose moves inside this blue light. She\u2019s coming down. She\u2019s skating on a shiny disk. She\u2019s walking upside down across the surface of your lens.",
    "Dear Rose, I always wanted to be a star projected onto a blinding white screen. I wanted to be found like a volcanic island. To carry myself through the California air as if I lived in the filtered light of an imaginary jungle. To feel the prickly glitter of the thin lam\u00e9 gown I was given to walk through the moonlight.",
    "In the middle of the scene, Rose draws apart the curtain and crosses a threshold. She crosses the river from object to subject.",
    "The artist points to her, as to a silent archive of events.",
    "She is going to become the film\u2019s only word.",
    "He is moving her body from his eye to yours.",
    "He is saying this film is also a mirror, as all desire is a kind of mirror.",
