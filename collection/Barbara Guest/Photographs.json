    "In the past we listened to photographs. They heard our voice speak.",
    "Alive, active. What had been distance was memory. Dusk came,",
    "Pushed us forward, emptying the laboratory each night undisturbed by",
    "Erasure.",
    "In the city of X, they lived together. Always morose, her lips",
