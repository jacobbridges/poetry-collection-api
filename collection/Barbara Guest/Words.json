    "The simple contact with a wooden spoon and the word",
    "recovered itself, began to spread as grass, forced",
    "as it lay sprawling to consider the monument where",
    "patience looked at grief, where warfare ceased",
    "eyes curled outside themes to search the paper",
    "now gleaming and potent, wise and resilient, word",
    "entered its continent eager to find another as",
    "capable as a thorn. The nearest possession would",
    "house them both, they being then two might glide",
    "into this house and presently create a rather larger",
    "mansion filled with spoons and condiments, gracious",
    "as a newly laid table where related objects might gather",
    "to enjoy the interplay of gravity upon facetious hints,",
    "the chocolate dish presuming an endowment, the ladle",
    "of galactic rhythm primed as a relish dish, curved",
    "knives, finger bowls, morsel carriages words might",
    "choose and savor before swallowing so much was the",
    "sumptuousness and substance of a rented house where words",
    "placed dressing gowns as rosemary entered their scent",
    "percipient as elder branches in the night where words",
    "gathered, warped, then straightened, marking new wands."
