    "1. Falmouth, Massachusetts, 1972",
    "Oak table, knotted legs, the chirp",
    "And scrape of tines to mouth.",
    "Four children, four engines",
    "Of want. That music.",
    "What did your hand mean to smooth",
    "Across the casket of your belly?",
    "What echoed there, if not me\u2014tiny body",
    "Afloat, akimbo, awake or at rest?",
    "Every night you fed the others",
    "Bread leavened with the grains",
    "Of your own want. How",
    "Could you stand me near you,",
    "In you, jump and kick tricking",
    "The heart, when what you prayed for",
    "Was my father\u2019s shadow, your name",
    "In his dangerous script, an envelope",
    "Smelling of gun-powder, bay rum,",
    "Someone to wrestle, sing to, question,",
    "Climb?",
    "2. Interstate 101 South, California, 1981",
    "Remember the radio, the Coca-Cola sign",
    "Phosphorescent to the left, bridge",
    "After bridge, as though our lives were",
    "Engineered simply to go? And so we went",
    "Into those few quiet hours",
    "Alone together in the dark, my arm",
    "On the rest beside yours, our lights",
    "Pricking at fog, tugging us patiently",
    "Forward like a needle through gauze.",
    "Night held us like a house.",
    "Sometimes an old song",
    "Would fill the car like a ghost.",
    "3. Leroy, Alabama, 2005",
    "There\u2019s still a pond behind your mother\u2019s old house,",
    "Still a stable with horses, a tractor rusted and stuck",
    "Like a trophy in mud. And the red house you might",
    "Have thrown stones at still stands on stilts up the dirt road.",
    "A girl from the next town over rides in to lend us",
    "Her colt, cries when one of us kicks it with spurs.",
    "Her father wants to buy her a trailer, let her try her luck",
    "In the shows. They stay for dinner under the tent",
    "Your brother put up for the Fourth. Firebugs flare",
    "And vanish. I am trying to let go of something.",
    "My heart cluttered with names that mean nothing.",
    "Our racket races out to the darkest part of the night.",
    "The woods catch it and send it back.",
    "4. But let\u2019s say you\u2019re alive again\u2014",
    "Your hands are long and tell your age.",
    "You hold them there, twirling a bent straw,",
    "And my reflection watches, hollow-faced,",
    "Not trying to hide. The waiters make it seem",
    "Like Cairo. Back and forth shouting",
    "That sharp language. And for the first time",
    "I tell you everything. No shame",
    "In my secrets, shoddy as laundry.",
    "I have praised your God",
    "For the blessing of the body, snuck",
    "From pleasure to pleasure, lying for it,",
    "Holding it like a coin or a key in my fist.",
    "I know now you\u2019ve known all along.",
    "I won\u2019t change. I want to give",
    "Everything away. To wander forever.",
    "Here is a pot of tea. Let\u2019s share it",
    "Slowly, like sisters."
