    "There will be no edges, but curves.",
    "Clean lines pointing only forward.",
    "History, with its hard spine & dog-eared",
    "Corners, will be replaced with nuance,",
    "Just like the dinosaurs gave way",
    "To mounds and mounds of ice.",
    "Women will still be women, but",
    "The distinction will be empty. Sex,",
    "Having outlived every threat, will gratify",
    "Only the mind, which is where it will exist.",
    "For kicks, we'll dance for ourselves",
    "Before mirrors studded with golden bulbs.",
    "The oldest among us will recognize that glow\u2014",
    "But the word",
    "will have been re-assigned",
    "To the Standard Uranium-Neutralizing device",
    "Found in households and nursing homes.",
    "And yes, we'll live to be much older, thanks",
    "To popular consensus. Weightless, unhinged,",
    "Eons from even our own moon, we'll drift",
    "In the haze of space, which will be, once",
    "And for all, scrutable and safe."
