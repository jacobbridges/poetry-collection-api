    "But sometimes I forget where I am,",
    "Imagine myself inside that life again.",
    "Recalcitrant mornings. Sun perhaps,",
    "Or more likely colorless light",
    "Filtering its way through shapeless cloud.",
    "And when I begin to believe I haven\u2019t left,",
    "The rest comes back. Our couch. My smoke",
    "Climbing the walls while the hours fall.",
    "Straining against the noise of traffic, music,",
    "Anything alive, to catch your key in the door.",
    "And that scamper of feeling in my chest,",
    "As if the day, the night, wherever it is",
    "I am by then, has been only a whir",
    "Of something other than waiting.",
    "We hear so much about what love feels like.",
    "Right now, today, with the rain outside,",
    "And leaves that want as much as I do to believe",
    "In May, in seasons that come when called,",
    "It\u2019s impossible not to want",
    "To walk into the next room and let you",
    "Run your hands down the sides of my legs,",
    "Knowing perfectly well what they know."
