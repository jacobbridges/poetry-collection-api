    "I hid my love when young till I",
    "Couldn't bear the buzzing of a fly;",
    "I hid my love to my despite",
    "Till I could not bear to look at light:",
    "I dare not gaze upon her face",
    "But left her memory in each place;",
    "Where'er I saw a wild flower lie",
    "I kissed and bade my love good-bye.",
    "I met her in the greenest dells,",
    "Where dewdrops pearl the wood bluebells;",
    "The lost breeze kissed her bright blue eye,",
    "The bee kissed and went singing by,",
    "A sunbeam found a passage there,",
    "A gold chain round her neck so fair;",
    "As secret as the wild bee's song",
    "She lay there all the summer long.",
    "I hid my love in field and town",
    "Till e'en the breeze would knock me down;",
    "The bees seemed singing ballads o'er,",
    "The fly's bass turned a lion's roar;",
    "And even silence found a tongue,",
    "To haunt me all the summer long;",
    "The riddle nature could not prove",
    "Was nothing else but secret love."
