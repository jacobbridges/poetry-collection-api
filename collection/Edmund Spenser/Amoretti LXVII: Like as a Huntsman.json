    "Like as a huntsman after weary chase,",
    "Seeing the game from him escap'd away,",
    "Sits down to rest him in some shady place,",
    "With panting hounds beguiled of their prey:",
    "So after long pursuit and vain assay,",
    "When I all weary had the chase forsook,",
    "The gentle deer return'd the self-same way,",
    "Thinking to quench her thirst at the next brook.",
    "There she beholding me with milder look,",
    "Sought not to fly, but fearless still did bide:",
    "Till I in hand her yet half trembling took,",
    "And with her own goodwill her firmly tied.",
    "Strange thing, me seem'd, to see a beast so wild,",
    "So goodly won, with her own will beguil'd."
