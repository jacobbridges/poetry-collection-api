    "or arrow of carnations that propagate fire:",

    "secretly, between the shadow and the soul.",

    "the light of those flowers, hidden, within itself,",
    "and thanks to your love the tight aroma that arose",
    "from the earth lives dimly in my body.",
    "I love you without knowing how, or when, or from where,",
    "I love you directly without problems or pride:",
    "I love you like this because I don\u2019t know any other way to love,",
    "except in this form in which I am not nor are you,",
    "so close that your hand upon my chest is mine,",
    "so close that your eyes close with my dreams."
