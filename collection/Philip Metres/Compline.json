    "That we await a blessed hope,",
    "that we will be struck",
    "With great fear, like a baby taken into the night, that every boot,",

    "Hornet, Molotov",
    "rubber-coated bullet, every unexploded cluster bomblet,",

    "suicide vest",
    "unpiloted drone raining fire",
    "On wedding parties will be burned as fuel in the dark season.",
    "That we will learn the awful hunger of God, the nerve-fraying",
    "Cry of God, the curdy vomit of God, the soiled swaddle of God,",
    "The constant wakefulness of God, alongside the sweet scalp",
    "Of God, the contented murmur of God, the limb-twitched dream-",
    "Reaching of God. We\u2019re dizzy in every departure, limb-lost.",
    "We cannot sleep in the wake of God,",
    "God will not sleep",
    "The infant dream for long. We lift the blinds, look out into ink",
    "For light. My God, my God, open the spine binding our sight."
