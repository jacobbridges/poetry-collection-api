    "There\u2019s a farm auction up the road.",
    "Wind has its bid in for the leaves.",
    "Already bugs flurry the headlights",
    "between cornfields at night.",
    "If this world were permanent,",
    "I could dance full as the squaw dress",
    "on the clothesline.",
    "I would not see winter",
    "in the square of white yard-light on the wall.",
    "But something tugs at me.",
    "The world is at a loss and I am part of it",
    "migrating daily.",
    "Everything is up for grabs",
    "like a box of farm tools broken open.",
    "I hear the spirits often in the garden",
    "and along the shore of corn.",
    "I know this place is not mine.",
    "I hear them up the road again.",
    "This world is a horizon, an open sea.",
    "Behind the house, the white iceberg of the barn."
