    "Mother is drinking to forget a man",
    "who could fill the woods with invitations:",
    "come with me he whispered and she went",
    "in his Nash Rambler, its dash",
    "where her knees turned green",
    "in the radium dials of the 50's.",
    "When I drink it is always 1953,",
    "bacon wilting in the pan on Cook Street",
    "and mother, wrist deep in red water,",
    "laying a trail from the sink",
    "to a glass of gin and back.",
    "She is a beautiful, unlucky woman",
    "in love with a man of lechery so solid",
    "you could build a table on it",
    "and when you did the blues would come to visit.",
    "I remember all of us awkwardly at dinner,",
    "the dark slung across the porch,",
    "and then mother\u2019s dress falling to the floor,",
    "buttons ticking like seeds spit on a plate.",
    "When I drink I am too much like her\u2014",
    "the knife in one hand and the trout",
    "with a belly white as my wrist.",
    "I have loved you all my life",
    "she told him and it was true",
    "in the same way that all her life",
    "she drank, dedicated to the act itself,",
    "she stood at this stove",
    "and with the care of the very drunk",
    "handed him the plate."
