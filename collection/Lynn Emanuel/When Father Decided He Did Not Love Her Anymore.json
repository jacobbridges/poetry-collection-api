    "Tonight I will remember the model",
    "With the wide, sad mouth",
    "Who used to pose for father",
    "Because I love the dangers of memory,",
    "The boarded window and door,",
    "Rooms where one bare bulb",
    "Makes shadows swell up the wall.",
    "And yet I recall only vaguely",
    "The way her hem rustled on the floor",
    "Like sand against tin",
    "Laisse-moi tranquille, epicier,",
    "It said because I want it to",
    "Say something memorable.",
    "I want her back",
    "That brilliant, farfetched woman",
    "Who drank coffee in our garden",
    "And the days father fed me",
    "Absinthe through a sugar cube",
    "So I would be asleep by noon",
    "And wake to find Ramona posing",
    "Naked with a tambourine.",
    "Tonight the whole world is a garden",
    "In which the immortal whispers",
    "Something about art",
    "And its opportunities:",
    "Memory like a bolt of silk",
    "In a tailor\u2019s arms",
    "Can be made into anything",
    "Especially misfortune,",
    "Especially the year Ramona spent",
    "In a wrath almost Biblical",
    "And so far from the world",
    "Not even the moon could find",
    "Her study in Paris",
    "Where the doors opened to the river."
