    "In Tunis we try to discuss divorce",
    "And dying but give up to lounge",
    "With rug merchants under a plum tree.",
    "From its corner the lamb\u2019s severed head",
    "Watches the flies drink from its eyes",
    "And its fat disappear into the fire.",
    "The light rinses the edge of your sandal,",
    "The two wasps that ornament the blur",
    "Of screened window. My grandmother",
    "Would have loved a night like this.",
    "In the wind chimes I can hear her tea cart",
    "With its china rolling through Cook Street\u2019s",
    "Stony yard one summer when I was always",
    "Thirsty, and she moved like a figure",
    "On a clock from my lawn chair to the cart,",
    "Or swabbed me with alcohol, or cut",
    "My hair with the straight razor.",
    "I was a week out of the hospital.",
    "Beneath my breasts an incision was crossed",
    "With stitches of surgical thread.",
    "The scalpel came so close it gave",
    "My heart a quick kiss. I nearly died.",
    "Years later I can still see the skin",
    "Flutter on the inside of my left breast",
    "And my heart limps like a great uncle",
    "Who, because he was a Jew and lame,",
    "Was dragged by cossacks across the steppes.",
    "He became a friend asking a favor",
    "Of a horse who ran so hard, so perfectly",
    "Hard, that the green grass rose to meet him."
