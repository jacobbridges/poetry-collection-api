    "Outside the window the McGill smelter",
    "sent a red dust down on the smoking yards of copper,",
    "on the railroad tracks\u2019 frayed ends disappeared",
    "into the congestion of the afternoon. Ely lay dull",
    "and scuffed: a miner\u2019s boot toe worn away and dim,",
    "while my mother knelt before the Philco to coax",
    "the detonation from the static. From the Las Vegas",
    "Tonapah Artillery and Gunnery Range the sound",
    "of the atom bomb came biting like a swarm",
    "of bees. We sat in the hot Nevada dark, delighted,",
    "when the switch was tripped and the bomb hoisted",
    "up its silky, hooded, glittering, uncoiling length;",
    "it hissed and spit, it sizzled like a poker in a toddy.",
    "The bomb was no mind and all body; it sent a fire",
    "of static down the spine. In the dark it glowed like the coils",
    "of an electric stove. It stripped every leaf from every",
    "branch until a willow by a creek was a bouquet",
    "of switches resinous, naked, flexible, and fine.",
    "Bathed in the light of KDWN, Las Vegas,",
    "my crouched mother looked radioactive, swampy,",
    "glaucous, like something from the Planet Krypton.",
    "In the suave, brilliant wattage of the bomb, we were",
    "not poor. In the atom\u2019s fizz and pop we heard possibility",
    "uncorked. Taffeta wraps whispered on davenports.",
    "A new planet bloomed above us; in its light",
    "the stumps of cut pine gleamed like dinner plates.",
    "The world was beginning all over again, fresh and hot;",
    "we could have anything we wanted."
