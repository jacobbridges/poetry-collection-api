    "This was the winter mother told time by my heart",
    "ticking like a frayed fan belt in my chest.",
    "This was the fifties & we were living on nothing",
    "& what of her, the black girl, my own black nurse,",
    "what of her who arrived on Greyhound in the heart",
    "of so dramatic a storm it froze the sleeves at her wrists",
    "& each nostril was rimed with white like salt on a glass,",
    "what of her who came up the dark stair on the limp of her",
    "own bad ticker, weary, arrogant, thin, her suitcase noosed",
    "with rope, in the grip of a rage she came, a black woman,",
    "into our white lives, like a splinter, & stayed. Charming",
    "& brilliantly condescending, she leaned down to kiss \u201cthe baby,\u201d",
    "& hissed",
    "& hushed the Jordan & set the chariots",
    "on the golden streets &",
    ", I cried to her, & went out like a light."
