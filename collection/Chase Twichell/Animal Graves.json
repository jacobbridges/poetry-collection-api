    "The mower flipped it belly up,",
    "a baby garter less than a foot long,",
    "dull green with a single sharp",
    "stripe of pale manila down its back,",
    "same color as the underside",
    "which was cut in two places,",
    "a loop of intestine poking out.",
    "It wouldn't live,",
    "so I ran the blades over it again,",
    "and cut it again but didn\u2019t kill it,",
    "and again and then again,",
    "a cloud of two-cycle fuel smoke",
    "on me like a swarm of bees.",
    "It took so long",
    "my mind had time to spiral",
    "back to the graveyard",
    "I tended as a child",
    "for the dead ones, wild and tame:",
    "fish from the bubbling green aquarium,",
    "squirrels from the road,",
    "the bluejay stalked to a raucous death",
    "by Cicero the patient, the tireless hunter,",
    "who himself was laid to rest",
    "one August afternoon",
    "under a rock painted gray, his color,",
    "with a white splash for his white splash.",
    "Once in the woods I found the skeleton",
    "of a deer laid out like a diagram,",
    "long spine curved like a necklace of crude, ochre spools",
    "with the string rotted away,",
    "and the dull metal shaft of the arrow",
    "lying where it must have pierced",
    "not the heart, not the head,",
    "but the underbelly, the soft part",
    "where the sex once was.",
    "I carried home the skull",
    "with its nubs of not-yet-horns",
    "which the mice had overlooked,",
    "and set it on a rock",
    "in my kingdom of the dead.",
    "Before I chopped the little snake",
    "to bits of raw mosaic,",
    "it drew itself",
    "into an upward-straining coil,",
    "head weaving, mouth open,",
    "hissing at the noise that hurt it.",
    "The stripe was made",
    "of tiny paper diamonds,",
    "sharp-edged but insubstantial,",
    "like an x-ray of the spine",
    "or the ghost beginning to pull away.",
    "What taught the snake to make itself",
    "seem bigger than it was,",
    "to spend those last few seconds",
    "dancing in the roar",
    "and shadow of its death?",
    "Now I see, though none exists,",
    "its grave:",
    "harebells withered in a jar,",
    "a yellow spiral",
    "painted on a green-black stone,",
    "a ring of upright pine cones for a fence.",
    "That\u2019s how the deer skull lay in state",
    "until one of the neighborhood dogs",
    "came to claim it,",
    "and carried it off to bury",
    "in the larger graveyard of the world."
