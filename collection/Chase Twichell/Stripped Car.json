    "There\u2019s something in me that likes",
    "to imagine the things I\u2019m afraid of,",
    "for example, the future.",
    "I don\u2019t mean the celestial fireworks",
    "from melting reactors, or New York",
    "under six feet of sea water,",
    "but the future in its most intimate,",
    "most probable forms\u2014vignettes",
    "subversive enough to slip through the radar.",
    "That\u2019s how I come to be crouched",
    "behind a stripped car wondering",
    "would it be too dangerous",
    "to piss in the street?",
    "It would, I\u2019m a woman.",
    "So I go on holding it,",
    "distracting myself by trying to remember",
    "every fruit I\u2019ve ever eaten,",
    "their exact textures and flavors.",
    "So far the most exotic is the custard apple.",
    "I use up a whole hour of daylight",
    "and then another\u2014apricot, blueberry, plum\u2014",
    "calves cramping from having to stay low,",
    "waiting behind a car pitted",
    "with the acne of automatic fire.",
    "There are still too many guns",
    "walking around out there,",
    "and no one I know,",
    "so I\u2019m waiting for twilight at least.",
    "Is everyone alone now?",
    "The wind says so. It says",
    "a winter is coming without oil.",
    "It bites to get my attention",
    "and scatters a few leaflets,",
    "pictures of a blackened car,",
    "a city that seems to catch on fire",
    "every sunset, though there\u2019s",
    "little enough to burn. Stone only chars.",
    "This isn\u2019t a likeness of the future, is it?",
    "Every person in the street a stranger?",
    "Will a word like \u2018neighbor\u2019 survive this?",
    "I fired a gun once. It smelled rancid, sour,",
    "like bad food. It hurt my shoulder",
    "and left a wound of oil on my shirt.",
    "My mind is thinking of sleep again.",
    "Sleep lets things escape\u2014my pocket-knife",
    "vanished through a knife-sized hole.",
    "There\u2019s nothing to cut,",
    "no guava, nectarine, winter pear,",
    "and nothing left of the car at all,",
    "not even the rear-view mirror",
    "I was counting on,",
    "hoping my face could tell me",
    "it was safe to go home, and where is that?",
    "A place with a bed",
    "and a desk where I sit and plot",
    "next year\u2019s garden on graph paper.",
    "The skin of a tangelo is faintly pebbly,",
    "easy to peel, but the sweetest citrus",
    "is the satsuma, then the clementine.",
    "If I had to choose between natural",
    "disaster and a firing squad,",
    "I\u2019d take the river of lava any day.",
    "Hurricane, tidal wave, tornado, drought.",
    "I want the earth, which is waiting",
    "under the sidewalk, to be the one.",
    "Not any of these human shadows",
    "sporting their silhouetted guns.",
    "There were gun shadows before,",
    "but the two worlds overlapped,",
    "guns and the amber waves of grain.",
    "It\u2019s hard to say whether bramble fruits",
    "actually have skins. Does a rasberry?",
    "Does each tiny globe have its own?",
    "How will I live without the earth?",
    "In a stripped car, unable to piss",
    "when I want to, all the time cold?",
    "Maybe weapons interbred with humans,",
    "and a strain of hybrids was born,",
    "half metal, half flesh.",
    "I know there\u2019s an enemy\u2014",
    "look at all the damage it\u2019s doing.",
    "Maybe it\u2019s still a baby,",
    "its weak neck wobbling as its carriage",
    "lurches over the broken pavement.",
    "But probably by now",
    "it\u2019s a sulking adolescent",
    "starting to look like serious trouble,",
    "with a silky little shadow-moustache",
    "and a gun. Who\u2019ll kill it? Will I?",
    "What if it doesn\u2019t look like the enemy?",
    "What if it comes disguised as a savior,",
    "or resembles nothing so much as hunger,",
    "so that everyone has his own",
    "private piece to kill? Will we do it?"
