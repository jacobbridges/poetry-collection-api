    "It is the dark of the moon.",
    "Late at night, the end of summer,",

    "Glow in the arid heaven.",
    "The air smells of cattle, hay,",
    "And dust. In the old orchard",
    "The pears are ripe. The trees",
    "Have sprouted from old rootstocks",
    "And the fruit is inedible.",
    "As I pass them I hear something",
    "Rustling and grunting and turn",
    "My light into the branches.",
    "Two raccoons with acrid pear",
    "Juice and saliva drooling",
    "From their mouths stare back at me,",
    "Their eyes deep sponges of light.",
    "They know me and do not run",
    "Away. Coming up the road",
    "Through the black oak shadows, I",
    "See ahead of me, glinting",
    "Everywhere from the dusty",
    "Gravel, tiny points of cold",
    "Blue light, like the sparkle of",
    "Iron snow. I suspect what it is,",
    "And kneel to see. Under each",
    "Pebble and oak leaf is a",
    "Spider, her eyes shining at",
    "Me with my reflected light",
    "Across immeasurable distance."
