  "text": [
    "The mountain road ends here,",
    "Broken away in the chasm where",
    "The bridge washed out years ago.",
    "The first scarlet larkspur glitters",
    "In the first patch of April",
    "Morning sunlight. The engorged creek",
    "Roars and rustles like a military",
    "Ball. Here by the waterfall,",
    "Insuperable life, flushed",
    "With the equinox, sentient",
    "And sentimental, falls away",
    "To the sea and death. The tissue",
    "Of sympathy and agony",
    "That binds the flesh in its Nessus' shirt;",
    "The clotted cobweb of unself",
    "And self; sheds itself and flecks",
    "The sun's bed with darts of blossom",
    "Like flagellant blood above",
    "The water bursting in the vibrant",
    "Air. This ego, bound by personal",
    "Tragedy and the vast",
    "Impersonal vindictiveness",
    "Of the ruined and ruining world,",
    "Pauses in this immortality,",
    "As passionate, as apathetic,",
    "As the lava flow that burned here once;",
    "And stopped here; and said, 'This far",
    "And no further.' And spoke thereafter",
    "In the simple diction of stone.",
    "Naked in the warm April air,",
    "We lie under the redwoods,",
    "In the sunny lee of a cliff.",
    "As you kneel above me I see",
    "Tiny red marks on your flanks",
    "Like bites, where the redwood cones",
    "Have pressed into your flesh.",
    "You can find just the same marks",
    "In the lignite in the cliff",
    "Over our heads.",
    "Langsdorfii before the ice,",
    "And",
    "afterwards,",
    "There is little difference,",
    "Except for all those years.",
    "Here in the sweet, moribund",
    "Fetor of spring flowers, washed,",
    "Flotsam and jetsam together,",
    "Cool and naked together,",
    "Under this tree for a moment,",
    "We have escaped the bitterness",
    "Of love, and love lost, and love",
    "Betrayed. And what might have been,",
    "And what might be, fall equally",
    "Away with what is, and leave",
    "Only these ideograms",
    "Printed on the immortal",
    "Hydrocarbons of flesh and stone."
