    "You were a girl of satin and gauze",
    "Now you are my mountain and waterfall companion.",
    "Long ago I read those lines of Po Chu I",
    "Written in his middle age.",
    "Young as I was they touched me.",
    "I never thought in my own middle age",
    "I would have a beautiful young dancer",
    "To wander with me by falling crystal waters,",
    "Among mountains of snow and granite,",
    "Least of all that unlike Po\u2019s girl",
    "She would be my very daughter.",
    "The earth turns towards the sun.",
    "Summer comes to the mountains.",
    "Blue grouse drum in the red fir woods",
    "All the bright long days.",
    "You put blue jay and flicker feathers",
    "In your hair.",
    "Two and two violet green swallows",
    "Play over the lake.",
    "The blue birds have come back",
    "To nest on the little island.",
    "The swallows sip water on the wing",
    "And play at love and dodge and swoop",
    "Just like the swallows that swirl",
    "Under and over the Ponte Vecchio.",
    "Light rain crosses the lake",
    "Hissing faintly. After the rain",
    "There are giant puffballs with tortoise shell backs",
    "At the edge of the meadow.",
    "Snows of a thousand winters",
    "Melt in the sun of one summer.",
    "Wild cyclamen bloom by the stream.",
    "Trout veer in the transparent current.",
    "In the evening marmots bark in the rocks.",
    "The Scorpion curls over the glimmering ice field.",
    "A white crowned night sparrow sings as the moon sets.",
    "Thunder growls far off.",
    "Our campfire is a single light",
    "Amongst a hundred peaks and waterfalls.",
    "The manifold voices of falling water",
    "Talk all night.",
    "Wrapped in your down bag",
    "Starlight on your cheeks and eyelids",
    "Your breath comes and goes",
    "In a tiny cloud in the frosty night.",
    "Ten thousand birds sing in the sunrise.",
    "Ten thousand years revolve without change.",
    "All this will never be again."
