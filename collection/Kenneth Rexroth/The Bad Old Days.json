    "The summer of nineteen eighteen",
    "I read",
    "and",
    "That fall",
    "My father died and my aunt",
    "Took me to Chicago to live.",
    "The first thing I did was to take",
    "A streetcar to the stockyards.",
    "In the winter afternoon,",
    "Gritty and fetid, I walked",
    "Through the filthy snow, through the",
    "Squalid streets, looking shyly",
    "Into the people\u2019s faces,",
    "Those who were home in the daytime.",
    "Debauched and exhausted faces,",
    "Starved and looted brains, faces",
    "Like the faces in the senile",
    "And insane wards of charity",
    "Hospitals. Predatory",
    "Faces of little children.",
    "Then as the soiled twilight darkened,",
    "Under the green gas lamps, and the",
    "Sputtering purple arc lamps,",
    "The faces of the men coming",
    "Home from work, some still alive with",
    "The last pulse of hope or courage,",
    "Some sly and bitter, some smart and",
    "Silly, most of them already",
    "Broken and empty, no life,",
    "Only blinding tiredness, worse",
    "Than any tired animal.",
    "The sour smells of a thousand",
    "Suppers of fried potatoes and",
    "Fried cabbage bled into the street.",
    "I was giddy and sick, and out",
    "Of my misery I felt rising",
    "A terrible anger and out",
    "Of the anger, an absolute vow.",
    "Today the evil is clean",
    "And prosperous, but it is",
    "Everywhere, you don\u2019t have to",
    "Take a streetcar to find it,",
    "And it is the same evil.",
    "And the misery, and the",
    "Anger, and the vow are the same."
