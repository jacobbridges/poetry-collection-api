    "The day my body caught fire",
    "the woodland darkened. The horizon",
    "was a sea of maids, rushing to piece me",

    "The meadow was a narration of lessness.",
    "Inside the corral, horses fell",
    "from the impact of lightning. They broke",
    "down. I heard gunshots in my sleep.",
    "I was a keeper of breath,",
    "of hay. I walked a field, collecting bones.",
    "You can build a house out of bones.",
    "You can stand at the doorway",
    "quarrelling with your legs to enter",
    "or run until you turn to ash."
