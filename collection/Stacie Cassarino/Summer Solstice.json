    "I wanted to see where beauty comes from",
    "without you in the world, hauling my heart",
    "across sixty acres of northeast meadow,",
    "my pockets filling with flowers.",
    "Then I remembered,",
    "it\u2019s you I miss in the brightness",
    "and body of every living name:",
    "rattlebox, yarrow, wild vetch.",
    "You are the green wonder of June,",
    "root and quasar, the thirst for salt.",
    "When I finally understand that people fail",
    "at love, what is left but cinquefoil, thistle,",
    "the paper wings of the dragonfly",
    "aeroplaning the soul with a sudden blue hilarity?",
    "If I get the story right, desire is continuous,",
    "equatorial. There is still so much",
    "I want to know: what you believe",
    "can never be removed from us,",
    "what you dreamed on Walnut Street",
    "in the unanswerable dark of your childhood,",
    "learning pleasure on your own.",
    "Tell me our story: are we impetuous,",
    "are we kind to each other, do we surrender",
    "to what the mind cannot think past?",
    "Where is the evidence I will learn",
    "to be good at loving?",
    "The black dog orbits the horseshoe pond",
    "for treefrogs in their plangent emergencies.",
    "There are violet hills,",
    "there is the covenant of duskbirds.",
    "The moon comes over the mountain",
    "like a big peach, and I want to tell you",
    "what I couldn\u2019t say the night we rushed",
    "North, how I love the seriousness of your fingers",
    "and the way you go into yourself,",
    "calling my half-name like a secret.",
    "I stand between taproot and treespire.",
    "Here is the compass rose",
    "to help me live through this.",
    "Here are twelve ways of knowing",
    "what blooms even in the blindness",
    "of such longing. Yellow oxeye,",
    "viper\u2019s bugloss with its set of pink arms",
    "pleading do not forget me.",
    "We hunger for eloquence.",
    "We measure the isopleths.",
    "I am visiting my life with reckless plenitude.",
    "The air is fragrant with tiny strawberries.",
    "Fireflies turn on their electric wills:",
    "an effulgence. Let me come back",
    "whole, let me remember how to touch you",
    "before it is too late."
