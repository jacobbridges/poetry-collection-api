    "If I close my eyes now, I can still see them",
    "canopied by the visor of my sunhat:",
    "three children islanded on a narrow rim",
    "of earth between the huge crack-willow that",
    "they squat before, hushed, poised to net a frog,",
    "and the pond the frog will jump to (it got away)",
    "a glass its dive will shatter.",
    "The unbroken image",
    "pleases my mind\u2019s eye with its density,",
    "such thick crisscross of tree-trunk, earth, and tall grass",
    "I see no breach, no source for the light that steeps it",
    "but a blue burning in the pond\u2019s green glass.",
    "The grass withered, the tree blew down, earth caught",
    "the frog, the children grew. Sky\u2019s ice-blue flame",
    "teased along the wick it would consume."
