    "To those fair isles where crimson sunsets burn,",
    "We send a backward glance to gaze on thee,",
    "Brave Toussaint! thou was surely born to be",
    "A hero; thy proud spirit could but spurn",
    "Each outrage on the race. Couldst thou unlearn",
    "The lessons taught by instinct? Nay! and we",
    "Who share the zeal that would make all men free,",
    "Must e\u2019en with pride unto thy life-work turn.",
    "Soul-dignity was thine and purest aim;",
    "And ah! how sad that thou wast left to mourn",
    "In chains \u2019neath alien skies. On him, shame! shame!",
    "That mighty conqueror who dared to claim",
    "The right to bind thee. Him we heap with scorn,",
    "And noble patriot! guard with love thy name."
