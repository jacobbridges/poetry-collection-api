    "Would it surprise you to learn",
    "that years beyond your longest winter",
    "you still get letters from your bank, your old",
    "philanthropies, cold flakes drifting",
    "through the mail-slot with your name?",
    "Though it's been a long time since your face",
    "interrupted the light in my door-frame,",
    "and the last tremblings of your voice",
    "have drained from my telephone wire,",
    "from the lists of the likely, your name",
    "is not missing. It circles in the shadow-world",
    "of the machines, a wind-blown ghost. For generosity",
    "will be exalted, and good credit",
    "outlasts death. Caribbean cruises, recipes,",
    "low-interest loans. For you who asked",
    "so much of life, who lived acutely",
    "even in duress, the brimming world",
    "awaits your signature. Cancer and heart disease",
    "are still counting on you for a cure.",
    "B'nai Brith numbers you among the blessed.",
    "They miss you. They want you back."
