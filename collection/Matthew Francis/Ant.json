    "All afternoon a reddish trickle",
    "out of the roots of the beech",
    "and across the lawn,",
    "a sort of rust that shines and dances.",
    "Close up, it proves to be ant,",
    "each droplet a horned",
    "traveler finicking its way round",
    "the crooked geometry",
    "of a grass forest.",
    "A finger felled in their path rocks them,",
    "amazed, back on their haunches.",
    "I see them tasting",
    "the air for subtle intelligence,",
    "till one ventures to scale it,",
    "and others follow.",
    "They are fidgety subjects to draw.",
    "If you sink the feet in glue",
    "the rest twists and writhes;",
    "kill one, the juices evaporate",
    "in seconds, leaving only",
    "the shriveled casing.",
    "I dunked one in brandy. It struggled",
    "till the air rose from its mouth",
    "in pinprick bubbles.",
    "I let it soak an hour, then dried it,",
    "observed the spherical head,",
    "the hairlike feelers,",
    "the grinning vice of its sideways jaw,",
    "the coppery armor plate",
    "with its scattered spines.",
    "Some draft stirred it then. It rose to all",
    "its feet, and set off across",
    "the rough miles of desk."
