    "The grey sea and the long black land;",
    "And the yellow half-moon large and low;",
    "And the startled little waves that leap",
    "In fiery ringlets from their sleep,",
    "As I gain the cove with pushing prow,",
    "And quench its speed i' the slushy sand.",
    "Then a mile of warm sea-scented beach;",
    "Three fields to cross till a farm appears;",
    "A tap at the pane, the quick sharp scratch",
    "And blue spurt of a lighted match,",
    "And a voice less loud, thro' its joys and fears,",
    "Than the two hearts beating each to each!"
