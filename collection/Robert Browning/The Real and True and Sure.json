    "Marriage on earth seems such a counterfeit,",
    "Mere imitation of the inimitable:",
    "In heaven we have the real and true and sure.",
    "\u2019Tis there they neither marry nor are given",
    "In marriage but are as the angels: right,",
    "Oh how right that is, how like Jesus Christ",
    "To say that! Marriage-making for the earth,",
    "With gold so much,\u2014 birth, power, repute so much,",
    "Or beauty, youth so much, in lack of these!",
    "Be as the angels rather, who, apart,",
    "Know themselves into one, are found at length",
    "Married, but marry never, no, nor give",
    "In marriage; they are man and wife at once",
    "When the true time is: here we have to wait",
    "Not so long neither! Could we by a wish",
    "Have what we will and get the future now,",
    "Would we wish aught done undone in the past?",
    "So, let him wait God\u2019s instant men call years;",
    "Meantime hold hard by truth and his great soul,",
    "Do out the duty! Through such souls alone",
    "God stooping shows sufficient of His light",
    "For us i\u2019 the dark to rise by. And I rise."
