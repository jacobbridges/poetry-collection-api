    "Though I do my best I shall scarce succeed.",
    "But what if I fail of my purpose here?",
    "It is but to keep the nerves at strain,",
    "To dry one's eyes and laugh at a fall,",
    "And, baffled, get up and begin again,\u2014",
    "So the chase takes up one's life, that's all.",
    "While, look but once from your farthest bound",
    "At me so deep in the dust and dark,",
    "No sooner the old hope goes to ground",
    "Than a new one, straight to the self-same mark,",
    "I shape me\u2014",
    "Ever",
    "Removed!"
