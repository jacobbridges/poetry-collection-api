    "At the end of the work day",
    "you could tell exactly how far you had gotten",
    "and how much farther there was to go.",
    "Of course, it was just a ditch for a pipeline",
    "to carry the reeking slop",
    "that a neighborhood of toilets",
    "would slosh together to be drained away",
    "but it was clean, the trench,",
    "the slick walls the backhoe bucket cut",
    "and the precise grade of the bottom.",
    "My job was to sight the transit.",
    "I gave a thumbs up or thumbs down",
    "or the OK sign if the pitch was right",
    "so that some future day shit would flow",
    "just as it should, down hill,",
    "but you knew where you stood,",
    "what you had done in a day,",
    "and what more there was to do",
    "and every meaningful thing I had said",
    "I had said without a word."
