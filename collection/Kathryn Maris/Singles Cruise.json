    "each participant simulated detachment but none",
    "was actually single. Some, like the recently widowed,",
    "were attached to ghosts. Others were legally attached",
    "to a living person they once but no longer loved.",
    "A surprising number loved their partners profoundly",
    "while fearing said partners inhabited the category",
    "of those who loved them no longer. These participants,",
    "whose fears may or may not have been founded,",
    "attempted to self-protect by labeling themselves single.",
    "Soon a pattern emerged: those who feared abandonment",
    "developed around them a planetary-like orbit",
    "of potential new partners to whom they could not attach",
    "because they were already attached. Such orbits lasted,",
    "sometimes, for years. The orbiters went to self-help groups",
    "and/or analysts and/or wrote letters to advice columnists.",
    "Because they could not detach from their objects of unrequited",
    "affection, they became the predominant clientele for future",
    "singles cruises, unilaterally sustaining the singles cruise business."
