    "From hedgerows where aromas fain would be",
    "New volleyed odours execrably arise;",
    "The flocks, with hell-smoke in their patient eyes,",
    "Into the ditch from bawling ruin flee:",
    "Spindrift of one abominated sea",
    "Along all roads in wrecking fury flies",
    "Till on young strangled leaf, on bloom that dies,",
    "In this far plot it writes a rune for me.",
    "Vast intimate tyranny! Nature dispossessed",
    "Helplessly hates thee, whose symbolic flare",
    "Lights up (with what reiterance unblest!)",
    "Entrails of horror in a world thought fair.",
    "False God of pastime thou, vampire of rest,",
    "Augur of what pollution, what despair?"
