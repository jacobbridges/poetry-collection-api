    "Between the wet trees and the sorry steeple,",
    "Keep, Time, in dark Soho, what once was Hazlitt,",
    "Seeker of Truth, and finder oft of Beauty;",
    "Beauty\u2019s a sinking light, ah, none too faithful;",
    "But Truth, who leaves so here her spent pursuer,",
    "Forgets not her great pawn: herself shall claim it.",
    "Therefore sleep safe, thou dear and battling spirit,",
    "Safe also on our earth, begetting ever",
    "Some one love worth the ages and the nations!",
    "Nothing falls under thine eyes eternal.",
    "Sleep safe in dark Soho: the stars are shining,",
    "Titian and Woodsworth live; the People marches."
