    "The evenfall, so slow on hills, hath shot",
    "Far down into the valley\u2019s cold extreme,",
    "Untimely midnight; spire and roof and stream",
    "Like fleeing specters, shudder and are not.",
    "The Hampstead hollies, from their sylvan plot",
    "Yet cloudless, lean to watch as in a dream,",
    "From chaos climb with many a sudden gleam,",
    "London, one moment fallen and forgot.",
    "Her booths begin to flare; and gases bright",
    "Prick door and window; all her streets obscure",
    "Sparkle and swarm with nothing true nor sure,",
    "Full as a marsh of mist and winking light;",
    "Heaven thickens over, Heaven that cannot cure",
    "Her tear by day, her fevered smile by night."
