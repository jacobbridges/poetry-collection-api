    "In the dregs of the year, all steam and rain,",
    "In the timid time of the heart again,",
    "When indecision is bold and thorough,",
    "And action dreams of a dawn in vain,",
    "I saw high up over Bloxham vale",
    "The ploughshare tilt to the next long trail,",
    "And, spying a larder in every furrow,",
    "The wagtails crowd like a dancing hail!",
    "A second wonder there on the hill:",
    "Beneath the hedge, I saw with a thrill",
    "The budding primroses laugh good-morrow",
    "From a deep cradle rocked by a rill!",
    "Wagtail smart in his belted blue,",
    "Primrose paying her gold ere due,\u2014",
    "(Out upon Winter! Down with Sorrow!)",
    "These are the things that I know are true."
