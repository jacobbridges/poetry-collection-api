    "Praised be the moon of books! that doth above",
    "A world of men, the fallen Past behold,",
    "And fill the spaces else so void and cold",
    "To make a very heaven again thereof;",
    "As when the sun is set behind a grove,",
    "And faintly unto nether ether rolled,",
    "All night his whiter image and his mould",
    "Grows beautiful with looking on her love.",
    "Thou therefore, moon of so divine a ray,",
    "Lend to our steps both fortitude and light!",
    "Feebly along a venerable way",
    "They climb the infinite, or perish quite;",
    "Nothing are days and deeds to such as they,",
    "While in this liberal house thy face is bright."
