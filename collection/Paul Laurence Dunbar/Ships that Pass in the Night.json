    "Out in the sky the great dark clouds are massing;",
    "I look far out into the pregnant night,",
    "Where I can hear a solemn booming gun",
    "And catch the gleaming of a random light,",
    "That tells me that the ship I seek is passing, passing.",
    "My tearful eyes my soul's deep hurt are glassing;",
    "For I would hail and check that ship of ships.",
    "I stretch my hands imploring, cry aloud,",
    "My voice falls dead a foot from mine own lips,",
    "And but its ghost doth reach that vessel, passing, passing.",
    "O Earth, O Sky, O Ocean, both surpassing,",
    "O heart of mine, O soul that dreads the dark!",
    "Is there no hope for me? Is there no way",
    "That I may sight and check that speeding bark",
    "Which out of sight and sound is passing, passing?"
