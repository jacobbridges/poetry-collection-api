    "We wear the mask that grins and lies,",
    "It hides our cheeks and shades our eyes,\u2014",
    "This debt we pay to human guile;",
    "With torn and bleeding hearts we smile,",
    "And mouth with myriad subtleties.",
    "Why should the world be over-wise,",
    "In counting all our tears and sighs?",
    "Nay, let them only see us, while",
    "We wear the mask.",
    "We smile, but, O great Christ, our cries",
    "To thee from tortured souls arise.",
    "We sing, but oh the clay is vile",
    "Beneath our feet, and long the mile;",
    "But let the world dream otherwise,",
    "We wear the mask!"
