    "Miss A, who graduated six years back,",
    "has air-expressed me an imposing stack",
    "of forms in furtherance of her heart's desire:",
    "a Ph.D. Not wishing to deny her,",
    "I dredge around for something laudatory",
    "to say that won't be simply a tall story;",
    "in fact, I search for memories of her,",
    "and draw a blank\u2014or say, at best a blur.",
    "Was hers the class in that ungodly room",
    "whose creaking door slammed with a sonic boom,",
    "whose radiators twangled for the first",
    "ten minutes, and then hissed, and (this was worst)",
    "subsided with a long, regretful sigh?",
    "Yes, there, as every Wednesday we would try",
    "to overlook cacophony and bring",
    "our wits to bear on some distinguished thing",
    "some poet sometime wrote, Miss A would sit",
    "calm in a middle row and ponder it.",
    "Blonde, I believe, and quiet (so many are).",
    "A dutiful note-taker. Not a star.",
    "Roundheads and Cavaliers received their due",
    "notice from her before the term was through.",
    "She wrote a paper on . . . could it have been",
    "\"Milton's Idea of Original Sin\"?",
    "Or was it \"Deathbed Imagery in Donne\"?",
    "Whichever, it was likely not much fun",
    "for her. It wasn't bad, though I've seen better.",
    "But I can hardly say that in a letter",
    "like this one, now refusing to take shape",
    "even as wispy memories escape",
    "the reach of certitude. Try as I may,",
    "I cannot render palpable Miss A,",
    "who, with five hundred classmates, left few traces",
    "when she decamped. Those mortarboard-crowned faces,",
    "multitudes, beaming, ardent to improve",
    "a world advancing dumbly in its groove,",
    "crossing the stage that day\u2014to be consigned",
    "to a cold-storage portion of the mind . . .",
    "What could be sadder? (She remembered",
    ".)",
    "The transcript says I gave Miss A a B."
