    "And what the cultured word,",
    "Against the undoctored incident",
    "That actually occurred?",
    "Through paint and prose and rhyme\u2014",
    "When Nature in her nakedness",
    "Defeats us every time?",
    "It is not learning, grace nor gear,",
    "Nor easy meat and drink,",
    "But bitter pinch of pain and fear",
    "That makes creation think.",
    "When in this world\u2019s unpleasing youth",
    "Our godlike race began,",
    "The longest arm, the sharpest tooth,",
    "Gave man control of man;",
    "Till, bruised and bitten to the bone",
    "And taught by pain and fear,",
    "He learned to deal the far-off stone,",
    "And poke the long, safe spear.",
    "So tooth and nail were obsolete",
    "As means against a foe,",
    "Till, bored by uniform defeat,",
    "Some genius built the bow.",
    "Then stone and javelin proved as vain",
    "As old-time tooth and nail;",
    "Till, spurred anew by fear and pain,",
    "Man fashioned coats of mail.",
    "Then was there safety for the rich",
    "And danger for the poor,",
    "Till someone mixed a powder which",
    "Redressed the scale once more.",
    "Helmet and armour disappeared",
    "With sword and bow and pike,",
    "And, when the smoke of battle cleared,",
    "All men were armed alike. . . .",
    "And when ten million such were slain",
    "To please one crazy king,",
    "Man, schooled in bulk by fear and pain,",
    "Grew weary of the thing;",
    "And, at the very hour designed",
    "To enslave him past recall,",
    "His tooth-stone-arrow-gun-shy mind",
    "Turned and abolished all.",
    "Whose head has grown too large,",
    "Ends by destroying its own job",
    "And works its own discharge;",
    "And Man, whose mere necessities",
    "Move all things from his path,",
    "Trembles meanwhile at their decrees,",
    "And deprecates their wrath!"
