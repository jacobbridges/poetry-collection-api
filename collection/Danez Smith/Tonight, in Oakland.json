    "I did not come here to sing a blues.",
    "Lately, I open my mouth",
    "& out comes marigolds, yellow plums.",
    "I came to make the sky a garden.",
    "Give me rain or give me honey, dear lord.",
    "The sky has given us no water this year.",
    "I ride my bike to a boy, when I get there",
    "what we make will not be beautiful",
    "or love at all, but it will be deserved.",
    "I\u2019ve started seeking men to wet the harvest.",
    "Come, tonight I declare we must move",
    "instead of pray. Tonight, east of here,",
    "two boys, one dressed in what could be blood",
    "& one dressed in what could be blood",
    "before the wound, meet & mean mug",
    "& God, tonight, let them dance! Tonight,",
    "the bullet does not exist. Tonight, the police",
    "have turned to their God for forgiveness.",
    "Tonight, we bury nothing, we serve a God",
    "with no need for shovels, we serve a God",
    "with a bad hip & a brother in prison.",
    "Tonight, let every man be his own lord.",
    "Let wherever two people stand be a reunion",
    "of ancient lights. Let\u2019s waste the moon\u2019s marble glow",
    "shouting our names to the stars until we are",
    "the stars. O, precious God! O, sweet black town!",
    "I am drunk & I thirst. When I get to the boy",
    "who lets me practice hunger with him",
    "I will not give him the name of your newest ghost",
    "I will give him my body & what he does with it",
    "is none of my business, but I will say",
    "& he will say",
    "& tonight, when we dream, we dream of dancing",
    "in a city slowly becoming ash."
