    "After the trumpets, after the incense",
    "There were nights insomnia fathered gods",
    "I then rejected as too angry or distracted,",
    "Or whose appetite for submission revealed",
    "Their own lack of faith.",
    "Others spoke",
    "In sugared paradox:",
    "All. To not know all is not to know. To know",
    "All requires that you know very little,",
    "But to know that little you have to know",
    "All . And for a while, it's true,",
    "I burned in the dark fires of ambivalence,",
    "My attention consumed like oxygen.",
    "I'd wake up tired, as I had with the married man",
    "Whose strictures and caprice begat,",
    "And begat, and begat, and begat",
    "My love for him, harvesting the same",
    "Silence from my bed. Who listens",
    "To my penitential tune? Who accepts",
    "My petitions for convenient parking,",
    "For spring, for the self illuminated",
    "Across a kitchen table, for . . . for",
    "Fortitude? I've heard a voice, I'm sure,",
    "Advising me to drop this sentimental farce.",
    "Only to hold the smoke of their names",
    "Again in my mouth I'd resurrect",
    "The dead, or adopt the gods orphaned",
    "By atheists, except the gods they've made",
    "From disbelief no one's faith could tolerate.",
    "Refusing to make the same mistake",
    "Just once, I've cried out to the dark",
    "Many names, most given up as routinely",
    "As the secrets of friends. If you're a cup",
    "Will my lips profane your own? If a comb",
    "Will I feel your teeth against my neck?",
    "If a wall I will be darker than your shadow.",
    "And if a door I will unlatch you, letting in",
    "All the little foxes from the vineyard."
