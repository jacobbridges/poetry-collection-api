    "Unfastened avidly from each ivory button",
    "of her spine, the voluntary muscles open",

    "the mutagen, and carmine from cochineal",
    "born between fog and frost, so many little",
    "deaths Buddhists refuse to wear",
    "robes soaked in its thousands. Sunsets",
    "of other centuries fade in galleries to ash.",
    "Red is fugitive: As the voice, the blow",
    "of gravity along a nerve opening to an ache",
    "the body can\u2019t unhouse: As the carnation",
    "suffusing cheek and haunch like saucers",
    "from the king\u2019s porcelain rinsed in candlelight.",
    "Gratuitous as the curl, the urn-shaped torso,",
    "the pensive, brimming gaze of pretty",
    "post-coital thought she half-turns over one",
    "excavated shoulder. As if to see herself",
    "in a mirror\u2019s savage theater as elegy",
    "to the attempt to fill an exhausted form,",
    "to learn again the old ordeals of wound",
    "and hand and eye. To find the source of burning."
