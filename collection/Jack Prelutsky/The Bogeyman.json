    "In the desolate depths of a perilous place",
    "the bogeyman lurks, with a snarl on his face.",
    "Never dare, never dare to approach his dark lair",
    "for he's waiting . . . just waiting . . . to get you.",
    "He skulks in the shadows, relentless and wild",
    "in his search for a tender, delectable child.",
    "With his steely sharp claws and his slavering jaws",
    "oh he's waiting . . . just waiting . . . to get you.",
    "Many have entered his dreary domain",
    "but not even one has been heard from again.",
    "They no doubt made a feast for the butchering beast",
    "and he's waiting . . . just waiting . . . to get you.",
    "In that sulphurous, sunless and sinister place",
    "he'll crumple your bones in his bogey embrace.",
    "Never never go near if you hold your life dear,",
    "for oh! . . . what he'll do . . . when he gets you!"
