    "I wave good-bye when butter flies",
    "and cheer a boxing match,",
    "I've often watched my pillow fight,",
    "I've sewn a cabbage patch,",
    "I like to dance at basket balls",
    "or lead a rubber band,",
    "I've marvelled at a spelling bee,",
    "I've helped a peanut stand.",
    "It's possible a pencil points,",
    "but does a lemon drop?",
    "Does coffee break or chocolate kiss,",
    "and will a soda pop?",
    "I share my milk with drinking straws,",
    "my meals with chewing gum,",
    "and should I see my pocket change,",
    "I'll hear my kettle drum.",
    "It makes me sad when lettuce leaves,",
    "I laugh when dinner rolls,",
    "I wonder if the kitchen sinks",
    "and if a salad bowls,",
    "I've listened to a diamond ring,",
    "I've waved a football fan,",
    "and if a chimney sweeps the floor,",
    "I'm sure the garbage can."
