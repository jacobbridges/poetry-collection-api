    "Methinks 'tis pretty sport to hear a child,",
    "Rocking a word in mouth yet undefiled.",
    "The tender racket rudely plays the sound,",
    "Which weakly banded cannot back rebound,",
    "And the soft air the softer roof does kiss,",
    "With a sweet dying and a pretty miss,",
    "Which hears no answer yet from the white rank",
    "Of teeth, not risen from their coral bank.",
    "The alphabet is searched for letters soft,",
    "To try a word before it can be wrought,",
    "And when it slides forth, it goes as nice,",
    "As when a man does walk upon the ice.",
