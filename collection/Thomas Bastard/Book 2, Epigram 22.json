    "I met a courtier riding on the plain,",
    "Well-mounted on a brave and gallant steed;",
    "I sat upon a jade, and spurred to my pain",
    "My lazy beast, whose tired sides did bleed:",
    "He saw my case, and then of courtesy",
    "Did rein his horse, and drew the bridle in,",
    "Because I did desire his company:",
    "But he corvetting way of me did win.",
    "What should I do, who was besteaded so?",
    "His horse stood still faster than mine could go.",
