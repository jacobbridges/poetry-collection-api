    "i",
    "The children on the lawn",
    "joined hand to hand",
    "go round and round",
    "each arm going into",
    "the next arm, around",
    "full circle",
    "until it comes",
    "back into each of the single",
    "bodies again",
    "They are singing, but",
    "not to each other:",
    "their feet move",
    "almost in time to the singing",
    "We can see",
    "the concentration on",
    "their faces, their eyes",
    "fixed on the empty",
    "moving spaces just in",
    "front of them.",
    "We might mistake this",
    "tranced moving for joy",
    "but there is no joy in it",
    "We can see (arm in arm)",
    "as we watch them go",
    "round and round",
    "intent, almost",
    "studious (the grass",
    "underfoot ignored, the trees",
    "circling the lawn",
    "ignored, the lake ignored)",
    "that the whole point",
    "for them",
    "of going round and round",
    "is (faster",
    "slower)",
    "going round and round",
    "ii",
    "Being with you",
    "here, in this room",
    "is like groping through a mirror",
    "whose glass has melted",
    "to the consistency",
    "of gelatin",
    "You refuse to be",
    "(and I)",
    "an exact reflection, yet",
    "will not walk from the glass,",
    "be separate.",
    "Anyway, it is right",
    "that they have put",
    "so many mirrors here",
    "(chipped, hung crooked)",
    "in this room with its high transom",
    "and empty wardrobe; even",
    "the back of the door",
    "has one.",
    "There are people in the next room",
    "arguing, opening and closing drawers",
    "(the walls are thin)",
    "You look past me, listening",
    "to them, perhaps, or",
    "watching",
    "your own reflection somewhere",
    "behind my head,",
    "over my shoulder",
    "You shift, and the bed",
    "sags under us, losing its focus",
    "there is someone in the next room",
    "there is always",
    "(your face",
    "remote, listening)",
    "someone in the next room.",
    "iii",
    "However,",
    "in all their games",
    "there seems",
    "to be some reason",
    "however",
    "abstract they",
    "at first appear",
    "When we read them legends",
    "in the evening",
    "of monstrous battles, and secret",
    "betrayals in the forest",
    "and brutal deaths,",
    "they scarcely listened;",
    "one yawned and fidgeted; another",
    "chewed the wooden handle",
    "of a hammer;",
    "the youngest one examined",
    "a slight cut on his toe,",
    "and we wondered how",
    "they could remain",
    "completely without fear",
    "or even interest",
    "as the final sword slid through",
    "the dying hero.",
    "The next night",
    "walking along the beach",
    "we found the trenches",
    "they had been making:",
    "fortified with pointed sticks",
    "driven into the sides",
    "of their sand moats",
    "and a lake-enclosed island",
    "with no bridges:",
    "a last attempt",
    "(however",
    "eroded by the water",
    "in an hour)",
    "to make",
    "maybe, a refuge human",
    "and secure from the reach",
    "of whatever walks along",
    "(sword hearted)",
    "these night beaches.",
    "iv",
    "Returning to the room:",
    "I notice how",
    "all your word-",
    "plays, calculated ploys",
    "of the body, the witticisms",
    "of touch, are now",
    "attempts to keep me",
    "at a certain distance",
    "and (at length) avoid",
    "admitting I am here",
    "I watch you",
    "watching my face",
    "indifferently",
    "yet with the same taut curiosity",
    "with which you might regard",
    "a suddenly discovered part",
    "of your own body:",
    "a wart perhaps,",
    "and I remember that",
    "you said",
    "in childhood you were",
    "a tracer of maps",
    "(not making but) moving",
    "a pen or a forefinger",
    "over the courses of the rivers,",
    "the different colours",
    "that mark the rise of mountains;",
    "a memorizer",
    "of names (to hold",
    "these places",
    "in their proper places)",
    "So now you trace me",
    "like a country\u2019s boundary",
    "or a strange new wrinkle in",
    "your own wellknown skin",
    "and I am fixed, stuck",
    "down on the outspread map",
    "of this room, of your mind\u2019s continent",
    "(here and yet not here, like",
    "the wardrobe and the mirrors",
    "the voices through the wall",
    "your body ignored on the bed),",
    "transfixed",
    "by your eyes\u2019",
    "cold blue thumbtacks",
    "v",
    "The children like the block",
    "of grey stone that was once a fort",
    "but now is a museum:",
    "especially",
    "they like the guns",
    "and the armour brought from",
    "other times and countries",
    "and when they go home",
    "their drawings will be full",
    "for some days, of swords",
    "archaic sunburst maces",
    "broken spears",
    "and vivid red explosions.",
    "While they explore",
    "the cannons",
    "(they aren\u2019t our children)",
    "we walk outside along",
    "the earthworks, noting",
    "how they are crumbling",
    "under the unceasing",
    "attacks of feet and flower roots;",
    "The weapons",
    "that were once outside",
    "sharpening themselves on war",
    "are now indoors",
    "there, in the fortress,",
    "fragile",
    "in glass cases;",
    "Why is it",
    "(I\u2019m thinking",
    "of the careful moulding",
    "round the stonework archways)",
    "that in this time, such",
    "elaborate defences keep",
    "things that are no longer",
    "(much)",
    "worth defending?",
    "vi",
    "And you play the safe game",
    "the orphan game",
    "the ragged winter game",
    "that says, I am alone",
    "(hungry: I know you want me",
    "to play it also)",
    "the game of the waif who stands",
    "at every picture window,",
    "shivering, pinched nose pressed",
    "against the glass, the snow",
    "collecting on his neck,",
    "watching the happy families",
    "(a game of envy)",
    "Yet he despises them: they are so",
    "Victorian Christmas-card:",
    "the cheap paper shows",
    "under the pigments of",
    "their cheerful fire-",
    "places and satin-",
    "ribboned suburban laughter",
    "and they have their own forms",
    "of parlour",
    "games: father and mother",
    "playing father and mother",
    "He\u2019s glad",
    "to be left",
    "out by himself",
    "in the cold",

    "When I tell you this,",
    "you say (with a smile fake",
    "as a tinsel icicle):",
    "You do it too.",
    "Which in some ways",
    "is a lie, but also I suppose",
    "is right, as usual:",

    "This casual bed",
    "scruffy as dry turf,",
    "the counterpane",
    "rumpled with small burrows, is",
    "their grassy lawn",
    "and these scuffed walls",
    "contain their circling trees,",
    "that low clogged sink",
    "their lake",
    "(a wasp comes,",
    "drawn by the piece of sandwich",
    "left on the nearby beach",
    "(how carefully you do",
    "such details);",
    "one of the children flinches",
    "but won\u2019t let go)",
    "You make them",
    "turn and turn, according to",
    "the closed rules of your games,",
    "but there is no joy in it",
    "and as we lie",
    "arm in arm, neither",
    "joined nor separate",
    "(your observations change me",
    "to a spineless woman in",
    "a cage of bones, obsolete fort",
    "pulled inside out),",
    "our lips moving",
    "almost in time to their singing,",
    "listening to the opening",
    "and closing of the drawers",
    "in the next room",
    "(of course there is always",
    "danger but where",
    "would you locate it)",
    "(the children spin",
    "a round cage of glass",
    "from the warm air",
    "with their thread-thin",
    "insect voices)",
    "and as we lie",
    "here, caught",
    "in the monotony of wandering",
    "from room to room, shifting",
    "the place of our defences,",
    "I want to break",
    "these bones, your prisoning rhythms",
    "(winter,",
    "summer)",
    "all the glass cases,",
