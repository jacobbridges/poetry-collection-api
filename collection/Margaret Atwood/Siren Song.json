    "This is the one song everyone",
    "would like to learn: the song",
    "that is irresistible:",
    "the song that forces men",
    "to leap overboard in squadrons",
    "even though they see the beached skulls",
    "the song nobody knows",
    "because anyone who has heard it",
    "is dead, and the others can't remember.",
    "Shall I tell you the secret",
    "and if I do, will you get me",
    "out of this bird suit?",
    "I don't enjoy it here",
    "squatting on this island",
    "looking picturesque and mythical",
    "with these two feathery maniacs,",
    "I don't enjoy singing",
    "this trio, fatal and valuable.",
    "I will tell the secret to you,",
    "to you, only to you.",
    "Come closer. This song",
    "is a cry for help: Help me!",
    "Only you, only you can,",
    "you are unique",
    "at last. Alas",
    "it is a boring song",
    "but it works every time."
