    "In restaurants we argue",
    "over which of us will pay for your funeral",
    "though the real question is",
    "whether or not I will make you immortal.",
    "At the moment only I",
    "can do it and so",
    "I raise the magic fork",
    "over the plate of beef fried rice",
    "and plunge it into your heart.",
    "There is a faint pop, a sizzle",
    "and through your own split head",
    "you rise up glowing;",
    "the ceiling opens",
    "a voice sings Love Is A Many",
    "Splendoured Thing",
    "you hang suspended above the city",
    "in blue tights and a red cape,",
    "your eyes flashing in unison.",
    "The other diners regard you",
    "some with awe, some only with bordom:",
    "they cannot decide if you are a new weapon",
    "or only a new advertisement.",
    "As for me, I continue eating;",
    "I liked you better the way you were,",
    "but you were always ambitious."
