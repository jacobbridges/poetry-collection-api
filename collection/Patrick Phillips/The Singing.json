    "I can hear her through",
    "the thin wall, singing,",
    "up before the sun:",
    "two notes, a kind",
    "of hushed half-breathing,",
    "each time the baby",
    "makes that little moan\u2014",
    "can hear her trying",
    "not to sing, then singing",
    "anyway, a thing so old",
    "it might as well",
    "be Hittite or Minoan,",
    "and so soft no one",
    "would ever guess",
    "that I myself once",
    "sang that very song:",
    "back when my son",
    "and then his brother",
    "used to cry all night",
    "or half the morning,",
    "though nothing in all",
    "the world was wrong.",
    "And now how strange:",
    "to be the man from next door,",
    "listening, as the baby cries",
    "then quiets, cries and quiets",
    "each time she sings",
    "their secret song,",
    "that would sound the same ten",
    "thousand years ago,",
    "and has no",
    "meaning but to calm."
