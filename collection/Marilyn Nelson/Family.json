    "the stairs with the Irish servants, who hated me",
    "for the fatal flaw in my genealogy.",
    "For the first time in my life I am at home",
    "in this bevy of scholars, my first family.",
    "Here, the wallpapers welcome me into every room,",
    "and the mirrors see me, not my pedigree.",
    "My sisters, Jerusha, Emilia, Elizabeth ...",
    "But Mama's unlettered silence is a death."
