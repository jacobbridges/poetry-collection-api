    "I have no answer to the blank inequity",
    "of a four-year-old dying of cancer.",
    "I saw her on t.v. and wept",
    "with my mouth full of meatloaf.",
    "I constantly flash on disasters now;",
    "red lights shout",
    ".",
    ".",
    "everywhere I look.",
    "I buckle him in, but what if a car",
    "with a grille like a sharkbite",
    "roared up out of the road?",
    "I feed him square meals",
    "but what if the fist of his heart",
    "should simply fall open?",
    "I carried him safely",
    "as long as I could,",
    "but now he's a runaway",
    "on the dangerous highway.",
    ".",
    "I've started to pray.",
    "But the dangerous highway",
    "curves through blue evenings",
    "when I hold his yielding hand",
    "and snip his miniscule nails",
    "with my vicious-looking scissors.",
    "I carry him around",
    "like an egg in a spoon,",
    "and I remember a porcelain fawn,",
    "a best friend's trust,",
    "my broken faith in myself.",
    "It's not my grace that keeps me erect",
    "as the sidewalk clatters downhill",
    "under my rollerskate wheels.",
    "Sometimes I lie awake",
    "troubled by this thought:",
    "It's not so simple to give a child birth;",
    "you also have to give it death,",
    "the jealous fairy's christening gift.",
    "I've always pictured my own death",
    "as a closed door,",
    "a black room,",
    "a breathless leap from the mountain top",
    "with time to throw out my arms, lift my head,",
    "and see, in the instant my heart stops,",
    "a whole galaxy of blue.",
    "I imagined I'd forget,",
    "in the cessation of feeling,",
    "while the guilt of my lifetime floated away",
    "like a nylon nightgown,",
    "and that I'd fall into clean, fresh forgiveness.",
    "Ah, but the death I've given away",
    "is more mine than the one I've kept:",
    "from my hand the poisoned apple,",
    "from my bow the mistletoe dart.",
    "Then I think of Mama,",
    "her bountiful breasts.",
    "When I was a child, I really swear,",
    "Mama's kisses could heal.",
    "I remember her promise,",
    "and whisper it over my sweet son's sleep:"
