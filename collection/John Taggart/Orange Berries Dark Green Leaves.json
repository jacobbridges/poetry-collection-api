    "Darkened not completely dark let us walk in the darkened field",
    "trees in the field outlined against that which is less dark",
    "under the trees are bushes with orange berries dark green leaves",
    "not poetry\u2019\ufeff\ufeffs mixing of yellow light blue sky darker than that",
    "darkness of the leaves a modulation of the accumulated darkness",
    "orange of the berries another modulation spreading out toward us",
    "it is like the reverberation of a bell rung three times",
    "like the call of a voice the call of a voice that is not there.",
    "We will not look up how they got their name in a book of names",
    "we will not trace the name\u2019\ufeff\ufeffs root conjecture its first murmuring",
    "the root of the berries their leaves is succoured by darkness",
    "darkness like a large block of stone hauled on a wooden sled",
    "like stone formed and reformed by a dark sea rolling in turmoil."
