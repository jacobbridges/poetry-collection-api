    "Shall I say how it is in your clothes?",
    "A month after your death I wear your blue jacket.",
    "The dog at the center of my life recognizes",
    "you\u2019ve come to visit, he\u2019s ecstatic.",
    "In the left pocket, a hole.",
    "In the right, a parking ticket",
    "delivered up last August on Bay State Road.",
    "In my heart, a scatter like milkweed,",
    "a flinging from the pods of the soul.",
    "My skin presses your old outline.",
    "It is hot and dry inside.",
    "I think of the last day of your life,",
    "old friend, how I would unwind it, paste",
    "it together in a different collage,",
    "back from the death car idling in the garage,",
    "back up the stairs, your praying hands unlaced,",
    "reassembling the bits of bread and tuna fish",
    "into a ceremony of sandwich,",
    "running the home movie backward to a space",
    "we could be easy in, a kitchen place",
    "with vodka and ice, our words like living meat.",
    "Dear friend, you have excited crowds",
    "with your example. They swell",
    "like wine bags, straining at your seams.",
    "I will be years gathering up our words,",
    "fishing out letters, snapshots, stains,",
    "leaning my ribs against this durable cloth",
    "to put on the dumb blue blazer of your death."
