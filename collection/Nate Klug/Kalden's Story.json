    "So won a name in this place,",
    "handing off lath strips to a hammer's",
    "measure, seeing the passing girls' slits",
    "in roils of timber grain.",
    "Mountains, barley, scaffold,",
    "dirt. I was sixteen. And hourly",
    "from the hoods of faraway bells",
    "monks emerging like hairless animals.",
    "I was sixteen. What did I know",
    "of sovereignty, or the new soldiers",
    "by the gate, chinning their shotguns",
    "like violins? Nights, a tin roof",
    "wind cracked flat; my sister,",
    "flushed with child, hushing a child."
