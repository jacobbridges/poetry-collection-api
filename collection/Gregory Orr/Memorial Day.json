    "After our march from the Hudson to the top",
    "of Cemetery Hill, we Boy Scouts proudly endured",
    "the sermons and hot sun while Girl Scouts",
    "lolled among graves in the maple shade.",
    "When members of the veterans\u2019 honor guard",
    "aimed their bone-white rifles skyward and fired,",
    "I glimpsed beneath one metal helmet",
    "the salmon-pink flesh of Mr. Webber\u2019s nose,",
    "restored after shrapnel tore it.",
    "2",
    "Friends who sat near me in school died in Asia,",
    "now lie here under new stones that small flags flap",
    "beside.",
    "It\u2019s fifth-grade recess: war stories.",
    "Mr. Webber stands before us and plucks",
    "his glass eye from its socket, holds it high",
    "between finger and thumb. The girls giggle",
    "and scream; the awed boys gape. The fancy pocket watch",
    "he looted from a shop in Germany",
    "ticks on its chain."
