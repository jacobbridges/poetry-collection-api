    "Calm was the even, and clear was the sky,",
    "And the new budding flowers did spring,",
    "When all alone went Amyntas and I",
    "To hear the sweet nightingale sing;",
    "I sate, and he laid him down by me;",
    "But scarcely his breath he could draw;",
    "For when with a fear, he began to draw near,",
    "He was dash'd with A ha ha ha ha!",
    "He blush'd to himself, and lay still for a while,",
    "And his modesty curb'd his desire;",
    "But straight I convinc'd all his fear with a smile,",
    "Which added new flames to his fire.",
    "O Silvia, said he, you are cruel,",
    "To keep your poor lover in awe;",
    "Then once more he press'd with his hand to my breast,",
    "But was dash'd with A ha ha ha ha!",
    "I knew 'twas his passion that caus'd all his fear;",
    "And therefore I pitied his case:",
    "I whisper'd him softly, there's nobody near,",
    "And laid my cheek close to his face:",
    "But as he grew bolder and bolder,",
    "A shepherd came by us and saw;",
    "And just as our bliss we began with a kiss,",
    "He laugh'd out with A ha ha ha ha!"
