    "Creator Spirit, by whose aid",
    "The world's foundations first were laid,",
    "Come, visit ev'ry pious mind;",
    "Come, pour thy joys on human kind;",
    "From sin, and sorrow set us free;",
    "And make thy temples worthy Thee.",
    "O, Source of uncreated Light,",
    "The Father's promis'd Paraclete!",
    "Thrice Holy Fount, thrice Holy Fire,",
    "Our hearts with heav'nly love inspire;",
    "Come, and thy Sacred Unction bring",
    "To sanctify us, while we sing!",
    "Plenteous of grace, descend from high,",
    "Rich in thy sev'n-fold energy!",
    "Thou strength of his Almighty Hand,",
    "Whose pow'r does heav'n and earth command:",
    "Proceeding Spirit, our Defence,",
    "Who do'st the gift of tongues dispence,",
    "And crown'st thy gift with eloquence!",
    "Refine and purge our earthly parts;",
    "But, oh, inflame and fire our hearts!",
    "Our frailties help, our vice control;",
    "Submit the senses to the soul;",
    "And when rebellious they are grown,",
    "Then, lay thy hand, and hold 'em down.",
    "Chase from our minds th' Infernal Foe;",
    "And peace, the fruit of love, bestow;",
    "And, lest our feet should step astray,",
    "Protect, and guide us in the way.",
    "Make us Eternal Truths receive,",
    "And practise, all that we believe:",
    "Give us thy self, that we may see",
    "The Father and the Son, by thee.",
    "Immortal honour, endless fame,",
    "Attend th' Almighty Father's name:",
    "The Saviour Son be glorified,",
    "Who for lost Man's redemption died:",
    "And equal adoration be,",
    "Eternal Paraclete, to thee."
