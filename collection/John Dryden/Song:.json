    "Fair Iris I love and hourly I die,",
    "But not for a lip nor a languishing eye:",
    "She's fickle and false, and there I agree;",
    "For I am as false and as fickle as she:",
    "We neither believe what either can say;",
    "And, neither believing, we neither betray.",
    "'Tis civil to swear and say things, of course;",
    "We mean not the taking for better or worse.",
    "When present we love, when absent agree;",
    "I think not of Iris, nor Iris of me:",
    "The legend of love no couple can find",
    "So easy to part, or so equally join'd."
