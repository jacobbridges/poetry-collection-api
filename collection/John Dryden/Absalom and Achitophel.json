    "In pious times, ere priest-craft did begin,",
    "Before polygamy was made a sin;",
    "When man, on many, multipli'd his kind,",
    "Ere one to one was cursedly confin'd:",
    "When Nature prompted, and no Law deni'd",
    "Promiscuous use of concubine and bride;",
    "Then, Israel's monarch, after Heaven's own heart,",
    "His vigorous warmth did variously impart",
    "To wives and slaves: and, wide as his command,",
    "Scatter'd his Maker's image through the land.",
    "Michal, of royal blood, the crown did wear;",
    "A soil ungrateful to the tiller's care:",
    "Not so the rest; for several mothers bore",
    "To god-like David, several sons before.",
    "But since like slaves his bed they did ascend,",
    "No true succession could their seed attend.",
    "Of all this numerous progeny was none",
    "So beautiful, so brave, as Absalom:",
    "Whether, inspir'd by some diviner lust,",
    "His father got him with a greater gust;",
    "Or that his conscious destiny made way,",
    "By manly beauty to imperial sway.",
    "Early in foreign fields he won renown,",
    "With kings and states alli'd to Israel's crown:",
    "In peace the thoughts of war he could remove,",
    "And seem'd as he were only born for love.",
    "Whate'er he did, was done with so much ease,",
    "In him alone, 'twas natural to please:",
    "His motions all accompani'd with grace;",
    "And Paradise was open'd in his face.",
    "With secret joy, indulgent David view'd",
    "His youthful image in his son renew'd:",
    "To all his wishes nothing he deni'd;",
    "And made the charming Annabel his bride.",
    "What faults he had (for who from faults is free?)",
    "His father could not, or he would not see.",
    "Some warm excesses, which the Law forbore,",
    "Were constru'd youth that purged by boiling o'er:",
    "And Amnon's murther, by a specious name,",
    "Was call'd a just revenge for injur'd fame.",
    "Thus prais'd, and lov'd, the noble youth remain'd,",
    "While David, undisturb'd, in Sion reign'd.",
    "But life can never be sincerely blest:",
    "Heav'n punishes the bad, and proves the best.",
    "The Jews, a headstrong, moody, murm'ring race,",
    "As ever tri'd th'extent and stretch of grace;",
    "God's pamper'd people whom, debauch'd with ease,",
    "No king could govern, nor no God could please;",
    "(Gods they had tri'd of every shape and size,",
    "That god-smiths could produce, or priests devise:)",
    "These Adam-wits, too fortunately free,",
    "Began to dream they wanted liberty:",
    "And when no rule, no precedent, was found",
    "Of men, by laws less circumscrib'd and bound,",
    "They led their wild desires to woods and caves,",
    "And thought that all but savages were slaves.",
    "They who, when Saul was dead, without a blow,",
    "Made foolish Ishbosheth the crown forego;",
    "Who banisht David did from Hebron bring,",
    "And, with a general shout, proclaim'd him king:",
    "Those very Jews, who, at their very best,",
    "Their Humour more than loyalty exprest,",
    "Now, wonder'd why, so long, they had obey'd",
    "An idol-monarch which their hands had made:",
    "Thought they might ruin him they could create;",
    "Or melt him to that golden calf, a state.",
    "But these were random bolts: no form'd design,",
    "Nor interest made the factious crowd to join:",
    "The sober part of Israel, free from stain,",
    "Well knew the value of a peaceful reign:",
    "And, looking backward with a wise afright,",
    "Saw seams of wounds, dishonest to the sight:",
    "In contemplation of whose ugly scars,",
    "They curst the memory of civil wars.",
    "The moderate sort of men, thus qualifi'd,",
    "Inclin'd the balance to the better side:",
    "And, David's mildness manag'd it so well,",
    "The bad found no occasion to rebel.",
    "But, when to sin our bias'd nature leans,",
    "The careful Devil is still at hand with means;",
    "And providently pimps for ill desires:",
    "The good old cause reviv'd, a plot requires.",
    "Plots, true or false, are necessary things,",
    "To raise up common-wealths, and ruin kings.",
    "Th' inhabitants of old Jerusalem",
    "Were Jebusites: the town so call'd from them;",
    "And theirs the native right\u2014",
    "But when the chosen people grew more strong,",
    "The rightful cause at length became the wrong:",
    "And every loss the men of Jebus bore,",
    "They still were thought God's enemies the more.",
    "Thus, worn and weaken'd, well or ill content,",
    "Submit they must to David's government:",
    "Impoverish'd and depriv'd of all command,",
    "Their taxes doubled as they lost their land;",
    "And, what was harder yet to flesh and blood,",
    "Their gods disgrac'd, and burnt like common wood.",
    "This set the heathen priesthood in a flame;",
    "For priests of all religions are the same:",
    "Of whatsoe'er descent their godhead be,",
    "Stock, stone, or other homely pedigree,",
    "In his defence his servants are as bold,",
    "As if he had been born of beaten gold.",
    "The Jewish Rabbins though their Enemies,",
    "In this conclude them honest men and wise:",
    "For 'twas their duty, all the learned think,",
    "T'espouse his cause by whom they eat and drink.",
    "From hence began that plot, the nation's curse,",
    "Bad in itself, but represented worse.",
    "Rais'd in extremes, and in extremes decri'd;",
    "With oaths affirm'd, with dying vows deni'd.",
    "Not weigh'd, or winnow'd by the multitude;",
    "But swallow'd in the mass, unchew'd and crude.",
    "Some truth there was, but dash'd and brew'd with lies;",
    "To please the fools, and puzzle all the wise.",
    "Succeeding times did equal folly call,",
    "Believing nothing, or believing all.",
    "Th' Egyptian rites the Jebusites embrac'd;",
    "Where gods were recommended by their taste.",
    "Such sav'ry deities must needs be good,",
    "As serv'd at once for worship and for food.",
    "By force they could not introduce these gods;",
    "For ten to one, in former days was odds.",
    "So fraud was us'd, (the sacrificers' trade,)",
    "Fools are more hard to conquer than persuade.",
    "Their busy teachers mingled with the Jews;",
    "And rak'd, for converts, even the court and stews:",
    "Which Hebrew priests the more unkindly took,",
    "Because the fleece accompanies the flock.",
    "Some thought they God's anointed meant to slay",
    "By guns, invented since full many a day:",
    "Our author swears it not; but who can know",
    "How far the Devil and Jebusites may go?",
    "This plot, which fail'd for want of common sense,",
    "Had yet a deep and dangerous consequence:",
    "For, as when raging fevers boil the blood,",
    "The standing lake soon floats into a flood;",
    "And ev'ry hostile humour, which before",
    "Slept quiet in its channels, bubbles o'er:",
    "So, several factions from this first ferment,",
    "Work up to foam, and threat the government.",
    "Some by their friends, more by themselves thought wise,",
    "Oppos'd the pow'r, to which they could not rise.",
    "Some had in courts been great, and thrown from thence,",
    "Like fiends, were harden'd in impenitence.",
    "Some by their monarch's fatal mercy grown,",
    "From pardon'd rebels, kinsmen to the throne;",
    "Were rais'd in pow'r and public office high;",
    "Strong bands, if bands ungrateful men could tie.",
    "Of these the false Achitophel was first:",
    "A name to all succeeding ages curst.",
    "For close designs, and crooked counsels fit;",
    "Sagacious, bold and turbulent of wit:",
    "Restless, unfixt in principles and place;",
    "In pow'r unpleas'd, impatient of disgrace.",
    "A fiery soul, which working out its way,",
    "Fretted the pigmy-body to decay:",
    "And o'er inform'd the tenement of clay.",
    "A daring pilot in extremity;",
    "Pleas'd with the danger, when the waves went high",
    "He sought the storms; but for a calm unfit,",
    "Would steer too nigh the sands, to boast his wit.",
    "Great wits are sure to madness near alli'd;",
    "And thin partitions do their bounds divide:",
    "Else, why should he, with wealth and honour blest,",
    "Refuse his age the needful hours of rest?",
    "Punish a body which he could not please;",
    "Bankrupt of life, yet prodigal of ease?",
    "And all to leave, what with his toil he won",
    "To that unfeather'd, two-legg'd thing, a son:",
    "Got, while his soul did huddled notions try;",
    "And born a shapeless lump, like anarchy.",
    "In friendship false, implacable in hate:",
    "Resolv'd to ruin or to rule the state.",
    "To compass this, the triple bond he broke;",
    "The pillars of the public safety shook:",
    "And fitted Israel for a foreign yoke.",
    "Then, seiz'd with fear, yet still affecting fame,",
    "Usurp'd a patriot's all-atoning name.",
    "So easy still it proves in factious times,",
    "With public zeal to cancel private crimes:",
    "How safe is treason, and how sacred ill,",
    "Where none can sin against the people's will:",
    "Where crowds can wink; and no offence be known,",
    "Since in another's guilt they find their own.",
    "Yet, fame deserv'd, no enemy can grudge;",
    "The statesman we abhor, but praise the judge.",
    "In Jewish courts ne'er sat an Abbethdin",
    "With more discerning eyes, or hands more clean:",
    "Unbrib'd, unsought, the wretched to redress;",
    "Swift of dispatch, and easy of access.",
    "Oh, had he been content to serve the crown,",
    "With virtues only proper to the gown;",
    "Or, had the rankness of the soil been freed",
    "From cockle, that opprest the noble seed:",
    "David, for him his tuneful harp had strung,",
    "And heav'n had wanted one immortal song.",
    "But wild ambition loves to slide, not stand;",
    "And fortune's ice prefers to virtue's land:",
    "Achitophel, grown weary to possess",
    "A lawful fame, and lazy happiness;",
    "Disdain'd the golden fruit to gather free,",
    "And lent the crowd his arm to shake the tree.",
    "Now, manifest of crimes, contriv'd long since,",
    "He stood at bold defiance with his prince:",
    "Held up the buckler of the people's cause,",
    "Against the crown; and skulk'd behind the laws.",
    "The wish'd occasion of the plot he takes;",
    "Some circumstances finds, but more he makes.",
    "By buzzing emissaries, fills the ears",
    "Of list'ning crowds, with jealousies and fears",
    "Of arbitrary counsels brought to light,",
    "And proves the king himself a Jebusite.",
    "Weak arguments! which yet he knew full well,",
    "Were strong with people easy to rebel.",
    "For, govern'd by the moon, the giddy Jews",
    "Tread the same track when she the prime renews:",
    "And once in twenty years, their scribes record,",
    "By natural instinct they change their lord.",
    "Achitophel still wants a chief, and none",
    "Was found so fit as warlike Absalom:",
    "Not, that he wish'd his greatness to create,",
    "(For politicians neither love nor hate:)",
    "But, for he knew, his title not allow'd,",
    "Would keep him still depending on the crowd:",
    "That kingly pow'r, thus ebbing out, might be",
    "Drawn to the dregs of a democracy.",
    "Him he attempts, with studied arts to please,",
    "And sheds his venom, in such words as these.",
    "Auspicious Prince! at whose nativity",
    "Some royal planet rul'd the southern sky;",
    "Thy longing country's darling and desire;",
    "Their cloudy pillar, and their guardian fire:",
    "Their second Moses, whose extended wand",
    "Divides the seas, and shows the promis'd land:",
    "Whose dawning day, in very distant age,",
    "Has exercis'd the sacred prophet's rage:",
    "The people's pray'r, the glad diviner's theme,",
    "The young men's vision, and the old men's dream!",
    "Thee, Saviour, thee, the nation's vows confess;",
    "And, never satisfi'd with seeing, bless:",
    "Swift, unbespoken pomps, thy steps proclaim,",
    "And stammering babes are taught to lisp thy name.",
    "How long wilt thou the general joy detain;",
    "Starve, and defraud the people of thy reign?",
    "Content ingloriously to pass thy days",
    "Like one of virtue's fools that feeds on praise;",
    "Till thy fresh glories, which now shine so bright,",
    "Grow stale and tarnish with our daily sight.",
    "Believe me, royal youth, thy fruit must be,",
    "Or gather'd ripe, or rot upon the tree.",
    "Heav'n has to all allotted, soon or late,",
    "Some lucky revolution of their fate:",
    "Whose motions if we watch and guide with skill,",
    "(For human good depends on human will,)",
    "Our fortune rolls, as from a smooth descent,",
    "And, from the first impression, takes the bent:",
    "But, if unseiz'd, she glides away like wind;",
    "And leaves repenting folly far behind.",
    "Now, now she meets you, with a glorious prize,",
    "And spreads her locks before her as she flies.",
    "Had thus Old David, from whose loins you spring,",
    "Not dar'd, when fortune call'd him, to be king.",
    "At Gath an exile he might still remain;",
    "And Heaven's anointing oil had been in vain.",
    "Let his successful youth your hopes engage;",
    "But shun th'example of declining age:",
    "Behold him setting in his western skies,",
    "The shadows lengthening as the vapours rise.",
    "He is not now, as when on Jordan's sand",
    "The joyful people throng'd to see him land,",
    "Cov'ring the beach, and black'ning all the strand:",
    "But, like the Prince of Angels from his height,",
    "Comes tumbling downward with diminish'd light:",
    "Betray'd by one poor plot to public scorn:",
    "(Our only blessing since his curst return:)",
    "Those heaps of people which one sheaf did bind,",
    "Blown off, and scatter'd by a puff of wind.",
    "What strength can he to your designs oppose,",
    "Naked of friends and round beset with foes?",
    "If Pharaoh's doubtful succour he should use,",
    "A foreign aid would more incense the Jews:",
    "Proud Egypt would dissembled friendship bring;",
    "Foment the war, but not support the king:",
    "Nor would the royal party e'er unite",
    "With Pharaoh's arms, t'assist the Jebusite;",
    "Or if they should, their interest soon would break,",
    "And with such odious aid, make David weak.",
    "All sorts of men, by my successful arts,",
    "Abhorring kings, estrange their alter'd hearts",
    "From David's rule: And 'tis the general Cry,",
    "Religion, Common-wealth, and Liberty.",
    "If, you, as champion of the public good,",
    "Add to their arms a chief of royal blood;",
    "What may not Israel hope, and what applause",
    "Might such a general gain by such a cause?",
    "Not barren praise alone, that gaudy flow'r,",
    "Fair only to the sight, but solid pow'r:",
    "And nobler is a limited command,",
    "Giv'n by the love of all your native land,",
    "Than a successive title, long, and dark,",
    "Drawn from the mouldy rolls of Noah's Ark.",
    "What cannot praise effect in mighty minds,",
    "When flattery soothes, and when ambition blinds!",
    "Desire of pow'r, on earth a vicious weed,",
    "Yet, sprung from high, is of celestial seed:",
    "In God 'tis glory: And when men aspire,",
    "'Tis but a spark too much of heavenly fire.",
    "Th' ambitious youth, too covetous of fame,",
    "Too full of angel's metal in his frame;",
    "Unwarily was led from virtue's ways;",
    "Made drunk with honour, and debauch'd with praise.",
    "Half loath, and half consenting to the ill,",
    "(For loyal blood within him struggled still)",
    "He thus repli'd.\u2014And what pretence have I",
    "To take up arms for public liberty?",
    "My Father governs with unquestion'd right;",
    "The Faith's defender, and mankind's delight:",
    "Good, gracious, just, observant of the laws;",
    "And Heav'n by wonders has espous'd his cause.",
    "Whom has he wrong'd in all his peaceful reign?",
    "Who sues for justice to his throne in vain?",
    "What millions has he pardon'd of his foes,",
    "Whom just revenge did to his wrath expose?",
    "Mild, easy, humble, studious of our good;",
    "Inclin'd to mercy, and averse from blood.",
    "If mildness ill with stubborn Israel suit,",
    "His crime is God's beloved attribute.",
    "What could he gain, his people to betray,",
    "Or change his right, for arbitrary sway?",
    "Let haughty Pharaoh curse with such a reign,",
    "His fruitful Nile, and yoke a servile train.",
    "If David's rule Jerusalem displease,",
    "The Dog-star heats their brains to this disease.",
    "Why then should I, encouraging the bad,",
    "Turn rebel, and run popularly mad?",
    "Were he a tyrant who, by lawless might,",
    "Oppress'd the Jews, and rais'd the Jebusite,",
    "Well might I mourn; but nature's holy bands",
    "Would curb my spirits, and restrain my hands:",
    "The people might assert their liberty;",
    "But what was right in them, were crime in me.",
    "His favour leaves me nothing to require;",
    "Prevents my wishes, and out-runs desire.",
    "What more can I expect while David lives?",
    "All but his kingly diadem he gives:",
    "And that: but there he paus'd; then sighing, said,",
    "Is justly destin'd for a worthier head.",
    "For when my father from his toils shall rest,",
    "And late augment the number of the blest:",
    "His lawful issue shall the throne ascend;",
    "Or the collat'ral line where that shall end.",
    "His brother, though oppress'd with vulgar spite,",
    "Yet dauntless and secure of native right,",
    "Of every royal virtue stands possess'd;",
    "Still dear to all the bravest, and the best.",
    "His courage foes, his friends his truth proclaim;",
    "His loyalty the king, the world his fame.",
    "His mercy ev'n th'offending crowd will find:",
    "For sure he comes of a forgiving kind.",
    "Why should I then repine at Heaven's decree;",
    "Which gives me no pretence to royalty?",
    "Yet oh that Fate, propitiously inclin'd,",
    "Had rais'd my birth, or had debas'd my mind;",
    "To my large soul, not all her treasure lent,",
    "And then betray'd it to a mean descent.",
    "I find, I find my mounting spirits bold,",
    "And David's part disdains my mother's mold.",
    "Why am I scanted by a niggard-birth?",
    "My soul disclaims the kindred of her earth:",
    "And made for empire, whispers me within;",
    "Desire of greatness is a god-like sin.",
    "Him staggering so when Hell's dire agent found,",
    "While fainting virtue scarce maintain'd her ground,",
    "He pours fresh forces in, and thus replies:",
    "Th'eternal God, supremely good and wise,",
    "Imparts not these prodigious gifts in vain;",
    "What wonders are reserv'd to bless your reign?",
    "Against your will your arguments have shown,",
    "Such virtue's only giv'n to guide a throne.",
    "Not that your father's mildness I contemn;",
    "But manly force becomes the diadem.",
    "'Tis true, he grants the people all they crave;",
    "And more perhaps than subjects ought to have:",
    "For lavish grants suppose a monarch tame,",
    "And more his goodness than his wit proclaim.",
    "But when should people strive their bonds to break,",
    "If not when kings are negligent or weak?",
    "Let him give on till he can give no more,",
    "The thrifty Sanhedrin shall keep him poor:",
    "And every shekel which he can receive,",
    "Shall cost a limb of his prerogative.",
    "To ply him with new plots, shall be my care;",
    "Or plunge him deep in some expensive war;",
    "Which, when his treasure can no more supply,",
    "He must, with the remains of kingship, buy.",
    "His faithful friends, our jealousies and fears",
    "Call Jebusites; and Pharaoh's pensioners:",
    "Whom, when our fury from his aid has torn,",
    "He shall be naked left to public scorn.",
    "The next successor, whom I fear and hate,",
    "My arts have made obnoxious to the state;",
    "Turn'd all his virtues to his overthrow,",
    "And gain'd our elders to pronounce a foe.",
    "His right, for sums of necessary gold,",
    "Shall first be pawn'd, and afterwards be sold:",
    "Till time shall ever-wanting David draw,",
    "To pass your doubtful title into law:",
    "If not; the people have a right supreme",
    "To make their kings; for kings are made for them.",
    "All empire is no more than pow'r in trust:",
    "Which when resum'd, can be no longer just.",
    "Succession, for the general good design'd,",
    "In its own wrong a nation cannot bind:",
    "If altering that, the people can relieve,",
    "Better one suffer, than a nation grieve.",
    "The Jews well know their pow'r: ere Saul they chose,",
    "God was their king, and God they durst depose.",
    "Urge now your piety, your filial name,",
    "A father's right, and fear of future fame;",
    "The public good, the universal call,",
    "To which even Heav'n submitted, answers all.",
    "Nor let his love enchant your generous mind;",
    "'Tis Nature's trick to propagate her kind.",
    "Our fond begetters, who would never die,",
    "Love but themselves in their posterity.",
    "Or let his kindness by th'effects be tri'd,",
    "Or let him lay his vain pretence aside.",
    "God said he lov'd your father; could he bring",
    "A better proof, than to anoint him king?",
    "It surely show'd he lov'd the shepherd well,",
    "Who gave so fair a flock as Israel.",
    "Would David have you thought his darling son?",
    "What means he then, to alienate the crown?",
    "The name of godly he may blush to bear:",
    "'Tis after God's own heart to cheat his heir.",
    "He to his brother gives supreme command;",
    "To you a legacy of barren land:",
    "Perhaps th'old harp, on which he thrums his lays:",
    "Or some dull Hebrew ballad in your praise.",
    "Then the next heir, a prince, severe and wise",
    "Already looks on you with jealous eyes;",
    "Sees through the thin disguises of your arts,",
    "And marks your progress in the people's hearts.",
    "Though now his mighty soul in grief contains,",
    "He meditates revenge who least complains;",
    "And like a lion, slumb'ring in the way,",
    "Or sleep-dissembling, while he waits his prey,",
    "His fearless foes within his distance draws;",
    "Constrains his roaring and contracts his paws:",
    "Till at the last, his time for fury found,",
    "He shoots with sudden vengeance from the ground:",
    "The prostrate vulgar, passes o'er, and spares;",
    "But with a lordly rage, his hunters tears.",
    "Your case no tame expedients will afford;",
    "Resolve on death, or conquest by the sword,",
    "Which for no less a stake than life, you draw;",
    "And self-defence is Nature's eldest law.",
    "Leave the warm people no considering time;",
    "For then rebellion may be thought a crime.",
    "Prevail yourself of what occasion gives,",
    "But try your title while your father lives:",
    "And that your arms may have a fair pretence,",
    "Proclaim, you take them in the king's defence:",
    "Whose sacred life each minute would expose",
    "To plots from seeming friends and secret foes.",
    "And who can sound the depth of David's soul?",
    "Perhaps his fear, his kindness may control.",
    "He fears his brother, though he loves his son,",
    "For plighted vows too late to be undone.",
    "If so, by force he wishes to be gain'd;",
    "Like women's lechery, to seem constrain'd:",
    "Doubt not; but when he most affects the frown,",
    "Commit a pleasing rape upon the crown.",
    "Secure his person to secure your cause;",
    "They who possess the prince, possess the laws.",
    "He said, and this advice above the rest",
    "With Absalom's mild nature suited best;",
    "Unblam'd of life, (ambition set aside,)",
