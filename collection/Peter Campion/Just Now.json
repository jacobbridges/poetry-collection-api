    "a ladybug, its carapace blown open",
    "so a translucent trace of orange gleams",
    "from its body, has ascended link by link",
    "the smudgy silver curve of my watch band.",
    "It must have helicoptered past the sill",
    "while I was slumped here squinting in the paper",
    "at the ashen packaging another bombing's",
    "made of a minivan. Made available",
    "in the photo like the homeless in a poem.",
    "The pain is far away. But then for moments",
    "utterly clear: molten metal guttering",
    "down from the Milky Way to fall on us.",
    "And sometimes, God, it lands with all its will.",
    "My spluttered prayer for it to hold its distance:",
    "how ludicrous to blurt it from this comfort.",
    "Still it impels itself from me. Please stay",
    "away from me. Please stay away from this",
    "insectile soul who only weeks ago",
    "was wind and shit and jasmine leaves and rain."
