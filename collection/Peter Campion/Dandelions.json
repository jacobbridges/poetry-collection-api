    "After the cling of roots and then the \u201cpock\u201d",
    "when they gave way",
    "the recoil up the hand",
    "was a small shock",
    "of emptiness beginning to expand.",
    "Milk frothing from the stems. Leaves inky green",
    "and spiked.",
    "Like blissed-out childhood play",
    "turned mean",
    "they snarled in tangled curls on our driveway.",
    "It happens still. That desolating falling",
    "shudder inside",
    "and then our neighborhood",
    "seems only sprawling",
    "loops...like the patterns eaten on driftwood:",
    "even the home where I grew up (its smell",
    "of lingering",
    "wood-smoke and bacon grease)",
    "seems just a shell",
    "of lathe and paper. But this strange release",
    "follows: this tinge like silver and I feel",
    "the pull of dirt",
    "again, sense mist uncurling",
    "to reveal",
    "no architecture hidden behind the world",
    "except the stories that we make unfolding:",
    "as if our sole real power",
    "were the power",
    "of children holding",
    "this flower that is a weed that is a flower."
