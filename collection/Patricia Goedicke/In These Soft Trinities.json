    "Whenever I see two women",
    "crowned, constellated friends",
    "it is as if three birch trees wept together",
    "in a field by a constant spring.",
    "The third woman isn\u2019t there",
    "exactly, but just before them a flame",
    "bursts out, then disappears",
    "in a blurred, electric shining",
    "that lifts my hair like an animal\u2019s.",
    "In an aura of charged air I remember",
    "my poor mother turned into royalty,",
    "my sister and me in bobby socks",
    "endlessly, all summer long",
    "calling each other Margaret Rose",
    "and Lillibet, Lillibet, Lillibet,",
    "pretending to be princesses...",
    "Now, swollen into these tall blooms",
    "like paper cutouts in water,",
    "in each new neighborhood garden",
    "always, two women talking",
    "nod their three curly heads together:",
    "with bits of dirt on their foreheads, speckled",
    "iris, flaming poppy",
    "in the backyard dynasties of the multiflora",
    "it is the famous funeral photograph",
    "of the Dowager Queen, Queen Mother, stunned Young Queen,",
    "three stepping stones in marble",
    "that haunt me forever, clear",
    "and mysterious as well water, the weight of it",
    "in a bronze bucket swinging",
    "powerfully from my hand.",
    "As the plumcolored shadow rises,",
    "full as a first child in the orchard,",
    "the lost gardening glove on the path,",
    "the single earring tucked",
    "in an odd corner of the purse and then found",
    "here double themselves, then triple:",
    "in these soft trinities",
    "the lives that begin in us",
    "are born and born again like wings.",
    "Secret as doves scuffling",
    "in the wide envelope of wombs",
    "like loose, comfortable aprons flung",
    "over the heads of friends leaning together",
    "in the hum of earth\u2019s plainsong",
    "like a three part round,",
    "like a single voice murmuring",
    "the dream never leaves us, of the self",
    "like a three masted vessel still voyaging:",
    "out of the long matrix of memory,",
    "the royal bulbs in the hold,",
    "the ballast that keeps us upright, loyal",
    "to the dark, deep-bedded throne",
    "of the old country each new soul claims as its own."
