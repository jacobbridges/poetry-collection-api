    "Or will we be lost forever?",
    "In the silence of the last breath",
    "Not taken",
    "The blue sweep of your arm like a dancer",
    "Clowning, in wrinkled pajamas,",
    "Across the sky the abrupt",
    "Brief zigzag of a jay...",
    "All night the whiteness",
    "And all day.",
    "Once we have been lifted up",
    "Into empty morning like ice",
    "In the darkness of these white fields",
    "Neither the ghost tracks of skis",
    "Nor steel skates will wake us",
    "Where are we looking for each other, separated",
    "On the opposite hillside I see you",
    "Miles away from me, a dot",
    "Of faint color reddening, small bruised warmth",
    "Opening its cranberry mouth and saying,",
    "What are you saying?",
    "*",
    "Under a cold blanket",
    "An immense loneliness stretches",
    "In every direction with no fences.",
    "A few sticks tweak the crusted snow:",
    "Thin remnants of an army",
    "Of lost soldiers.",
    "I see footsteps ahead of me but whose",
    "And where will they lead me, parallel",
    "Or converging? Is it not possible there will be one jet trail",
    "That will not vanish,",
    "Two phantom ribbons unfolding",
    "That will not feather themselves away?",
    "*",
    "Wrapped in our white parkas",
    "In what shifting laminations, snowflakes",
    "That mean nothing, transparent eyes spitting,",
    "What glacier will we choose to lie on,",
    "In what igloo rest",
    "Barely breathing, in an air pocket",
    "Just below the surface",
    "Rustling beneath blizzards",
    "Where is your foot, most beautiful",
    "With blue toenails",
    "I will be looking for it always",
    "Wherever it is, next to me",
    "In the darkness",
    "Of rumpled white sheets,",
    "Pale siftings, clouds",
    "Sudden scarves of ourselves gusting",
    "Loose, sandpapery as snow lifting",
    "In what chill citadel of ice crystals",
    "Will I find you?"
