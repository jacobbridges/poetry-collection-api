    "Luggage first, the lining of his suit jacket dangling",
    "As always, just when you\u2019d given up hope",
    "Nimbly he backs out of the taxi",
    "Eyes nervously extending, like brave crabs",
    "Everywhere at once, keeping track of his papers",
    "He pilots himself into the home berth",
    "Like a small tug in a cloud of seagulls",
    "Worries flutter around him so thick",
    "It takes him some time to arrive",
    "And you wonder if he\u2019s ever really been happy:",
    "When the blue eyes blur",
    "And stare out to sea",
    "Whether it\u2019s only a daydream",
    "Or a long pain that silences him",
    "In such gray distances",
    "You\u2019ll never know, but now",
    "Turning to you, the delicate mouth",
    "Like a magician",
    "Is curious, sensitive, playing tricks,",
    "Pouting like a wise turtle",
    "It seems he has a secret",
    "With the driver,",
    "With the stewardess on the airplane",
    "So that even when he opens his arms",
    "When the warm voice surrounds you,",
    "Wraps you in rough bliss,",
    "Just before you go under",
    "Suddenly you remember:",
    "The beloved does not come",
    "From nowhere: out of himself, alone",
    "Often he comes slowly, carefully",
    "After a long taxi ride",
    "Past many beautiful men and women",
    "And many dead bodies,",
    "Mysterious and important companions."
