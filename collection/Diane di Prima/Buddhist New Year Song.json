    "I saw you in green velvet, wide full sleeves",
    "seated in front of a fireplace, our house",
    "made somehow more gracious, and you said",
    "\u201cThere are stars in your hair\u201d\u2014 it was truth I",
    "brought down with me",
    "to this sullen and dingy place that we must make golden",
    "make precious and mythical somehow, it is our nature,",
    "and it is truth, that we came here, I told you,",
    "from other planets",
    "where we were lords, we were sent here,",
    "for some purpose",
    "the golden mask I had seen before, that fitted",
    "so beautifully over your face, did not return",
    "nor did that face of a bull you had acquired",
    "amid northern peoples, nomads, the Gobi desert",
    "I did not see those tents again, nor the wagons",
    "infinitely slow on the infinitely windy plains,",
    "so cold, every star in the sky was a different color",
    "the sky itself a tangled tapestry, glowing",
    "but almost, I could see the planet from which we had come",
    "I could not remember (then) what our purpose was",
    "but remembered the name Mahakala, in the dawn",
    "in the dawn confronted Shiva, the cold light",
    "revealed the \u201cmindborn\u201d worlds, as simply that,",
    "I watched them propagated, flowing out,",
    "or, more simply, one mirror reflecting another.",
    "then broke the mirrors, you were no longer in sight",
    "nor any purpose, stared at this new blackness",
    "the mindborn worlds fled, and the mind turned off:",
    "a madness, or a beginning?"
