    "I, as sinned against as sinning,",
    "take small pleasure from the winning",
    "of our decades-long guerrilla war.",
    "For from my job I've wanted more",
    "than victory over one who'd tried",
    "to punish me before he died,",
    "and now, neither of us dead,",
    "we haunt these halls in constant dread",
    "of drifting past the other's life",
    "while long-term memory is rife",
    "with slights that sting like paper cuts.",
    "We've occupied our separate ruts",
    "yet simmered in a single rage.",
    "We've grown absurd in middle age",
    "together, and should seek wisdom now",
    "together, by ending this row.",
    "I therefore decommission you",
    "as constant flagship of my rue.",
    "Below the threshold of my hate",
    "you now my good regard may rate.",
    "For I have let my anger pass.",
    "But, while you're down there, kiss my ass."
