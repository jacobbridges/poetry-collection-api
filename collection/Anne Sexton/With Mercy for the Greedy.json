    "Concerning your letter in which you ask",
    "me to call a priest and in which you ask",
    "me to wear The Cross that you enclose;",
    "your own cross,",
    "your dog-bitten cross,",
    "no larger than a thumb,",
    "small and wooden, no thorns, this rose\u2014",
    "I pray to its shadow,",
    "that gray place",
    "where it lies on your letter ... deep, deep.",
    "I detest my sins and I try to believe",
    "in The Cross. I touch its tender hips, its dark jawed face,",
    "its solid neck, its brown sleep.",
    "True. There is",
    "a beautiful Jesus.",
    "He is frozen to his bones like a chunk of beef.",
    "How desperately he wanted to pull his arms in!",
    "How desperately I touch his vertical and horizontal axes!",
    "But I can\u2019t. Need is not quite belief.",
    "All morning long",
    "I have worn",
    "your cross, hung with package string around my throat.",
    "It tapped me lightly as a child\u2019s heart might,",
    "tapping secondhand, softly waiting to be born.",
    "Ruth, I cherish the letter you wrote.",
    "My friend, my friend, I was born",
    "doing reference work in sin, and born",
    "confessing it. This is what poems are:",
    "with mercy",
    "for the greedy,",
    "they are the tongue\u2019s wrangle,",
    "the world's pottage, the rat's star."
