    "I have gone out, a possessed witch,",

    "lonely thing, twelve-fingered, out of mind.",
    "A woman like that is not a woman, quite.",
    "I have been her kind.",
    "I have found the warm caves in the woods,",
    "filled them with skillets, carvings, shelves,",
    "closets, silks, innumerable goods;",
    "fixed the suppers for the worms and the elves:",
    "whining, rearranging the disaligned.",
    "A woman like that is misunderstood.",
    "I have been her kind.",
    "I have ridden in your cart, driver,",
    "waved my nude arms at villages going by,",
    "learning the last bright routes, survivor",
    "where your flames still bite my thigh",
    "and my ribs crack where your wheels wind.",
    "A woman like that is not ashamed to die.",
    "I have been her kind."
