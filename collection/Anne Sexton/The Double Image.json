    "1.",
    "I am thirty this November.",
    "You are still small, in your fourth year.",
    "We stand watching the yellow leaves go queer,",
    "flapping in the winter rain,",
    "falling flat and washed. And I remember",
    "mostly the three autumns you did not live here.",
    "They said I\u2019d never get you back again.",
    "I tell you what you\u2019ll never really know:",
    "all the medical hypothesis",
    "that explained my brain will never be as true as these",
    "struck leaves letting go.",
    "I, who chose two times",
    "to kill myself, had said your nickname",
    "the mewling months when you first came;",
    "until a fever rattled",
    "in your throat and I moved like a pantomime",
    "above your head. Ugly angels spoke to me. The blame,",
    "I heard them say, was mine. They tattled",
    "like green witches in my head, letting doom",
    "leak like a broken faucet;",
    "as if doom had flooded my belly and filled your bassinet,",
    "an old debt I must assume.",
    "Death was simpler than I\u2019d thought.",
    "The day life made you well and whole",
    "I let the witches take away my guilty soul.",
    "I pretended I was dead",
    "until the white men pumped the poison out,",
    "putting me armless and washed through the rigamarole",
    "of talking boxes and the electric bed.",
    "I laughed to see the private iron in that hotel.",
    "Today the yellow leaves",
    "go queer. You ask me where they go. I say today believed",
    "in itself, or else it fell.",
    "Today, my small child, Joyce,",
    "love your self\u2019s self where it lives.",
    "There is no special God to refer to; or if there is,",
    "why did I let you grow",
    "in another place. You did not know my voice",
    "when I came back to call. All the superlatives",
    "of tomorrow\u2019s white tree and mistletoe",
    "will not help you know the holidays you had to miss.",
    "The time I did not love",
    "myself, I visited your shoveled walks; you held my glove.",
    "There was new snow after this.",
    "2.",
    "They sent me letters with news",
    "of you and I made moccasins that I would never use.",
    "When I grew well enough to tolerate",
    "myself, I lived with my mother. Too late,",
    "too late, to live with your mother, the witches said.",
    "But I didn\u2019t leave. I had my portrait",
    "done instead.",
    "Part way back from Bedlam",
    "I came to my mother\u2019s house in Gloucester,",
    "Massachusetts. And this is how I came",
    "to catch at her; and this is how I lost her.",
    "I cannot forgive your suicide, my mother said.",
    "And she never could. She had my portrait",
    "done instead.",
    "I lived like an angry guest,",
    "like a partly mended thing, an outgrown child.",
    "I remember my mother did her best.",
    "She took me to Boston and had my hair restyled.",
    "Your smile is like your mother\u2019s, the artist said.",
    "I didn\u2019t seem to care. I had my portrait",
    "done instead.",
    "There was a church where I grew up",
    "with its white cupboards where they locked us up,",
    "row by row, like puritans or shipmates",
    "singing together. My father passed the plate.",
    "Too late to be forgiven now, the witches said.",
    "I wasn\u2019t exactly forgiven. They had my portrait",
    "done instead.",
    "3.",
    "All that summer sprinklers arched",
    "over the seaside grass.",
    "We talked of drought",
    "while the salt-parched",
    "field grew sweet again. To help time pass",
    "I tried to mow the lawn",
    "and in the morning I had my portrait done,",
    "holding my smile in place, till it grew formal.",
    "Once I mailed you a picture of a rabbit",
    "and a postcard of Motif number one,",
    "as if it were normal",
    "to be a mother and be gone.",
    "They hung my portrait in the chill",
    "north light, matching",
    "me to keep me well.",
    "Only my mother grew ill.",
    "She turned from me, as if death were catching,",
    "as if death transferred,",
    "as if my dying had eaten inside of her.",
    "That August you were two, but I timed my days with doubt.",
    "On the first of September she looked at me",
    "and said I gave her cancer.",
    "They carved her sweet hills out",
    "and still I couldn\u2019t answer.",
    "4.",
    "That winter she came",
    "part way back",
    "from her sterile suite",
    "of doctors, the seasick",
    "cruise of the X-ray,",
    "the cells\u2019 arithmetic",
    "gone wild. Surgery incomplete,",
    "the fat arm, the prognosis poor, I heard",
    "them say.",
    "During the sea blizzards",
    "she had here",
    "own portrait painted.",
    "A cave of mirror",
    "placed on the south wall;",
    "matching smile, matching contour.",
    "And you resembled me; unacquainted",
    "with my face, you wore it. But you were mine",
    "after all.",
    "I wintered in Boston,",
    "childless bride,",
    "nothing sweet to spare",
    "with witches at my side.",
    "I missed your babyhood,",
    "tried a second suicide,",
    "tried the sealed hotel a second year.",
    "On April Fool you fooled me. We laughed and this",
    "was good.",
    "5.",
    "I checked out for the last time",
    "on the first of May;",
    "graduate of the mental cases,",
    "with my analyst\u2019s okay,",
    "my complete book of rhymes,",
    "my typewriter and my suitcases.",
    "All that summer I learned life",
    "back into my own",
    "seven rooms, visited the swan boats,",
    "the market, answered the phone,",
    "served cocktails as a wife",
    "should, made love among my petticoats",
    "and August tan. And you came each",
    "weekend. But I lie.",
    "You seldom came. I just pretended",
    "you, small piglet, butterfly",
    "girl with jelly bean cheeks,",
    "disobedient three, my splendid",
    "stranger. And I had to learn",
    "why I would rather",
    "die than love, how your innocence",
    "would hurt and how I gather",
    "guilt like a young intern",
    "his symptoms, his certain evidence.",
    "That October day we went",
    "to Gloucester the red hills",
    "reminded me of the dry red fur fox",
    "coat I played in as a child; stock-still",
    "like a bear or a tent,",
    "like a great cave laughing or a red fur fox.",
    "We drove past the hatchery,",
    "the hut that sells bait,",
    "past Pigeon Cove, past the Yacht Club, past Squall\u2019s",
    "Hill, to the house that waits",
    "still, on the top of the sea,",
    "and two portraits hung on the opposite walls.",
    "6.",
    "In north light, my smile is held in place,",
    "the shadow marks my bone.",
    "What could I have been dreaming as I sat there,",
    "all of me waiting in the eyes, the zone",
    "of the smile, the young face,",
    "the foxes\u2019 snare.",
    "In south light, her smile is held in place,",
    "her cheeks wilting like a dry",
    "orchid; my mocking mirror, my overthrown",
    "love, my first image. She eyes me from that face,",
    "that stony head of death",
    "I had outgrown.",
    "The artist caught us at the turning;",
    "we smiled in our canvas home",
    "before we chose our foreknown separate ways.",
    "The dry red fur fox coat was made for burning.",
    "I rot on the wall, my own",
    "Dorian Gray.",
    "And this was the cave of the mirror,",
    "that double woman who stares",
    "at herself, as if she were petrified",
    "in time \u2014 two ladies sitting in umber chairs.",
    "You kissed your grandmother",
    "and she cried.",
    "7.",
    "I could not get you back",
    "except for weekends. You came",
    "each time, clutching the picture of a rabbit",
    "that I had sent you. For the last time I unpack",
    "your things. We touch from habit.",
    "The first visit you asked my name.",
    "Now you stay for good. I will forget",
    "how we bumped away from each other like marionettes",
    "on strings. It wasn\u2019t the same",
    "as love, letting weekends contain",
    "us. You scrape your knee. You learn my name,",
    "wobbling up the sidewalk, calling and crying.",
    "You call me",
    "and I remember my mother again,",
    "somewhere in greater Boston, dying.",
    "I remember we named you Joyce",
    "so we could call you Joy.",
    "You came like an awkward guest",
    "that first time, all wrapped and moist",
    "and strange at my heavy breast.",
    "I needed you. I didn\u2019t want a boy,",
    "only a girl, a small milky mouse",
    "of a girl, already loved, already loud in the house",
    "of herself. We named you Joy.",
    "I, who was never quite sure",
    "about being a girl, needed another",
    "life, another image to remind me.",
    "And this was my worst guilt; you could not cure",
    "nor soothe it. I made you to find me."
