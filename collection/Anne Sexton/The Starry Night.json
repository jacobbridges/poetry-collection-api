    "The town does not exist",
    "except where one black-haired tree slips",
    "up like a drowned woman into the hot sky.",
    "The town is silent. The night boils with eleven stars.",
    "Oh starry starry night! This is how",
    "I want to die.",
    "It moves. They are all alive.",
    "Even the moon bulges in its orange irons",
    "to push children, like a god, from its eye.",
    "The old unseen serpent swallows up the stars.",
    "Oh starry starry night! This is how",
    "I want to die:",
    "into that rushing beast of the night,",
    "sucked up by that great dragon, to split",
    "from my life with no flag,",
    "no belly,",
    "no cry."
