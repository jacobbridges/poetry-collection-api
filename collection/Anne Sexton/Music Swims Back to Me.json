    "Wait Mister. Which way is home?",
    "They turned the light out",
    "and the dark is moving in the corner.",
    "There are no sign posts in this room,",
    "four ladies, over eighty,",
    "in diapers every one of them.",
    "La la la, Oh music swims back to me",
    "and I can feel the tune they played",
    "the night they left me",
    "in this private institution on a hill.",
    "Imagine it. A radio playing",
    "and everyone here was crazy.",
    "I liked it and danced in a circle.",
    "Music pours over the sense",
    "and in a funny way",
    "music sees more than I.",
    "I mean it remembers better;",
    "remembers the first night here.",
    "It was the strangled cold of November;",
    "even the stars were strapped in the sky",
    "and that moon too bright",
    "forking through the bars to stick me",
    "with a singing in the head.",
    "I have forgotten all the rest.",
    "They lock me in this chair at eight a.m.",
    "and there are no signs to tell the way,",
    "just the radio beating to itself",
    "and the song that remembers",
    "more than I. Oh, la la la,",
    "this music swims back to me.",
    "The night I came I danced a circle",
    "and was not afraid.",
    "Mister?"
