    "It was only important",

    "and not to talk.",

    "like a cave or a mouth",
    "or an indoor belly.",

    "and daddy was there,",
    "his thumbs, his fat skull,",
    "his teeth, his hair growing",
    "like a field or a shawl.",
    "I lay by the moss",
    "of his skin until",
    "it grew strange. My sisters",
    "will never know that I fall",
    "out of myself and pretend",
    "that Allah will not see",
    "how I hold my daddy",
    "like an old stone tree."
