    "Gone, I say and walk from church,",
    "refusing the stiff procession to the grave,",
    "letting the dead ride alone in the hearse.",
    "It is June. I am tired of being brave.",
    "We drive to the Cape. I cultivate",
    "myself where the sun gutters from the sky,",
    "where the sea swings in like an iron gate",
    "and we touch. In another country people die.",
    "My darling, the wind falls in like stones",
    "from the whitehearted water and when we touch",
    "we enter touch entirely. No one\u2019s alone.",
    "Men kill for this, or for as much.",
    "And what of the dead? They lie without shoes",
    "in their stone boats. They are more like stone",
    "than the sea would be if it stopped. They refuse",
    "to be blessed, throat, eye and knucklebone."
