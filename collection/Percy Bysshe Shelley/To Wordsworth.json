    "Poet of Nature, thou hast wept to know",
    "That things depart which never may return:",
    "Childhood and youth, friendship and love\u2019s first glow,",
    "Have fled like sweet dreams, leaving thee to mourn.",
    "These common woes I feel. One loss is mine",
    "Which thou too feel\u2019st, yet I alone deplore.",
    "Thou wert as a lone star, whose light did shine",
    "On some frail bark in winter\u2019s midnight roar:",
    "Thou hast like to a rock-built refuge stood",
    "Above the blind and battling multitude:",
    "In honoured poverty thy voice did weave",
    "Songs consecrate to truth and liberty,\u2014",
    "Deserting these, thou leavest me to grieve,",
    "Thus having been, that thou shouldst cease to be."
