    "Many a green isle needs must be",
    "In the deep wide sea of Misery,",
    "Or the mariner, worn and wan,",
    "Never thus could voyage on",
    "Day and night, and night and day,",
    "Drifting on his dreary way,",
    "With the solid darkness black",
    "Closing round his vessel's track;",
    "Whilst above, the sunless sky,",
    "Big with clouds, hangs heavily,",
    "And behind, the tempest fleet",
    "Hurries on with lightning feet,",
    "Riving sail, and cord, and plank,",
    "Till the ship has almost drank",
    "Death from the o'er-brimming deep;",
    "And sinks down, down, like that sleep",
    "When the dreamer seems to be",
    "Weltering through eternity;",
    "And the dim low line before",
    "Of a dark and distant shore",
    "Still recedes, as ever still",
    "Longing with divided will,",
    "But no power to seek or shun,",
    "He is ever drifted on",
    "O'er the unreposing wave",
    "To the haven of the grave.",
    "What, if there no friends will greet;",
    "What, if there no heart will meet",
    "His with love's impatient beat;",
    "Wander wheresoe'er he may,",
    "Can he dream before that day",
    "To find refuge from distress",
    "In friendship's smile, in love's caress?",
    "Then 'twill wreak him little woe",
    "Whether such there be or no:",
    "Senseless is the breast and cold",
    "Which relenting love would fold;",
    "Bloodless are the veins and chill",
    "Which the pulse of pain did fill;",
    "Every little living nerve",
    "That from bitter words did swerve",
    "Round the tortur'd lips and brow,",
    "Are like sapless leaflets now",
    "Frozen upon December's bough.",
    "On the beach of a northern sea",
    "Which tempests shake eternally,",
    "As once the wretch there lay to sleep,",
    "Lies a solitary heap,",
    "One white skull and seven dry bones,",
    "On the margin of the stones,",
    "Where a few gray rushes stand,",
    "Boundaries of the sea and land:",
    "Nor is heard one voice of wail",
    "But the sea-mews, as they sail",
    "O'er the billows of the gale;",
    "Or the whirlwind up and down",
    "Howling, like a slaughter'd town,",
    "When a king in glory rides",
    "Through the pomp of fratricides:",
    "Those unburied bones around",
    "There is many a mournful sound;",
    "There is no lament for him,",
    "Like a sunless vapour, dim,",
    "Who once cloth'd with life and thought",
    "What now moves nor murmurs not.",
    "Ay, many flowering islands lie",
    "In the waters of wide Agony:",
    "To such a one this morn was led",
    "My bark, by soft winds piloted:",
    "'Mid the mountains Euganean",
    "I stood listening to the paean",
    "With which the legion'd rooks did hail",
    "The sun's uprise majestical;",
    "Gathering round with wings all hoar,",
    "Through the dewy mist they soar",
    "Like gray shades, till the eastern heaven",
    "Bursts, and then, as clouds of even,",
    "Fleck'd with fire and azure, lie",
    "In the unfathomable sky,",
    "So their plumes of purple grain,",
    "Starr'd with drops of golden rain,",
    "Gleam above the sunlight woods,",
    "As in silent multitudes",
    "On the morning's fitful gale",
    "Through the broken mist they sail,",
    "And the vapours cloven and gleaming",
    "Follow, down the dark steep streaming,",
    "Till all is bright, and clear, and still,",
    "Round the solitary hill.",
    "Beneath is spread like a green sea",
    "The waveless plain of Lombardy,",
    "Bounded by the vaporous air,",
    "Islanded by cities fair;",
    "Underneath Day's azure eyes",
    "Ocean's nursling, Venice lies,",
    "A peopled labyrinth of walls,",
    "Amphitrite's destin'd halls,",
    "Which her hoary sire now paves",
    "With his blue and beaming waves.",
    "Lo! the sun upsprings behind,",
    "Broad, red, radiant, half-reclin'd",
    "On the level quivering line",
    "Of the water crystalline;",
    "And before that chasm of light,",
    "As within a furnace bright,",
    "Column, tower, and dome, and spire,",
    "Shine like obelisks of fire,",
    "Pointing with inconstant motion",
    "From the altar of dark ocean",
    "To the sapphire-tinted skies;",
    "As the flames of sacrifice",
    "From the marble shrines did rise,",
    "As to pierce the dome of gold",
    "Where Apollo spoke of old.",
    "Sun-girt City, thou hast been",
    "Ocean's child, and then his queen;",
    "Now is come a darker day,",
    "And thou soon must be his prey,",
    "If the power that rais'd thee here",
    "Hallow so thy watery bier.",
    "A less drear ruin then than now,",
    "With thy conquest-branded brow",
    "Stooping to the slave of slaves",
    "From thy throne, among the waves",
    "Wilt thou be, when the sea-mew",
    "Flies, as once before it flew,",
    "O'er thine isles depopulate,",
    "And all is in its ancient state,",
    "Save where many a palace gate",
    "With green sea-flowers overgrown",
    "Like a rock of Ocean's own,",
    "Topples o'er the abandon'd sea",
    "As the tides change sullenly.",
    "The fisher on his watery way,",
    "Wandering at the close of day,",
    "Will spread his sail and seize his oar",
    "Till he pass the gloomy shore,",
    "Lest thy dead should, from their sleep",
    "Bursting o'er the starlight deep,",
    "Lead a rapid masque of death",
    "O'er the waters of his path.",
    "Those who alone thy towers behold",
    "Quivering through a{:e}real gold,",
    "As I now behold them here,",
    "Would imagine not they were",
    "Sepulchres, where human forms,",
    "Like pollution-nourish'd worms,",
    "To the corpse of greatness cling,",
    "Murder'd, and now mouldering:",
    "But if Freedom should awake",
    "In her omnipotence, and shake",
    "From the Celtic Anarch's hold",
    "All the keys of dungeons cold,",
    "Where a hundred cities lie",
    "Chain'd like thee, ingloriously,",
    "Thou and all thy sister band",
    "Might adorn this sunny land,",
    "Twining memories of old time",
    "With new virtues more sublime;",
    "If not, perish thou and they,",
    "Clouds which stain truth's rising day",
    "By her sun consum'd away\u2014",
    "Earth can spare ye! while like flowers,",
    "In the waste of years and hours,",
    "From your dust new nations spring",
    "With more kindly blossoming.",
    "Perish\u2014let there only be",
    "Floating o'er thy hearthless sea",
    "As the garment of thy sky",
    "Clothes the world immortally,",
    "One remembrance, more sublime",
    "Than the tatter'd pall of time,",
    "Which scarce hides thy visage wan:",
    "That a tempest-cleaving Swan",
    "Of the sons of Albion,",
    "Driven from his ancestral streams",
    "By the might of evil dreams,",
    "Found a nest in thee; and Ocean",
    "Welcom'd him with such emotion",
    "That its joy grew his, and sprung",
    "From his lips like music flung",
    "O'er a mighty thunder-fit,",
    "Chastening terror: what though yet",
    "Poesy's unfailing river,",
    "Which through Albion winds forever",
    "Lashing with melodious wave",
    "Many a sacred Poet's grave,",
    "Mourn its latest nursling fled!",
    "What though thou with all thy dead",
    "Scarce can for this fame repay",
    "Aught thine own, oh, rather say",
    "Though thy sins and slaveries foul",
    "Overcloud a sunlike soul!",
    "As the ghost of Homer clings",
    "Round Scamander's wasting springs;",
    "As divinest Shakespeare's might",
    "Fills Avon and the world with light",
    "Like omniscient power which he",
    "Imag'd 'mid mortality;",
    "As the love from Petrarch's urn",
    "Yet amid yon hills doth burn,",
    "A quenchless lamp by which the heart",
    "Sees things unearthly; so thou art,",
    "Mighty spirit: so shall be",
    "The City that did refuge thee.",
    "Lo, the sun floats up the sky",
    "Like thought-winged Liberty,",
    "Till the universal light",
    "Seems to level plain and height;",
    "From the sea a mist has spread,",
    "And the beams of morn lie dead",
    "On the towers of Venice now,",
    "Like its glory long ago.",
    "By the skirts of that gray cloud",
    "Many-domed Padua proud",
    "Stands, a peopled solitude,",
    "'Mid the harvest-shining plain,",
    "Where the peasant heaps his grain",
    "In the garner of his foe,",
    "And the milk-white oxen slow",
    "With the purple vintage strain,",
    "Heap'd upon the creaking wain,",
    "That the brutal Celt may swill",
    "Drunken sleep with savage will;",
    "And the sickle to the sword",
    "Lies unchang'd though many a lord,",
    "Like a weed whose shade is poison,",
    "Overgrows this region's foison,",
    "Sheaves of whom are ripe to come",
    "To destruction's harvest-home:",
    "Men must reap the things they sow,",
    "Force from force must ever flow,",
    "Or worse; but 'tis a bitter woe",
    "That love or reason cannot change",
    "The despot's rage, the slave's revenge.",
    "Padua, thou within whose walls",
    "Those mute guests at festivals,",
    "Son and Mother, Death and Sin,",
    "Play'd at dice for Ezzelin,",
    "Till Death cried, 'I win, I win!'",
    "And Sin curs'd to lose the wager,",
    "But Death promis'd, to assuage her,",
    "That he would petition for",
    "Her to be made Vice-Emperor,",
    "When the destin'd years were o'er,",
    "Over all between the Po",
    "And the eastern Alpine snow,",
    "Under the mighty Austrian.",
    "Sin smil'd so as Sin only can,",
    "And since that time, ay, long before,",
    "Both have rul'd from shore to shore,",
    "That incestuous pair, who follow",
    "Tyrants as the sun the swallow,",
    "As Repentance follows Crime,",
    "And as changes follow Time.",
    "In thine halls the lamp of learning,",
    "Padua, now no more is burning;",
    "Like a meteor, whose wild way",
    "Is lost over the grave of day,",
    "It gleams betray'd and to betray:",
    "Once remotest nations came",
    "To adore that sacred flame,",
    "When it lit not many a hearth",
    "On this cold and gloomy earth:",
    "Now new fires from antique light",
    "Spring beneath the wide world's might;",
    "But their spark lies dead in thee,",
    "Trampled out by Tyranny.",
    "As the Norway woodman quells,",
    "In the depth of piny dells,",
    "One light flame among the brakes,",
    "While the boundless forest shakes,",
    "And its mighty trunks are torn",
    "By the fire thus lowly born:",
    "The spark beneath his feet is dead,",
    "He starts to see the flames it fed",
    "Howling through the darken'd sky",
    "With myriad tongues victoriously,",
    "And sinks down in fear: so thou,",
    "O Tyranny, beholdest now",
    "Light around thee, and thou hearest",
    "The loud flames ascend, and fearest:",
    "Grovel on the earth; ay, hide",
    "In the dust thy purple pride!",
    "Noon descends around me now:",
    "'Tis the noon of autumn's glow,",
    "When a soft and purple mist",
    "Like a vaporous amethyst,",
    "Or an air-dissolved star",
    "Mingling light and fragrance, far",
    "From the curv'd horizon's bound",
    "To the point of Heaven's profound,",
    "Fills the overflowing sky;",
    "And the plains that silent lie",
    "Underneath, the leaves unsodden",
    "Where the infant Frost has trodden",
    "With his morning-winged feet,",
    "Whose bright print is gleaming yet;",
    "And the red and golden vines,",
    "Piercing with their trellis'd lines",
    "The rough, dark-skirted wilderness;",
    "The dun and bladed grass no less,",
    "Pointing from his hoary tower",
    "In the windless air; the flower",
    "Glimmering at my feet; the line",
    "Of the olive-sandall'd Apennine",
    "In the south dimly islanded;",
    "And the Alps, whose snows are spread",
    "High between the clouds and sun;",
    "And of living things each one;",
    "And my spirit which so long",
    "Darken'd this swift stream of song,",
    "Interpenetrated lie",
    "By the glory of the sky:",
    "Be it love, light, harmony,",
    "Odour, or the soul of all",
    "Which from Heaven like dew doth fall,",
    "Or the mind which feeds this verse",
    "Peopling the lone universe.",
    "Noon descends, and after noon",
    "Autumn's evening meets me soon,",
    "Leading the infantine moon,",
    "And that one star, which to her",
    "Almost seems to minister",
    "Half the crimson light she brings",
    "From the sunset's radiant springs:",
    "And the soft dreams of the morn",
    "(Which like winged winds had borne",
    "To that silent isle, which lies",
    "Mid remember'd agonies,",
    "The frail bark of this lone being)",
    "Pass, to other sufferers fleeing,",
    "And its ancient pilot, Pain,",
    "Sits beside the helm again.",
    "Other flowering isles must be",
    "In the sea of Life and Agony:",
    "Other spirits float and flee",
    "O'er that gulf: even now, perhaps,",
    "On some rock the wild wave wraps,",
    "With folded wings they waiting sit",
    "For my bark, to pilot it",
    "To some calm and blooming cove,",
    "Where for me, and those I love,",
    "May a windless bower be built,",
    "Far from passion, pain and guilt,",
    "In a dell mid lawny hills,",
    "Which the wild sea-murmur fills,",
    "And soft sunshine, and the sound",
    "Of old forests echoing round,",
    "And the light and smell divine",
    "Of all flowers that breathe and shine:",
    "We may live so happy there,",
    "That the Spirits of the Air,",
    "Envying us, may even entice",
    "To our healing paradise",
    "The polluting multitude;",
    "But their rage would be subdu'd",
    "By that clime divine and calm,",
    "And the winds whose wings rain balm",
    "On the uplifted soul, and leaves",
    "Under which the bright sea heaves;",
    "While each breathless interval",
    "In their whisperings musical",
    "The inspired soul supplies",
    "With its own deep melodies,",
    "And the love which heals all strife",
    "Circling, like the breath of life,",
    "All things in that sweet abode",
    "With its own mild brotherhood:",
    "They, not it, would change; and soon",
    "Every sprite beneath the moon",
    "Would repent its envy vain,",
    "And the earth grow young again."
