    "I sowed the seeds of love",
    "To blossom all the spring,",
    "In April, May, or else in June,",
    "When the small birds do sing:",
    "A gardener standing by,",
    "I desired him to choose for me;",
    "He picked out the lily, the violet, and pink,",
    "But I refused all three.",
    "The lily I refused,",
    "Because it faded so soon;",
    "The violet and pink I overlooked,",
    "Resolved was to tarry till June:",
    "In June the red roses bud,",
    "Oh, that is a lover for me;",
    "But I have often aimed at the red rose-bud,",
    "And I have gained the willow tree.",
    "The gardener standing by,",
    "He prayed me to have a care,",
    "For the thorn that grew on the red rose-bush,",
    "A venomous thorn they were:",
    "A venomous thorn indeed,",
    "For still I feel the smart;",
    "And every time I did it touch,",
    "It pricked my tender heart.",
    "Away you fading flowers,",
    "No more I will you touch,",
    "That all the world may plainly see",
    "I loved one flower too much."
