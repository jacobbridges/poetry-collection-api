    "Whether it was a particular beauty",
    "Stirred the tearfall from the eyelid\u2019s rim,",
    "Rinsing the world once more with self,",
    "Was it not there the general peered,",
    "Thousand-eyed, down from the peak",
    "In the last of all imaginary sunsets?",
    "The light divided in half, the half",
    "Divided again in half, the way",
    "Zeno\u2019s paradox makes nothing move",
    "Because an infinity of points between",
    "Target and arrow, though never seen,",
    "Exists. And there is snow in a capsule,",
    "A solid floor of individual",
    "Flakes that, shaken, settle in a field\u2014",
    "Parachutists growing where the grass,",
    "One moment before, was only natural.",
    "I am speaking now of the diminishment",
    "Or enhancement of enchanted objects,",
    "Of how they turn into nothingness",
    "Or burnish the imagination:",
    "A fire at the bottom of the sea,",
    "For instance, or a mind in space",
    "Thinking its way into science fiction,",
    "Or, inside the skull, a little world",
    "Clinging, about to be thrown away\u2014",
    "Miraculous lint under a bell."
