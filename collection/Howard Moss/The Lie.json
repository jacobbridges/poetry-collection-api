    "Some bloodied sea-bird\u2019s hovering decay",
    "Assails us where we lie, and lie",
    "To make that symbol go away,",
    "To mock the true north of the eye.",
    "But lie to me, lie next to me;",
    "The world is an infirmity.",
    "Too much of sun\u2019s been said, too much",
    "Of sea, and of the lover\u2019s touch,",
    "Whole volumes that old men debauch.",
    "But we, at the sea\u2019s edge curled,",
    "Hurl back their bloody world.",
    "Lie to me, like next to me,",
    "For there is nothing here to see",
    "But the mirrors of ourselves, the day,",
    "Clear with the odors of the sea.",
    "Lie to me. And lie to me."
