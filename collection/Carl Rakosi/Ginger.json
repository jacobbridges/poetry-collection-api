    "frolicksome goat,",
    "Ginger,",
    "tied to a pecan tree?",
    "All morning",
    "it has been examining",
    "an empty bushel basket",
    "and has lifted",
    "one leg delicately",
    "like a circus horse",
    "as if to roll it,",
    "but whether to do that",
    "or to butt it",
    "with its small horns,",
    "that is the question.",
    "Not of great moment,",
    "no signing of the Charter,",
    "but like air music,",
    "quickest of the elements.",
    "Towards which I leaped!",
    "In form",
    "its own grace,",
    "appearing,",
    "as it passed",
    "in retrospect, classical.",
    "The real goat stayed,",
    "imperturbable,",
    "the body solid",
    "as a four-square loom",
    "and delivered me",
    "from abstraction.",
    "His coloring,",
    "greyish-soft shades,",
    "their dark and light",
    "passing into each other",
    "as in an antique rubbing.",

    "sitting so near,",
    "my shade,",
    "as in the Inferno,",
    "sensed his,",
    "but he gave no sign",
    "of my presence,",
    "even when I stroked him",
    "and my heart leaped",
    "at the gentle fleece,",
    "too fine for a hard life.",
    "He continued nibbling",
    "on a dry bush.",
    "I would not have believed",
    "unconcern",
    "could bolster the man in me",
    "and be so enduring.",
    ", not caring",
    "whether it is recognized,",
    "The Divine",
    "(from another age).",
    "He was poking",
    "into the underbush now",
    "and reached across my head",
    "for the small spiny twigs.",
    "At that the phase",
    "changed",
    "and a sensuous trembling",
    "hung in the air,",
    "as when a bee is about",
    "to descend",
    "on blossoming clover,",
    "and I",
    "felt myself being pulled",
    "as by a line",
    "from the invisible",
    "other side",
    "to enter goathood,",
    "deeper than sight."
