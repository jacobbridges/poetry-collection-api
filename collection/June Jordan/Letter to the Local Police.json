    "Dear Sirs:",

    "my wife and I, our two cats, and miscellaneous",
    "photographs of the six grandchildren belonging to",

    "close) arrived in Saratoga Springs which is clearly",
    "prospering under your custody",
    "Indeed, until yesterday afternoon and despite my",
    "vigilant casting about, I have been unable to discover",
    "a single instance of reasons for public-spirited concern,",
    "much less complaint",
    "You may easily appreciate, then, how it is that",
    "I write to your office, at this date, with utmost",
    "regret for the lamentable circumstances that force",
    "my hand",
    "Speaking directly to the issue of the moment:",
    "I have encountered a regular profusion of certain",
    "unidentified roses, growing to no discernible purpose,",
    "and according to no perceptible control, approximately",
    "one quarter mile west of the Northway, on the southern",
    "side",
    "To be specific, there are practically thousands of",
    "the aforementioned abiding in perpetual near riot",
    "of wild behavior, indiscriminate coloring, and only",
    "the Good Lord Himself can say what diverse soliciting",
    "of promiscuous cross-fertilization",
    "As I say, these roses, no matter what the apparent",
    "background, training, tropistic tendencies, age,",
    "or color, do not demonstrate the least inclination",
    "toward categorization, specified allegiance, resolute",
    "preference, consideration of the needs of others, or",
    "any other minimal traits of decency",
    "May I point out that I did not assiduously seek out",
    "this colony, as it were, and that these certain",
    "unidentified roses remain open to viewing even by",
    "children, with or without suitable supervision",
    "(My wife asks me to append a note as regards the",
