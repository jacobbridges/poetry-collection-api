    "I never thought I\u2019d keep a record of my pain",
    "or happiness",
    "like candles lighting the entire soft lace",
    "of the air",
    "around the full length of your hair/a shower",
    "organized by God",
    "in brown and auburn",
    "undulations luminous like particles",
    "of flame",
    "But now I do",
    "retrieve an afternoon of apricots",
    "and water interspersed with cigarettes",
    "and sand and rocks",
    "we walked across:",
    "How easily you held",
    "my hand",
    "beside the low tide",
    "of the world",
    "Now I do",
    "relive an evening of retreat",
    "a bridge I left behind",
    "where all the solid heat",
    "of lust and tender trembling",
    "lay as cruel and as kind",
    "as passion spins its infinite",
    "tergiversations in between the bitter",
    "and the sweet",
    "Alone and longing for you",
    "now I do"
