    "When you get in on a try you never learn it back",
    "umpteen times the tenth part of a featured world",
    "in black and in back it\u2019s roses and fostered nail",
    "bite rhyme sling slang, a song that teaches without",
    "travail of the tale, the one you longing live",
    "and singing burn",
    "It\u2019s insane to remain a trope, of a rinsing out",
    "or a ringing whatever, it\u2019s those bells that . . .",
    "and other riskier small day and fain would be",
    "of the soap a sky dares",
    "but we remand,",
    "that we a clasp of the silence you and I, all of",
    "tiny sphering rates back, I say to told wall, back",
    "and back and leave my edge, and add an L",
    "Night is so enclosed we\u2019ll never turn its page",
    "its eye, can be mine will be yours, to see all the people",
    "the underneath livid reaching part and past of the lying buildings",
    "the overreacher stops and starts, at in his head, in",
    "in her rhythm",
    "that knowledge is past all of us, so we flare and tap",
    "and top it right up, constant engage and flap in on",
    "keeping pace, our whelming rift, and soil and gleam",
    "and give back the voice, like those eary dead",
    "Step down off our whelm lessons and shortly fired",
    "enter the bristle strum of Corrosion Kingdom",
    "where the last comes by first ever ring, every",
    "race through that tunnel of sun drop and pencil",
    "in the margins of a flare, of higher wish than dare,",
    "the stroked calmings of a line will spin and chime",
    "in blue quicks of a dream blues, the chores",
    "of those whispering gone crenulations",
    "To meet a care is to dial redeem",
    "and we limp in the time sound balms",
    "so out of kilter is my name in the sun, and I win",
    "in the moon and you sing in that other spelling of win",
    "the way a blue is never singular"
