    "I sing of Morrisville",
    "(if you call this cry",
    "a song). I",
    "(if you call this painful",
    "voice by that great name)",
    "sing the poverty of my",
    "region and of",
    "the wrong end of Morrisville.",
    "You summer people will say",
    "that all its ends are wrong,",
    "but there, right there,",
    "the very end of the wrong end\u2014",
    "a house with windows sagging,",
    "leaning roadward as in defense",
    "or maybe defiance",
    "next to the granite ledge,",
    "our cliff of broken stone",
    "that shoulders our dilapidated",
    "one-lane iron bridge.",
    "Who lives here? I don\u2019t know.",
    "But they (Hermes reward them)",
    "made this extraordinary garden,",
    "geraniums,",
    "petunias and nasturtiums",
    "planted in every crevice and all",
    "the footholds of the cliff.",
    "And then",
    "they painted the cliff-face,",
    "painted the old stone; no design,",
    "just swatches of color, bold",
    "rough splashes",
    "irregularly, garish orange",
    "and livid blue. Is it",
    "fluorescent, do these stones",
    "glow in the dark?",
    "Maybe. I only know",
    "they glow in the day, so",
    "vivid I stopped my car,",
    "whereupon two others",
    "came inquiring also, two",
    "crows in the broken spars",
    "of the white pine tree, cawing",
    "above the house.",
    "Why had those who inhabited",
    "this corner of poverty",
    "painted the stones? Was it",
    "that the flowers",
    "in living bravery nevertheless",
    "made too meager a show",
    "for the ruined cliff? Or did they",
    "think to bring art",
    "to nature, somehow to improve",
    "this corner of ugliness?",
    "For my part I thought how",
    "these colors",
    "were beautiful and yet strange",
    "in their beauty, ugly colors,",
    "garish orange, livid blue;",
    "they reminded me",
    "of those Spanish cemeteries",
    "I saw in New Mexico, tin",
    "mirrors and plastic flowers",
    "in the desert. Then",
    "I knew why the stones",
    "had been painted: to make",
    "reparation, such as the poor",
    "might make, whose sorrow",
    "had been done here, this",
    "desecration. Is not this",
    "the burden of all poor lands",
    "everywhere,",
    "the basis of poverty?",
    "A spoiled land makes spoiled",
    "people. The poor know this.",
    "I guess",
    "the crows know too, because off",
    "they flew, cawing above",
    "the bridge and the slashed hills",
    "surrounding Morrisville.",
    "I started my car and drove",
    "out on the iron bridge",
    "which rumbled its sullen",
    "affirmation.",
    "And I sang as I sing now",
    "(if you care to call it song)",
    "my people of Morrisville",
    "who live",
    "where all the ends are wrong."
