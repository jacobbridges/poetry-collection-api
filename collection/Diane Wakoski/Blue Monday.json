    "Blue of the heaps of beads poured into her breasts",
    "and clacking together in her elbows;",
    "blue of the silk",
    "that covers lily-town at night;",
    "blue of her teeth",
    "that bite cold toast",
    "and shatter on the streets;",
    "blue of the dyed flower petals with gold stamens",
    "hanging like tongues",

    "a shark in the cold blue waters.",
    "You are dead: wound round like a paisley shawl.",
    "I cannot shake you out of the sheets. Your name",
    "is still wedged in every corner of the sofa.",
    "Monday is the first of the week,",
    "and I think of you all week.",
    "I beg Monday not to come",
    "so that I will not think of you",
    "all week.",
    "You paint my body blue. On the balcony",
    "in the softy muddy night, you paint me",
    "with bat wings and the crystal",
    "the crystal",
    "the crystal",

    "and my breasts, the blue of sand,",
    "and my arms, bass-blue,",
    "and my stomach, arsenic;",
    "there is electricity dripping from me like cream;",
    "there is love dripping from me I cannot use\u2014like acacia or",

    "and fedora.",
    "His glass cane, hollow and filled with",

    "of my body. At last my blood",
    "solidified and tumbling into the ocean.",
    "It is blue.",
    "It is blue.",
    "It is blue."
