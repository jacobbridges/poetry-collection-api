    "I came into the world a young man",
    "Then I broke me off",
    "Still the sea and clouds are Pegasus colors",
    "My heart is Pegasus colors but to get there I must go back",
    "Back to the time before I was a woman",
    "Before I broke me off to make a flattened lap",
    "And placed thereon a young man",
    "Where I myself could have dangled",
    "And how I begged him enter there",
    "My broken young man parts",
    "And how I let the mystery collapse",
    "With rugged young man puncture",
    "And how I begged him turn me Pegasus colors",
    "And please to put a sunset there",
    "And gone forever was my feeling snake",
    "And in its place dark letters",
    "And me the softest of all",
    "And me so skinless I could no longer be naked",
    "And me I had to de-banshee",
    "And me I dressed myself",
    "I made a poison suit",
    "I darned it out of myths",
    "Some of the myths were beautiful",
    "Some turned ugly in the making",
    "The myth of the slender girl",
    "The myth of the fat one",
    "The myth of rescue",
    "The myth of young men",
    "The myth of the hair in their eyes",
    "The myth of how beauty would save them",
    "The myth of me and who I must become",
    "The myth of what I am not",
    "And the horses who are no myth",
    "How they do not need to turn Pegasus",
    "They are winged in their un-myth",
    "They holy up the ground",
    "I must holy up the ground",
    "I sanctify the ground and say fuck it",
    "I say fuck it in a way that does not invite death",
    "I say fuck it and fall down no new holes",
    "And I ride an unwinged horse",
    "And I unbecome myself",
    "And I strip my poison suit",
    "And wear my crown of fuck its"
