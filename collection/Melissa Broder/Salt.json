    "How can you go swimming in another human being?",
    "I am swimming and asking for light.",
    "Once I paddled into dust and fucking",
    "and the horsemen and ruin",
    "and the poisonous hollows of a projected blue eye",
    "and cracked my skull on all and caught more disease",
    "in my already dread mind and entered the medicines",
    "of no human power, the forests of disappearing moans,",
    "which were rich in sap but lacked dissolve",
    "fertilized against my own swimming nature, Aleph",
    "I am swimming for you now and I don\u2019t care.",
    "When you leave the forest you do not become the ocean",
    "and I have become the desert trying to swim in the ocean",
    "and knowing this, carrying the forest floor in a sweet wood coffin",
    "and the blackbrush and rocks, the yucca and cacti of receded oceans,",
    "which were never oceans at all or there would have been shells on the sand,",
    "they only looked like oceans in my thirst, I cut the old horizon",
    "with a sword you have given and I gut the heavens",
    "and bleed their light and swim in that."
