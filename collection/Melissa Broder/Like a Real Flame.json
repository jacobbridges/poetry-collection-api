    "I want the hole in my ear to be quiet",
    "And inside the hole in my ear to be quiet",
    "And I want it to tell me what to do",
    "Or I will go to my lover\u2019s mouth",
    "And say oh my quiet",
    "I am coming",
    "And tell the quiet how its kingdom should be made",
    "Though the quiet has already eaten me",
    "Because the quiet loves me",
    "But does the lover love me",
    "And why must the quiet be so quiet",
    "And why can\u2019t the quiet have a cock",
    "And where is its violet mouth",
    "Its ten fingers with which to fix me",
    "And where is its belly breathing",
    "And O I want to be fixed",
    "But I am already fixed",
    "Why don\u2019t I feel it"
