    "The brook is this mix of roar & hiss as if God",
    "has managed to scalpel a section of tempest & clothespin it in",
    "the woods Over There Always draped in the trees",
    "while we eat white summer peaches from celadon bowls",
    "while the sun bleaches & blue jay squawks score the maple, oak",
    "birch and apple-treed sky with their oblique Scriabin musics.",
    "Fifteen years since I have seen a real Fall",
    "her deciduous burlesque, her glistering things sifting",
    "on the old cider mill. A holy show.",
    "I hold a wooden fragrance & a sodden mush of crushed",
    "flowing apples in a cache and will never give it up.",
    "The cardinal is the best bird because it is a red mark",
    "on the blank snow amid the charcoal Twombly of maple, oak",
    "birch and apple branches. Pines are green & faraway, don\u2019t figure.",
    "My sister in spring is even prettier, her smile",
    "the genuine quality of it undiminished in the many months",
    "since I have been in Happy Valley. It roars and is constantly",
    "in spate because it has its reasons spring being spring plus my visiting."
