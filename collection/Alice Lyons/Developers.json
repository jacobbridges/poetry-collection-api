    "Greed got in the way. We built a fake estate.",
    "Levinas said to see ourselves we need each other yet",
    "doorbells, rows of them, glow in the night village",
    "a string of lit invitations no elbow has leaned into",
    "(both arms embracing messages). Unanswered",
    "the doors are rotting from the bottom up.",
    "It\u2019s another perplexing pothole in our road, loves.",
    "Hard core from the quarry might make it level,",
    "hard core and cunning speculation into matters",
    "concerning love and doubt, concerning want and plenty.",
    "O the places where pavement runs out and ragwort",
    "springs up, where",
    "ends but doesn\u2019t abut",
    "anywhere neatly, a petered-out plot of Tayto",
    "tumbleweeds, bin bags, rebar, roof slates, offcuts,",
    "guttering, drain grilles, doodads, infill, gravel!",
    "A not-as-yet nice establishment, possessing potential",
    "where we have no authorized voice but are oddly fitted",
    "out for the pain it takes to build bit by bit.",
    "When the last contractions brought us to the brink",
    "of our new predicament, we became developers."
