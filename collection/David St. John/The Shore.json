    "So the tide forgets, as morning",
    "Grows too far delivered, as the bowls",
    "Of rock and wood run dry.",
    "What is left seems pearled and lit,",
    "As those cases",
    "Of the museum stood lit",
    "With milk jade, rows of opaque vases",
    "Streaked with orange and yellow smoke.",
    "You found a lavender boat, a single",
    "Figure poling upstream, baskets",
    "Of pale fish wedged between his legs.",
    "Today, the debris of winter",
    "Stands stacked against the walls,",
    "The coils of kelp lie scattered",
    "Across the floor. The oil fire",
    "Smokes. You turn down the lantern",
    "Hung on its nail. Outside,",
    "The boats aligned like sentinels.",
    "Here beside the blue depot, walking",
    "The pier, you can see the way",
    "The shore",
    "Approximates the dream, how distances",
    "Repeat their deaths",
    "Above these tables and panes of water\u2014",
    "As climbing the hills above",
    "The harbor, up to the lupine drifting",
    "Among the lichen-masked pines,",
    "The night is pocked with lamps lit",
    "On every boat offshore,",
    "Galleries of floating stars. Below,",
    "On its narrow tracks shelved",
    "Into the cliff\u2019s face,",
    "The train begins its slide down",
    "To the warehouses by the harbor. Loaded",
    "With diesel, coal, paychecks, whiskey,",
    "Bedsheets, slabs of ice\u2014for the fish,",
    "For the men. You lean on my arm,",
    "As once",
    "I watched you lean at the window;",
    "The bookstalls below stretched a mile",
    "To the quay, the afternoon crowd",
    "Picking over the novels and histories.",
    "You walked out as you walked out last",
    "Night, onto the stone porch. Dusk",
    "Reddened the walls, the winds sliced",
    "Off the reefs. The vines of the gourds",
    "Shook on their lattice. You talked",
    "About that night you stood",
    "Behind the black pane of the French",
    "Window, watching my father read some long",
    "Passage",
    "Of a famous voyager\u2019s book. You hated",
    "That voice filling the room,",
    "Its light. So tonight we make a soft",
    "Parenthesis upon the sand\u2019s black bed.",
    "In that dream we share, there is",
    "One shore, where we look out upon nothing",
    "And the sea our whole lives;",
    "Until turning from those waves, we find",
    "One shore, where we look out upon nothing",
    "And the earth our whole lives.",
    "Where what is left between shore and sky",
    "Is traced in the vague wake of",
    "(The stars, the sandpipers whistling)",
    "What we forgive."
