    "I saw my mother standing there below me",
    "On the narrow bank just looking out over the river",
    "Looking at something just beyond the taut middle rope",
    "Of the braided swirling currents",
    "Then she looked up quite suddenly to the far bank",
    "Where the densely twined limbs of the cypress",
    "Twisted violently toward the storm-struck sky",
    "There are some things we know before we know",
    "Also some things we wish we would not ever know",
    "Even if as children we already knew",
    "so",
    "Standing above her on that bridge that shuddered",
    "Each time the river ripped at its wooden pilings",
    "I knew I could never even fate willing ever",
    "Get to her in time"
