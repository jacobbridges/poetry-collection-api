    "The way a tired Chippewa woman",
    "Who\u2019s lost a child gathers up black feathers,",
    "Black quills & leaves",
    "That she wraps & swaddles in a little bale, a shag",
    "Cocoon she carries with her & speaks to always",
    "As if it were the child,",
    "Until she knows the soul has grown fat & clever,",
    "That the child can find its own way at last;",
    "Well, I go everywhere",
    "Picking the dust out of the dust, scraping the breezes",
    "Up off the floor, & gather them into a doll",
    "Of you, to touch at the nape of the neck, to slip",
    "Under my shirt like a rag\u2014the way",
    "Another man\u2019s wallet rides above his heart. As you",
    "Cry out, as if calling to a father you conjure",
    "In the paling light, the voice rises, instead, in me.",
    "Nothing stops it, the crying. Not the clove of moon,",
    "Not the woman raking my back with her words. Our letters",
    "Close. Sometimes, you ask",
    "About the world; sometimes, I answer back. Nights",
    "Return you to me for a while, as sleep returns sleep",
    "To a landscape ravaged",
    "& familiar. The dark watermark of your absence, a hush."
