    "Who shall invoke her, who shall be her priest,",
    "With single rites the common debt to pay?",
    "On some green headland fronting to the East",
    "Our fairest boy shall kneel at break of day.",
    "Naked, uplifting in a laden tray",
    "New milk and honey and sweet-tinctured wine,",
    "Not without twigs of clustering apple-spray",
    "To wreath a garland for Our Lady's shrine.",
    "The morning planet poised above the sea",
    "Shall drop sweet influence through her drowsing lid;",
    "Dew-drenched, his delicate virginity",
    "Shall scarce disturb the flowers he kneels amid,",
    "That, waked so lightly, shall lift up their eyes,",
    "Cushion his knees, and nod between his thighs."
