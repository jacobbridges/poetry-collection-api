    "Four weeks in, quarreling and far",
    "from home, we came to the loneliest place.",
    "A western railroad town. Remember?",
    "I left you at the campsite with greasy pans",
    "and told our children not to follow me.",
    "The dying light had made me desperate.",
    "I broke into a hobbled run, across tracks,",
    "past warehouses with sun-blanked windows",
    "to where a playground shone in a wooded clearing.",
    "Then I was swinging, out over treetops.",
    "I saw myself never going back, yet",
    "whatever breathed in the mute woods",
    "was not another life. The sun sank.",
    "I let the swing die, my toes scuffed earth,",
    "and I was rocked into remembrance",
    "of the girl who had dreamed the life I had.",
    "Through night, dark at the root, I returned to it."
