    "And medical help, dispatchers",
    "Picking up for thousands who thought,",

    "With the calm voices of the dead.",
    "Cautions? Disclaimers? Those callers,",
    "Regardless, asked about heaven's",
    "Lifestyle, what it meant to be dead.",
    "They chanted incantations to",
    "Ward off whatever might travel",

    "Asked for help with the lottery\u2014",
    "Because surely the selfless dead",
    "Knew the winning numbers, the sort",
    "Of thing you heard in paradise."
