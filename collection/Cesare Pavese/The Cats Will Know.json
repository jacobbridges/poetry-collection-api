    "Rain will fall again",
    "on your smooth pavement,",
    "a light rain like",
    "a breath or a step.",
    "The breeze and the dawn",
    "will flourish again",
    "when you return,",

    "there will be other voices.",
    "You will smile alone.",
    "The cats will know.",
    "You will hear words",
    "old and spent and useless",
    "like costumes left over",
    "from yesterday\u2019s parties.",
    "You too will make gestures.",

    "and the light rain",
    "and the hyacinth dawn",
    "that wrench the heart of him",
    "who hopes no more for you\u2014",
    "they are the sad smile",
    "you smile by yourself.",
    "There will be other days,",
    "other voices and renewals.",
    "Face of springtime,",
    "we will suffer at daybreak."
