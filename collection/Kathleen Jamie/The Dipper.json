    "It was winter, near freezing,",
    "I'd walked through a forest of firs",
    "when I saw issue out of the waterfall",
    "a solitary bird.",
    "It lit on a damp rock,",
    "and, as water swept stupidly on,",
    "wrung from its own throat",
    "supple, undammable song.",
    "It isn't mine to give.",
    "I can't coax this bird to my hand",
    "that knows the depth of the river",
    "yet sings of it on land."
