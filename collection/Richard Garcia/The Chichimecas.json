    "and they are holding rags soaked with paint spray",
    "to their noses. This makes the moon come down.",

    "mommy, chant the Chichimecas",
    "as they fall asleep in a pile with their many dogs.",
    "mommy as they snore and dream that the stars",
    "are dripping milk into their open mouths."
