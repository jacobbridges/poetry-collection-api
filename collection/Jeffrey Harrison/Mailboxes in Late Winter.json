    "It\u2019s a motley lot. A few still stand",
    "at attention like sentries at the ends",
    "of their driveways, but more lean",
    "askance as if they\u2019d just received a blow",
    "to the head, and in fact they\u2019ve received",
    "many, all winter, from jets of wet snow",
    "shooting off the curved, tapered blade",
    "of the plow. Some look wobbly, cocked",
    "at oddball angles or slumping forlornly",
    "on precariously listing posts. One box",
    "bows steeply forward, as if in disgrace, its door",
    "lolling sideways, unhinged. Others are dented,",
    "battered, streaked with rust, bandaged in duct tape,",
    "crisscrossed with clothesline or bungee cords.",
    "A few lie abashed in remnants of the very snow",
    "that knocked them from their perches.",
    "Another is wedged in the crook of a tree",
    "like a birdhouse, its post shattered nearby.",
    "I almost feel sorry for them, worn out",
    "by the long winter, off-kilter, not knowing",
    "what hit them, trying to hold themselves",
    "together, as they wait for news from spring."
