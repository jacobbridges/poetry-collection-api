    "\u201cSo this is it, experience,\u201d I thought,",
    "lugging tin buckets from the ice machines",
    "to rooms of real adults with cigarettes,",
    "mixed drinks in plastic cups, and proffered coins.",
    "I reached out for their blessings, but the tips",
    "were nothing next to rumpled, unmade beds",
    "at four in the afternoon, women in slips",
    "and men in t-shirts while the TV played.",
    "Down in the laundry room, I counted sheets,",
    "stunned by the musk that vanished in the wash,",
    "and balled up soggy towels that down the chutes",
    "exploded in bins. Before the evening rush,",
    "avid and timid for what I glimpsed at work,",
    "I left, hanging my gold vest on a hook."
