    "\u201cI order you to operate, I was not made to suffer.\u201d",
    "Probing for old wills, and friendships, for to free",
    "to New York City, to be in History, New York City being",
    "History at that time.\u201d \u201cAnd I traded my nights",
    "for Intensity; & I barter my right to Gold; & I\u2019d traded",
    "my eyes much earlier, when I was circa say seven years old",
    "for ears to hear Who was speaking, & just exactly who",
    "was being told\u2026.\u201d & I\u2019m glad",
    "I hear your words so clearly",
    "& I would not have done it",
    "differently",
    "& I\u2019m amused at such simplicity, even so,",
    "inside each & every door. And now I\u2019m with you, instantly,",
    "& I\u2019ll see you tomorrow night, and I see you constantly, hopefully",
    "though one or the other of us is often, to the body-mind\u2019s own self",
    "more or less out of sight! Taking walks down any streets, High",
    "Street, Main Street, walk past my doors! Newtown; Nymph Rd",
    "(on the Mesa); Waveland",
    "Meeting House Lane, in old Southampton; or BelleVue Road",
    "in England, etcetera",
    "Other roads; Manhattan; see them there where open or shut up behind",
    "\u201cI\u2019ve traded sweet lines for answers \u2026\u201d",
    "They don\u2019t serve me anymore.\u201d They still serve me on the floor.",
    "Or,",
    "as now, as floor. Now we look out the windows, go in &",
    "out the doors. The Door.",
    "(That front door which was but & then at that time My door).",
    "I closed it",
    "On the wooing of Helen. \u201cAnd so we left schools for her.\u201d For",
    "She is not one bit fiction; & she is easy to see;",
    "& she leaves me small room",
    "For contradiction. And she is not alone; & she is not one bit",
    "lonely in the large high room, &",
    "invention is just vanity, which is plain. She",
    "is the heart\u2019s own body, the body\u2019s own mind in itself",
    "self-contained.",
    "& she talks like you; & she has created truly not single-handedly",
    "Our tragic thing, America. And though I would be I am not afraid",
    "of her, & you also not. You, yourself, I,",
    "Me, myself, me. And no, we certainly have not pulled down",
    "our vanity: but",

    "rarely fail to remember, although we write seldom, & so must seem",
    "gone forever.",
    "In the stained sky over this morning the clouds seem about to burst",
    "What is being remembering",
    "Is how we are, together. Like you we are always bothered, except",
    "by the worst; & we are living",
    "as with you we also were",
    "fired, only, mostly, by changes in the weather. For Oh dear hearts,",
    "When precious baby blows her fuse / it\u2019s just our way",
    "of keeping amused.",
    "That we offer of & as excuse. Here\u2019s to you. All the very best.",
    "What\u2019s your pleasure? Cheers."
