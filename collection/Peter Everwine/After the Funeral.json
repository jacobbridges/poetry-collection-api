    "We opened closets and bureau drawers",
    "and packed away, in boxes, dresses and shoes,",
    "the silk underthings still wrapped in tissue.",
    "We sorted through cedar chests. We gathered",
    "and set aside the keepsakes and the good silver",
    "and brought up from the coal cellar",
    "jars of tomato sauce, peppers, jellied fruit.",
    "We dismantled, we took down from the walls,",
    "we bundled and carted off and swept clean.",
    "Goodbye, goodbye, we said, closing",
    "the door behind us, going our separate ways",
    "from the house we had emptied,",
    "and which, in the coming days, we would fill",
    "again and empty and try to fill again."
