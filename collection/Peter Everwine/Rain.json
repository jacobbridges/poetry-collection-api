    "Toward evening, as the light failed",
    "and the pear tree at my window darkened,",
    "I put down my book and stood at the open door,",
    "the first raindrops gusting in the eaves,",
    "a smell of wet clay in the wind.",
    "Sixty years ago, lying beside my father,",
    "half asleep, on a bed of pine boughs as rain",
    "drummed against our tent, I heard",
    "for the first time a loon\u2019s sudden wail",
    "drifting across that remote lake\u2014",
    "a loneliness like no other,",
    "though what I heard as inconsolable",
    "may have been only the sound of something",
    "untamed and nameless",
    "singing itself to the wilderness around it",
    "and to us until we slept. And thinking of my father",
    "and of good companions gone",
    "into oblivion, I heard the steady sound of rain",
    "and the soft lapping of water, and did not know",
    "whether it was grief or joy or something other",
    "that surged against my heart",
    "and held me listening there so long and late."
