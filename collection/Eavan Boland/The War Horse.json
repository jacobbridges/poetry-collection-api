    "This dry night, nothing unusual",
    "About the clip, clop, casual",
    "Iron of his shoes as he stamps death",
    "Like a mint on the innocent coinage of earth.",
    "I lift the window, watch the ambling feather",
    "Of hock and fetlock, loosed from its daily tether",
    "In the tinker camp on the Enniskerry Road,",
    "Pass, his breath hissing, his snuffling head",
    "Down. He is gone. No great harm is done.",
    "Only a leaf of our laurel hedge is torn\u2014",
    "Of distant interest like a maimed limb,",
    "Only a rose which now will never climb",
    "The stone of our house, expendable, a mere",
    "Line of defence against him, a volunteer",
    "You might say, only a crocus, its bulbous head",
    "Blown from growth, one of the screamless dead.",
    "But we, we are safe, our unformed fear",
    "Of fierce commitment gone; why should we care",
    "If a rose, a hedge, a crocus are uprooted",
    "Like corpses, remote, crushed, mutilated?",
    "He stumbles on like a rumour of war, huge",
    "Threatening. Neighbours use the subterfuge",
    "Of curtains. He stumbles down our short street",
    "Thankfully passing us. I pause, wait,",
    "Then to breathe relief lean on the sill",
    "And for a second only my blood is still",
    "With atavism. That rose he smashed frays",
    "Ribboned across our hedge, recalling days",
    "Of burned countryside, illicit braid:",
    "A cause ruined before, a world betrayed."
