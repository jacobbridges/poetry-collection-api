    "silence to its edge and you will hear",

    "a fieldfare or thrush written on it.",
    "The other history is silent: The estuary",

    "and grow dark and then darker, then",
    "you will know that the nature poem",
    "is not the action nor its end: it is",
    "this rust on the gate beside the trees, on",
    "the cattle grid underneath our feet,",
    "on the steering wheel shaft: it is",
    "an aftermath, an overlay and even in",
    "its own modest way, an art of peace:",
    "I try the word",
    "and it fills with",
    "sycamores, a summer's worth of pollen",

    "to those ilex trees half in, half out",
    "of shadows falling on the shallow ford",
    "of the south bank beside Yellow Island",
    "as twilight shows how this sweet corrosion",
    "begins to be complete: what we see",
    "is what the poem says:",
    "evening coming\u2014cattle, cattle-shadows\u2014",
    "and whin bushes and a change of weather",
    "about to change them all: what we see is how",
    "the place and the torment of the place are",
    "for this moment free of one another."
