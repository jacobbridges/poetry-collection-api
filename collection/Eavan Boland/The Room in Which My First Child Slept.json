    "After a while I thought of it this way:",
    "It was a town underneath a mountain",
    "crowned by snow and every year a river",
    "rushed through, enveloping the dusk",
    "in a noise everyone knew signaled spring\u2014",
    "a small town, known for a kind of calico,",
    "made there, strong and unglazed,",
    "a makeshift of cotton in which the actual",
    "unseparated husks still remained and",
    "could be found if you looked behind",
    "the coarse daisies and the red-billed bird",
    "with swept-back wings always trying to",
    "arrive safely on the inch or so of cotton it",
    "might have occupied if anyone had offered it.",
    "And if you ask me now what happened to it\u2014",

    "how to explain that sometimes I can hear",
    "the river in those first days of April, making",
    "its way through the dusk, having learned",
    "to speak the way I once spoke, saying"
