    "One afternoon of summer rain",
    "my hand skimmed a shelf and I found",
    "an old florin. Ireland, 1950.",
    "We say",
    "or",
    "and the world is",
    "a fish minted in silver and alloy,",
    "an outing for all the children,",
    "an evening in the Sandford cinema,",
    "a paper cone of lemonade crystals and",
    "say it again so we can see",
    "androgyny of angels, edges to a circle,",
    "the way the body works against the possible\u2014",
    "and no one to tell us, now or ever,",
    "why it ends, why",
    "it always ends.",
    "I am holding",
    "two whole shillings of nothing,",
    "observing its heaviness, its uselessness.",
    "And how in the cool shadow of nowhere",
    "a salmon leaps up to find a weir",
    "it could not even know",
    "was never there."
