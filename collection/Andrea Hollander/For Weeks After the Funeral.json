    "The house felt like the opera,",
    "the audience in their seats, hushed, ready,",
    "but the cast not yet arrived.",
    "And if I said anything",
    "to try to appease the anxious air, my words",
    "would hang alone like the single chandelier",
    "waiting to dim the auditorium, but still",
    "too huge, too prominent, too bright, its light",
    "announcing only itself, bringing more",
    "emptiness into the emptiness."
