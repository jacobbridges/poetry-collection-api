    "Possessed of this city, we are born",
    "Into kinship with its people.",
    "Eyes that looked upon",
    "Cool magnificence of space,",
    "The calm of marble,",
    "And green converging on green",
    "In long distances,",
    "Bear their wonder to refute",
    "Meaningless dimensions,",
    "The Old-World facades.",
    "The city is ours irrevocably",
    "As pain sprouts at the edge of joy,",
    "As grief grows large with our years.",
    "New seeds push hard to topsoil;",
    "Logic is a grafted flower",
    "From roots in a changeless bed.",
    "Skeleton steel may shadow the path,",
    "Broken stone snag the foot,",
    "But we shall walk again",
    "Side by side with others on the street,",
    "Each certain of his way home."
