    "Abortions will not let you forget.",
    "You remember the children you got that you did not get,",
    "The damp small pulps with a little or with no hair,",
    "The singers and workers that never handled the air.",
    "You will never neglect or beat",
    "Them, or silence or buy with a sweet.",
    "You will never wind up the sucking-thumb",
    "Or scuttle off ghosts that come.",
    "You will never leave them, controlling your luscious sigh,",
    "Return for a snack of them, with gobbling mother-eye.",
    "I have heard in the voices of the wind the voices of my dim killed children.",
    "I have contracted. I have eased",
    "My dim dears at the breasts they could never suck.",
    "I have said, Sweets, if I sinned, if I seized",
    "Your luck",
    "And your lives from your unfinished reach,",
    "If I stole your births and your names,",
    "Your straight baby tears and your games,",
    "Your stilted or lovely loves, your tumults, your marriages, aches, and your deaths,",
    "If I poisoned the beginnings of your breaths,",
    "Believe that even in my deliberateness I was not deliberate.",
    "Though why should I whine,",
    "Whine that the crime was other than mine?\u2014",
    "Since anyhow you are dead.",
    "Or rather, or instead,",
    "You were never made.",
    "But that too, I am afraid,",
    "Is faulty: oh, what shall I say, how is the truth to be said?",
    "You were born, you had body, you died.",
    "It is just that you never giggled or planned or cried.",
    "Believe me, I loved you all.",
    "Believe me, I knew you, though faintly, and I loved, I loved you",
    "All."
