    "He waits a moment, he designs his reign,",
    "That no performance may be plain or vain.",
    "Then rises in a clear delirium.",
    "He sheds, with his pajamas, shabby days.",
    "And his desertedness, his intricate fear, the",
    "Postponed resentments and the prim precautions.",
    "Now, at his bath, would you deny him lavender",
    "Or take away the power of his pine?",
    "What smelly substitute, heady as wine,",

    "There must be scent, somehow there must be some.",
    "Would you have flowers in his life? suggest",
    "Asters? a Really Good geranium?",

    "Magnificence, poinsettias, and emphatic",
    "Red of prize roses? might his happiest",
    "Alternative (you muse) be, after all,",
    "A bit of gentle garden in the best",
    "Of taste and straight tradition? Maybe so.",
    "But you forget, or did you ever know,",
    "His heritage of cabbage and pigtails,",
    "Old intimacy with alleys, garbage pails,",
    "Down in the deep (but always beautiful) South",
    "Where roses blush their blithest (it is said)",
    "And sweet magnolias put Chanel to shame.",
    "No! He has not a flower to his name.",
    "Except a feather one, for his lapel.",
    "Apart from that, if he should think of flowers",
    "It is in terms of dandelions or death.",

    "With his meticulous and serious love,",
    "The innards of this closet. Which is a vault",
    "Whose glory is not diamonds, not pearls,",
    "Not silver plate with just enough dull shine.",
    "But wonder-suits in yellow and in wine,",
    "Sarcastic green and zebra-striped cobalt.",

    "Then they receive the brave and beautiful",
    "Embrace of some of that equivocal wool.",

    "The neat curve here; the angularity",
    "That is appropriate at just its place;",
    "The technique of a variegated grace.",
    "Here is all his sculpture and his art",
    "And all his architectural design.",

    "Passes to coffee and a roll or two.",
    "Has breakfasted.",
    "Out. Sounds about him smear,",
    "Become a unit. He hears and does not hear",
    "The alarm clock meddling in somebody\u2019s sleep;",

    "He sees and does not see the broken windows",
    "Hiding their shame with newsprint; little girl",
    "With ribbons decking wornness, little boy",
    "Wearing the trousers with the decentest patch,",
    "To honor Sunday; women on their way",
    "From \u201cservice,\u201d temperate holiness arranged",
    "Ably on asking faces; men estranged",
    "From music and from wonder and from joy",
    "But far familiar with the guiding awe",
    "Of foodlessness.",

    "Restaurant vendors",
    "Weep, or out of them rolls a restless glee.",
    "The Lonesome Blues, the Long-lost Blues, I Want A",
    "Big Fat Mama. Down these sore avenues",
    "Comes no Saint-Sa\u00ebns, no piquant elusive Grieg,",
    "And not Tschaikovsky\u2019s wayward eloquence",
    "And not the shapely tender drift of Brahms.",
    "But could he love them? Since a man must bring",
    "To music what his mother spanked him for",
    "When he was two: bits of forgotten hate,",
    "Devotion: whether or not his mattress hurts:",
    "The little dream his father humored: the thing",
    "His sister did for money: what he ate",

    "But movie-time approaches, time to boo",
    "The hero\u2019s kiss, and boo the heroine",
    "Whose ivory and yellow it is sin",
