    "Ugliest little boy",
    "that everyone ever saw.",
    "That is what everyone said.",
    "Even to his mother it was apparent\u2014",
    "when the blue-aproned nurse came into the",
    "northeast end of the maternity ward",
    "bearing his squeals and plump bottom",
    "looped up in a scant receiving blanket,",
    "bending, to pass the bundle carefully",
    "into the waiting mother-hands\u2014that this",
    "was no cute little ugliness, no sly baby waywardness",
    "that was going to inch away",
    "as would baby fat, baby curl, and",
    "baby spot-rash. The pendulous lip, the",
    "branching ears, the eyes so wide and wild,",
    "the vague unvibrant brown of the skin,",
    "and, most disturbing, the great head.",
    "These components of That Look bespoke",
    "the sure fibre. The deep grain.",
    "His father could not bear the sight of him.",
    "His mother high-piled her pretty dyed hair and",
    "put him among her hairpins and sweethearts,",
    "dance slippers, torn paper roses.",
    "He was not less than these,",
    "he was not more.",
    "As the little Lincoln grew,",
    "uglily upward and out, he began",
    "to understand that something was",
    "wrong. His little ways of trying",
    "to please his father, the bringing",
    "of matches, the jumping aside at",
    "warning sound of oh-so-large and",
    "rushing stride, the smile that gave",
    "and gave and gave\u2014Unsuccessful!",
    "Even Christmases and Easters were spoiled.",
    "He would be sitting at the",
    "family feasting table, really",
    "delighting in the displays of mashed potatoes",
    "and the rich golden",
    "fat-crust of the ham or the festive",
    "fowl, when he would look up and find",
    "somebody feeling indignant about him.",
    "What a pity what a pity. No love",
    "for one so loving. The little Lincoln",
    "loved Everybody. Ants. The changing",
    "caterpillar. His much-missing mother.",
    "His kindergarten teacher.",
    "His kindergarten teacher\u2014whose",
    "concern for him was composed of one",
    "part sympathy and two parts repulsion.",
    "The others ran up with their little drawings.",
    "He ran up with his.",
    "She",
    "tried to be as pleasant with him as",
    "with others, but it was difficult.",
    "For she was all pretty! all daintiness,",
    "all tiny vanilla, with blue eyes and fluffy",
    "sun-hair. One afternoon she",
    "saw him in the hall looking bleak against",
    "the wall. It was strange because the",
    "bell had long since rung and no other",
    "child was in sight. Pity flooded her.",
    "She buttoned her gloves and suggested",
    "cheerfully that she walk him home. She",
    "started out bravely, holding him by the",
    "hand. But she had not walked far before",
    "she regretted it. The little monkey.",
    "Must everyone look? And clutching her",
    "hand like that. . . . Literally pinching",
    "it. . . .",
    "At seven, the little Lincoln loved",
    "the brother and sister who",
    "moved next door. Handsome. Well-",
    "dressed. Charitable, often, to him. They",
    "enjoyed him because he was",
    "resourceful, made up",
    "games, told stories. But when",
    "their More Acceptable friends came they turned",
    "their handsome backs on him. He",
    "hated himself for his feeling",
    "of well-being when with them despite\u2014",
    "Everything.",
    "He spent much time looking at himself",
    "in mirrors. What could be done?",
    "But there was no",
    "shrinking his head. There was no",
    "binding his ears.",
    "\u201cDon\u2019t touch me!\u201d cried the little",
    "fairy-like being in the playground.",
    "Her name was Nerissa. The many",
    "children were playing tag, but when",
    "he caught her, she recoiled, jerked free",
    "and ran. It was like all the",
    "rainbow that ever was, going off",
    "forever, all, all the sparklings in",
    "the sunset west.",
    "One day, while he was yet seven,",
    "a thing happened. In the down-town movies",
    "with his mother a white",
    "man in the seat beside him whispered",
    "loudly to a companion, and pointed at",
    "the little Linc.",
    "\u201cTHERE! That\u2019s the kind I\u2019ve been wanting",
    "to show you! One of the best",
    "examples of the specie. Not like",
    "those diluted Negroes you see so much of on",
    "the streets these days, but the",
    "real thing.",
    "Black, ugly, and odd. You",
    "can see the savagery. The blunt",
    "blankness. That is the real",
    "thing.\u201d",
    "His mother\u2014her hair had never looked so",
    "red around the dark brown",
    "velvet of her face\u2014jumped up,",
    "shrieked \u201cGo to\u2014\u201d She did not finish.",
    "She yanked to his feet the little",
    "Lincoln, who was sitting there",
    "staring in fascination at his assessor. At the author of his",
    "new idea.",
    "All the way home he was happy. Of course,",
    "he had not liked the word",
    "\u201cugly.\u201d",
    "But, after all, should he not",
    "be used to that by now? What had",
    "struck him, among words and meanings",
    "he could little understand, was the phrase",
    "\u201cthe real thing.\u201d",
    "He didn\u2019t know quite why,",
    "but he liked that.",
    "He liked that very much.",
    "When he was hurt, too much",
    "stared at\u2014",
    "too much",
    "left alone\u2014he",
    "thought about that. He told himself",
    "\u201cAfter all, I\u2019m",
    "the real thing.\u201d",
    "It comforted him."
