    "Already I am no longer looked at with lechery or love.",
    "My daughters and sons have put me away with marbles and dolls,",
    "Are gone from the house.",
    "My husband and lovers are pleasant or somewhat polite",
    "And night is night.",
    "It is a real chill out,",
    "The genuine thing.",
    "I am not deceived, I do not think it is still summer",
    "Because sun stays and birds continue to sing.",
    "It is summer-gone that I see, it is summer-gone.",
    "The sweet flowers indrying and dying down,",
    "The grasses forgetting their blaze and consenting to brown.",
    "It is a real chill out. The fall crisp comes.",
    "I am aware there is winter to heed.",
    "There is no warm house",
    "That is fitted with my need.",
    "I am cold in this cold house this house",
    "Whose washed echoes are tremulous down lost halls.",
    "I am a woman, and dusty, standing among new affairs.",
    "I am a woman who hurries through her prayers.",
    "Tin intimations of a quiet core to be my",
    "Desert and my dear relief",
    "Come: there shall be such islanding from grief,",
    "And small communion with the master shore.",
    "Twang they. And I incline this ear to tin,",
    "Consult a dual dilemma. Whether to dry",
    "In humming pallor or to leap and die.",
    "Somebody muffed it? Somebody wanted to joke."
