    "Do nothing and everything will be done,",
    "that's what Mr. Lao Tzu said, who walked",
    "around talking 2,500 years ago and",
    "now his books practically grow on trees",
    "they're so popular and if he were",
    "alive today beautiful women would",
    "rush up to him like waves lapping",
    "at the shores of his wisdom.",
    "That's the way it is, I guess: humbling.",
    "But if I could just unclench my fists,",
    "empty out my eyes, turn my mind into",
    "a prayer flag for the wind to play with,",
    "we could be brothers, him the older one",
    "who's seen and not done it all and me",
    "still unlearning, both of us slung low",
    "in our hammocks, our hats tipped",
    "forwards, hands folded neatly,",
    "like bamboo huts, above our hearts."
