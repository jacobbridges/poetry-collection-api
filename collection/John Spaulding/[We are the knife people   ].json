    "We are the knife people, iron men, coat people",

    "and keepers of kettle and scummer, word",
    "scratchers, corn stealers and bad sleepers.",
    "As if towns could build themselves.",
    "As if stumps jumped from the ground or",
    "flesh of beasts fell into trenchers.",
    "As if paradise prevailed on earth.",
    "To come to rich moulds and lush plantings,",
    "long-necked trees and tongues of land,",

    "To reck not the peril.",
    "Suffering snakes that may fly, wolves",
    "that may ravish. Kingdom",
    "of sachem and sagamore.",
    "Kingdom of corn and thorny promise.",
    "To satisfy our appetite of spirit,",
    "our thirst of property.",
    "To seek not the opera of war but",
    "belittled by the possibilities",
    "to stand silenced by the task before us\u2014",
    "these be my sudden and undigested thoughts."
