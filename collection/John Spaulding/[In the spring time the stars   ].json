    "In the spring time the stars began looking for him",
    "By summer time they had found him",
    "By autumn time they had wounded him",
    "so that the orange and red of his blood began",
    "to leak from the sky onto the leaves of the trees",
    "By winter time they had slain him",
    "so that his white fat began to melt and drip",
    "falling as snow all over the land",
    "And then he would begin to rise again",
    "first as sap in the trees",
    "stretching higher and higher",
    "until his back ached but",
    "knowing he would not stop until",
    "his black fur was hidden",
    "deep among the unborn",
    "behind the dark wall of the night sky"
