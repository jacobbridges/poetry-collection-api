    "I love you as a sheriff searches for a walnut",
    "That will solve a murder case unsolved for years",
    "Because the murderer left it in the snow beside a window",
    "Through which he saw her head, connecting with",
    "Her shoulders by a neck, and laid a red",
    "Roof in her heart. For this we live a thousand years;",
    "For this we love, and we live because we love, we are not",
    "Inside a bottle, thank goodness! I love you as a",
    "Kid searches for a goat; I am crazier than shirttails",
    "In the wind, when you\u2019re near, a wind that blows from",

    "Of a ship which sails",
    "From Hartford to Miami, and I love you",
    "Best at dawn, when even before I am awake the sun",
    "Receives me in the questions which you always pose."
