    "Is the governor falling",
    "From a great height?",
    "Arm in arm we fled the brassiere factory,",
    "The motion-boat stayed on the shore!",
    "I saw how round its bottom was",
    "As you walked into southern France\u2014",
    "Upon the light hair of an arm",
    "Cigar bands lay!",
    "I kissed you then. Oh is my bar",
    "The insect of your will? The water rose,",
    "But will the buffalo on",
    "The nickel yet be still?",
    "For how can windows hold out the light",
    "In your eyes!",
    "Darling, we fled the brassiere factory",
    "In forty-eight states,",
    "Arm in arm,",
    "When human beings hung on us",
    "And you had been arrested by the cloths",
    "Were used in making, and I said, \u201cThe Goths",
    "Know such delight,\u201d but still we fled, away",
    "Into a dinner atmosphere",
    "From all we knew, and fall asleep this day.",
    "O maintenance men, with cruel eyes,",
    "Then arm in arm we fled the listless factory!",
    "The music changed your fingers\u2019 ends to pearl,",
    "I punched you, you foolish girl,",
    "For thanks to the metronome we got out alive, in the air",
    "Where the sun filled us with cruelty!",
    "There\u2019s what to do",
    "Except despair, like pages! and laugh",
    "Like prawns, about the sea!",
    "Oh arm in arm we fled the industry",
    "Into an earth of banks",
    "And foolish tanks, for what bare breasts might be."
