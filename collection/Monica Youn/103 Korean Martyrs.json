    "Where was it that we went that night?",
    "That long, low building: floodlights",
    "rimmed in lavender, the moon ringed",
    "in rose. I would rather, then, have stayed",
    "outside, where spiderwebs glowed",
    "like jellyfish in the damp yew hedges,",
    "where the paths were chalky pebbles",
    "set with giant stepping stones.",
    "But the film was starting. In the air-",
    "conditioned dark, a crowd of strangers,",
    "strange families (not from our church)",
    "in rows of metal folding chairs to see",
    "a man quartered by horses: strain",
    "stitched across his shining back",
    "then, all over at once, an unraveling",
    "and then the spill of meat;",
    "a girl pushed through a doorway,",
    "naked among soldiers:",
    "she grew a dress to cover herself,",
    "a blue dress with a blinding sash."
