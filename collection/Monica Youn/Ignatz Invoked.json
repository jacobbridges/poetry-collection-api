    "A gauze bandage wraps the land",
    "and is unwound, stained orange with sulfates.",
    "A series of slaps molds a mountain,",
    "a fear uncoils itself, testing its long",
    "cool limbs. A passing cloud",
    "seizes up like a carburetor",
    "and falls to earth, lies broken-",
    "backed and lidless in the scree.",
    "Acetylene torches now snug",
    "in their holsters, shop-vacs",
    "trundled back behind the dawn.",
    "A mist becomes a murmur, becomes",
    "a moan deepening the dust-",
    "choked fissures in the rock",
    "Ignatz O come to us by moonlight",
    "O arch your speckled body over the earth."
