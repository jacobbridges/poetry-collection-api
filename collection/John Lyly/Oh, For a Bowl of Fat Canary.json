    "Oh, for a bowl of fat Canary,",
    "Rich Palermo, sparkling Sherry,",
    "Some nectar else, from Juno\u2019s dairy;",
    "Oh, these draughts would make us merry!",
    "Oh, for a wench (I deal in faces,",
    "And in other daintier things);",
    "Tickled am I with her embraces,",
    "Fine dancing in such fairy rings.",
    "Oh, for a plump fat leg of mutton,",
    "Veal, lamb, capon, pig, and coney;",
    "None is happy but a glutton,",
    "None an ass but who wants money.",
    "Wines indeed and girls are good,",
    "But brave victuals feast the blood;",
    "For wenches, wine, and lusty cheer,",
    "Jove would leap down to surfeit here."
