    "My body, laid out on a marble slab.",
    "Naked but for a linen sheet tucked under",
    "Its chin, as though to keep the patient warm.",
    "A solemn band approached; identified",
    "The late departed with what looked like mingled",
    "Relief, mild satisfaction, and bereavement.",
    "One of them took away an arm\u0097the right,",
    "Was it?\u0097and loped off with a spring in his step.",
    "Which prompted others to do likewise: here",
    "A shoulder (suitable for crying on),",
    "there a foot, there an eye and there an ear.",
    "Plump already, one scooped out the belly.",
    "Just who you\u2019d imagine claimed the head.",
    "Not the one I hoped tugged loose a rib.",
    "Some, by no means all, I knew as friends;",
    "But felt no bitterness, instead, acceptance.",
    "This, while watching their several withdrawals,",
    "Travelers moving farther out and deeper",
    "Into the ringing distance\u0097who all began",
    "To flourish, somehow more intently themselves",
    "Than they had earlier resolved to be.",
    "Was glad of that, despite a fit of shivers",
    "(Simple human nature still presiding)",
    "When I took note of the rummage that remained,",
    "Wishing a greener plot had been marked out",
    "For what had breathed with so much spark and promise.",
    "My turn, then, to come forward for a closer",
    "Look; and, since no one else had carried off",
    "That steady, flexibly strung pump at rest",
    "Beneath the sternum, take it for my own,",
    "Sensing its mute but anchored trust that parts",
    "Lucky for others would befriend as well\u0097",
    "\u0097even the heir that flesh once named."
