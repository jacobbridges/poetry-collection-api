    "Loaf after loaf, in several sizes,",
    "and never does it not look fresh,",
    "as though its insides weren\u2019t moist",
    "or warm crust not the kind that spices",
    "a room with the plump aroma of toast.",
    "Found on the table; among shadows",
    "next to the kitchen phone; dispatched",
    "FedEx (without return address, though).",
    "Someone, possibly more than one",
    "person, loves me. Well then, who?",
    "Amazing that bread should be so weightless,",
    "down-light when handled, as a me",
    "dying to taste it takes a slice.",
    "Which lasts just long enough to reach",
    "my mouth, but then, at the first bite,",
    "Nothing! Nothing but air, thin air ....",
    "Oh. One more loaf of wonderbread,",
    "only a pun for bread, seductive",
    "visually, but you could starve.",
    "Get rid of it, throw it in the river\u0097",
    "Beyond which, grain fields. Future food for the just",
    "and the unjust, those who love, and do not love."
