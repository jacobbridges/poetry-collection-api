    "A kind of Danish cow",
    "long thought to be extinct",
    "lumbers slowly from a fog-soaked forest.",
    "Past the statue of two men shaking hands on horseback.",
    "Into the trainyard with its newly",
    "brunette-colored coal cars.",
    "It is late, lamps light the trainyard.",
    "One of the trainmen sees the cow and has a thought",
    "like a small grey infant sinking",
    "ever so slowly in the icy harbor.",
    "The cow continues out the other side of the trainyard.",
    "The trainman shudders at the thought.",
    "The trainman\u2019s cat Stamina crunches walnuts in her cat dish.",
    "Now, nearly thirty years later,",
    "ladies and gentlemen it is my great pleasure",
    "to introduce to you that very same cow.",
    "(The cow is led out onto the stage by a young boy dressed as a farmer.)"
