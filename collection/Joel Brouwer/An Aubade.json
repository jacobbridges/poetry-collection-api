    "She said what about San Francisco? Another",
    "second chance. There would be bridges \"shrouded",
    "in fog.\" Streets \"pregnant and glowing\" with traffic.",
    "Dawn, she didn't know, would maybe \"draw near.\"",
    "He said dawn draws near everywhere. She said",
    "a city but a city close to nature. A backyard",
    "scattered with birds he wouldn't be able to identify",
    "and something exotic rotting. Avocadoes.",
    "They'd play a game on the bridge, she'd lose",
    "control of the car, he'd kick her foot away",
    "and mash the gas pedal to the floor until she",
    "screamed and they'd have a name for the game",
    "and later it would be a story for their kids if",
    "they had any kids later. But no city is close to nature.",
    "Her body is a white slash beneath the green sheet.",
    "Or \"a sterilized instrument.\" Last night's wine dregs",
    "are both \"the color of the valley as it ignites\"",
    "and in fact that color. He pulls the sheets from her",
    "again and says he'll cut their coffins from",
    "a wazi'hcaka even if it leaves a gray jay homeless.",
    "The lumber's astringency. Fuck guacamole.",
    "Deep in her knots and sap. Faster and faster. Second",
    "nature. And now a different dawn drawing near."
