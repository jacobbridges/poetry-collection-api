    "Last night she came to me, my mother, dead:",
    "but as she was in the photo, that last Christmas,",
    "wearing a red dress, and her lipstick was red",
    "(I wonder if that means she lives in hell),",
    "and I saw again that she was beautiful,",
    "the same high forehead I have, the same wide brow,",
    "and just my age, forty-nine; and now I was",
    "talking fast, because I knew I had no time,",
    "and I told her I loved her, I told her how her life",
    "had informed mine, and I begged her to come",
    "to me again, to meet my children, my wife.",
    "I said to her\u2014My work, see what I have made,",
    "I have tried to do what you did not live to do.",
    "But she smiled at me and began to fade."
