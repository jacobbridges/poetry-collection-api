    "I am watching the movie",

    "is a joke. He is not Henry Fonda,",

    "to all, as obvious as Henry Fonda\u2019s goodness.",
    "I watch the movie again and again, loving",
    "the black and white of it, soothed",
    "by the sound of my father\u2019s voice,",
    "the careless pronunciation, the easy",
    "shrugging of the shoulders at every crucial question.",
    "I sink lower into the dark arms of the sofa.",
    "Strange how comfortable the familiar is,",
    "how we can even prefer it,",
    "however terrifying."
