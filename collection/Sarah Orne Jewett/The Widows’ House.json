    "What of this house with massive walls",
    "And small-paned windows, gay with blooms?",
    "A quaint and ancient aspect falls",
    "Like pallid sunshine through the rooms.",
    "Not this new country\u2019s rush and haste",
    "Could breed, one thinks, so still a life;",
    "Here is the old Moravian home,",
    "A placid foe of worldly strife.",
    "For this roof covers, night and day,",
    "The widowed women poor and old,",
    "The mated without mates, who say",
    "Their light is out, their story told.",
    "To these the many mansions seem",
    "Dear household fires that cannot die;",
    "They wait through separation dark",
    "An endless union by and by.",
    "Each window has its watcher wan",
    "To fit the autumn afternoon,",
    "The dropping poplar leaves, the dream",
    "Of spring that faded all too soon.",
    "Upon the highest window-ledge",
    "A glowing scarlet flower shines down.",
    "Oh, wistful sisterhood, whose home",
    "Has sanctified this quiet town!",
    "Oh, hapless household, gather in",
    "The tired-hearted and the lone!",
    "What broken homes, what sundered love,",
    "What disappointment you have known!",
    "They count their little wealth of hope",
    "And spend their waiting days in peace,",
    "What comfort their poor loneliness",
    "Must find in every soul\u2019s release!",
    "And when the wailing trombones go",
    "Along the street before the dead",
    "In that Moravian custom quaint,",
    "They smile because a soul has fled."
