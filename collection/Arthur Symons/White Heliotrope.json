    "The feverish room and that white bed,",

    "The novel flung half-open, where",

    "The mirror that has sucked your face",
    "Into its secret deep of deeps,",
    "And there mysteriously keeps",
    "Forgotten memories of grace;",
    "And you half dressed and half awake,",
    "Your slant eyes strangely watching me,",
    "And I, who watch you drowsily,",
    "With eyes that, having slept not, ache;",
    "This (need one dread? nay, dare one hope?)",
    "Will rise, a ghost of memory, if",
    "Ever again my handkerchief",
    "Is scented with White Heliotrope."
