    "Here, where God lives among the trees,",
    "Where birds and monks the whole day sing",
    "His praises in a pleasant ease,",
    "O heart, might we not find a home",
    "Here, after all our wandering?",
    "These gates are closed, even on Rome.",
    "Souls of the twilight wander here ;",
    "Here, in the garden of that death",
    "Which was for love's sake, need we fear",
    "How sharp with bitter joy might be",
    "Love's lingering, last, longed-for breath,",
    "Shut in upon eternity?"
