    "George Borrow in his",
    "Tells us of a Welshman, who",
    "By some excess of mother-wit",
    "Framed a harp and played on it,",
    "Built a ship and sailed to sea,",
    "And steered it home to melody",
    "Of his own making. I, indeed,",
    "Might write for Everyman to read",
    "A thaumalogue of wonderment",
    "More wonderful, but rest content",
    "With celebrating one I knew",
    "Who built his pipes, and played them, too:",
    "No more.",
    "Ah, played! Therein is all:",
    "The hounded thing, the hunter's call;",
    "The shudder, when the quarry's breath",
    "Is drowned in blood and stilled in death;",
    "The marriage dance, the pulsing vein,",
    "The kiss that must be given again;",
    "The hope that Ireland, like a rose,",
    "Sees shining thro' her tale of woes;",
    "The battle lost, the long lament",
    "For blood and spirit vainly spent;",
    "And so on, thro' the varying scale",
    "Of passion that the western Gael",
    "Knows, and by miracle of art",
    "Draws to the chanter from the heart",
    "Like water from a hidden spring,",
    "To leap or murmur, weep or sing.",
    "I see him now, a little man",
    "In proper black, whey-bearded, wan,",
    "With eyes that scan the eastern hills",
    "Thro' thick, gold-rimm\u00e8d spectacles.",
    "His hand is on the chanter. Lo,",
    "The hidden spring begins to flow",
    "In waves of magic. (He is dead",
    "These seven years, but bend your head",
    "And listen.) Rising from the clay",
    "The Master plays",
    ".",
    "It mounts and falls and floats away",
    "Over the sky-line . . . then is gone",
    "Into the silence of the dawn!"
