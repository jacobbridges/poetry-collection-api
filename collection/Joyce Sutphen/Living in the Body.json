    "Body is something you need in order to stay",
    "on this planet and you only get one.",
    "And no matter which one you get, it will not",
    "be satisfactory. It will not be beautiful",
    "enough, it will not be fast enough, it will",
    "not keep on for days at a time, but will",
    "pull you down into a sleepy swamp and",
    "demand apples and coffee and chocolate cake.",
    "Body is a thing you have to carry",
    "from one day into the next. Always the",
    "same eyebrows over the same eyes in the same",
    "skin when you look in the mirror, and the",
    "same creaky knee when you get up from the",
    "floor and the same wrist under the watchband.",
    "The changes you can make are small and",
    "costly\u2014better to leave it as it is.",
    "Body is a thing that you have to leave",
    "eventually. You know that because you have",
    "seen others do it, others who were once like you,",
    "living inside their pile of bones and",
    "flesh, smiling at you, loving you,",
    "leaning in the doorway, talking to you",
    "for hours and then one day they",
    "are gone. No forwarding address."
