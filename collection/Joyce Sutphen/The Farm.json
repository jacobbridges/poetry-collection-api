    "My father\u2019s farm is an apple blossomer.",
    "He keeps his hills in dandelion carpet",
    "and weaves a lane of lilacs between the rose",
    "and the jack-in-the-pulpits.",
    "His sleek cows ripple in the pastures.",
    "The dog and purple iris",
    "keep watch at the garden\u2019s end.",
    "His farm is rolling thunder,",
    "a lightning bolt on the horizon.",
    "His crops suck rain from the sky",
    "and swallow the smoldering sun.",
    "His fields are oceans of heat,",
    "where waves of gold",
    "beat the burning shore.",
    "A red fox",
    "pauses under the birch trees,",
    "a shadow is in the river\u2019s bend.",
    "When the hawk circles the land,",
    "my father\u2019s grainfields whirl beneath it.",
    "Owls gather together to sing in his woods,",
    "and the deer run his golden meadow.",
    "My father\u2019s farm is an icicle,",
    "a hillside of white powder.",
    "He parts the snowy sea,",
    "and smooths away the valleys.",
    "He cultivates his rows of starlight",
    "and drags the crescent moon",
    "through dark unfurrowed fields."
