    "just a yard as elder earth,",
    "a library of sunflowers",
    "battered by the night\u2019s rain.",
    "When sliced wide, halved at dawn,",
    "I can see how you exist,",
    "O satellite town, your bright possibility",
    "born again in drywall",
    "and the diary with the trick lock.",
    "Hardly held, for years I slept",
    "with my window wide open,",
    "wanting screen-cut threads of rain.",
    "Blind suburb, dear untruth,",
    "you who already know what I mean",
    "when I praise every spared copse,",
    "you were my battery, my sad clue,",
    "but after I mowed the lawn",
    "and watched robins chesting",
    "for seeds I couldn\u2019t resist",
    "what hung in the toolshed,",
    "where, with a pair of garden shears",
    "I cut all the hair from my arms. That need,",
    "that scared need to whiten",
    "or clean a surface: plywood or lawn,",
    "and the spywall behind which I stood,",
    "stock-still, and sinned against",
    "the fly\u2019s flyness. Though you live",
    "inside me, though you laid eggs",
    "in the moisture at the corners",
    "of my eyes, I still dream about",
    "your sinking empire twenty feet above",
    "sea level, and the many things",
    "you never see: beautiful bleached",
    "gas can, tomato posts bent into art,",
    "still looks like a butterfly, etc."
