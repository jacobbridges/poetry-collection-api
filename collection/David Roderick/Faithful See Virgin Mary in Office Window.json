    "In flowerbeds we crowd, some praying,",
    "some bowing as the world, minute as it is,",
    "stays in motion: box stores doing business,",
    "fast food joints, and above us a crow,",
    "secular bird, lighting on a lamppost",
    "while we take pictures or cry as if we could",
    "live forever in this gloried surround,",
    "gazing up at the window holding her bleared",
    "hair, her mouth that is a frenzy of trapped",
    "pollen or dust, eyes like smooth shells",
    "that make us forget what fertilized",
    "the flowers at our feet, bulbs fortified",
    "with potash or bone meal, dried blood,",
    "which reminds me of the",
    "I saw in Italy, painted by those who thought",
    "color itself was divine: crushed shell,",
    "coral and ash, pigments mixed with egg",
    "in a man\u2019s mouth, and I worry about",
    "standing too close to the believers, I who",
    "rubberneck and lie, do I stand too close",
    "to the woman at least six months along",
    "with her own child, waving a sonogram",
    "with a faint infant shape inside, an image",
    "scratched by waves: light squandered here,",
    "dilated there, compressed oil and dust",
    "as every body contains its atlas of salt,",
    "kiss-worn, and always some bud dreamed",
    "in springtime, and though I\u2019m a yarner",
    "and one for whom doubt is a clutched root,",
    "I can\u2019t yet walk to my car, standing here",
    "wondering if after His birth the virgin girl",
    "saw the rest of her life would be nothing",
    "but a way to talk about that morning:",
    "gold nearly blinding, herdsmen and kings,",
    "and with its broad warm tongue",
    "a cow licking the afterbirth from the hay."
