    "What the scale tells you is how much the earth",
    "has missed you, body, how it wants you back",
    "again after you leave it to go forth",
    "into the light. Do you remember how",
    "earth hardly noticed you then? Others would rock",
    "you in their arms, warm in the flow",
    "that fed you, coaxed you upright. Then earth began",
    "to claim you with spots and fevers, began to lick",
    "at you with a bruised knee, a bloody shin,",
    "and finally to stoke you, body, drumming",
    "intimate coded messages through music",
    "you danced to unawares, there in your dreaming",
    "and your poems and your obedient blood.",
    "Body, how useful you became, how lucky,",
    "heavy with news and breakage, rich, and sad,",
    "sometimes, imagining that greedy zero",
    "you must have been, that promising empty sack",
    "of possibilities, never-to-come tomorrow.",
    "But look at you now, body, soft old shoe",
    "that love wears when it\u2019s stirring, look down, look",
    "how earth wants what you weigh, needs what you know."
