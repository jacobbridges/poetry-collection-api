    "While I figure out a simple, clean, and effective way to kill myself,",
    "With minimal stress for the person who has to find and dispose of my body",
    "But I'll probably never think of a way",
    "Because I'll probably never kill myself",
    "I'll just lie in my bed suffocating myself with my pillows",
    "While listening to the four songs you said were your favorite",
    "And maybe burn myself a little with the iron",
    "On special occasions",
    "And the next time I'm in a subway station,",
    "I'll stand a little further on the yellow line",
    "Or maybe the next I'm at your apartment",
    "I'll try a little harder"
