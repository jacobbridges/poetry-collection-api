    "Occasionally he wakes, finds",
    "the cool cube of his room",
    "delirious with colors: blaring",
    "daffodils and rigid roses,",
    "petals a soft, translucent red",
    "like the inside of an eyelid.",
    "By the window, a clock's",
    "expressionless face near glossy skins",
    "of magazines, a telephone",
    "the color of frozen milk",
    "or silence, the color of old.",
    "He is melting, his bones",
    "grown paper-light, they travel",
    "over the bed's pale hills, the woman",
    "who's come to wash him.",
    "The ceiling is a landscape",
    "bleeding white as he floats",
    "through the muted winter sky,",
    "a boundless symbol of nothing.",
    "The woman draws the blind."
