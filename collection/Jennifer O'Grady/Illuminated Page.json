    "A gold box of Latin words",
    "rests in a dazzling, fanciful field",
    "someone raised to life, lavishing",
    "flowers with untraceable roots, histories",
    "too distant to discern,",
    "upon skin-pale, palm-sized vellum.",
    "Imagine the one who did this, lost",
    "in dwindling light, a trembling flame",
    "and painstakingly lovely colors:",
    "blood red, violet, heavy yellow",
    "and fierce, unnatural green.",
    "Framed like a window",
    "to the artist's heart, the mother",
    "and child, uncomprehending men",
    "offering what they can: the infant",
    "touches a tiny, gold-leaf casket.",
    "All around him the dark, heraldic blue",
    "of angel winds, night sky, her veil.",
    "And below him, you can see",
    "the word God printed",
    "over infinitely",
    "careful erasures."
