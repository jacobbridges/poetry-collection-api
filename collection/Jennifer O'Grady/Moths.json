    "Adrift in the liberating, late light",
    "of August, delicate, frivolous,",
    "they make their way to my front porch",
    "and flutter near the glassed-in bulb,",
    "translucent as a thought suddenly",
    "wondered aloud, illumining the air",
    "that's thick with honeysuckle and dusk.",
    "You and I are doing our best",
    "at conversation, keeping it light, steering clear",
    "of what we'd like to say.",
    "You leave, and the night becomes",
    "cluttered with moths, some tattered,",
    "their dumbly curious filaments",
    "startling against my cheek. How quickly,",
    "instinctively, I brush them away.",
    "Dazed, they cling to the outer darkness",
    "like pale reminders of ourselves.",
    "Others seem to want so desperately",
    "to get inside. Months later, I'll find",
    "the woolens, snug in their resting places,",
    "full of missing pieces."
