    "Announced by all the trumpets of the sky,",
    "Arrives the snow, and, driving o'er the fields,",
    "Seems nowhere to alight: the whited air",
    "Hides hills and woods, the river, and the heaven,",
    "And veils the farm-house at the garden's end.",
    "The sled and traveller stopped, the courier's feet",
    "Delayed, all friends shut out, the housemates sit",
    "Around the radiant fireplace, enclosed",
    "In a tumultuous privacy of storm.",
    "Come see the north wind's masonry.",
    "Out of an unseen quarry evermore",
    "Furnished with tile, the fierce artificer",
    "Curves his white bastions with projected roof",
    "Round every windward stake, or tree, or door.",
    "Speeding, the myriad-handed, his wild work",
    "So fanciful, so savage, nought cares he",
    "For number or proportion. Mockingly,",
    "On coop or kennel he hangs Parian wreaths;",
    "A swan-like form invests the hidden thorn;",
    "Fills up the farmer's lane from wall to wall,",
    "Maugre the farmer's sighs; and, at the gate,",
    "A tapering turret overtops the work.",
    "And when his hours are numbered, and the world",
    "Is all his own, retiring, as he were not,",
    "Leaves, when the sun appears, astonished Art",
    "To mimic in slow structures, stone by stone,",
    "Built in an age, the mad wind's night-work,",
    "The frolic architecture of the snow."
