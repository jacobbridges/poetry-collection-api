    "Who gave thee, O Beauty,",
    "The keys of this breast,\u2014",
    "Too credulous lover",
    "Of blest and unblest?",
    "Say, when in lapsed ages",
    "Thee knew I of old;",
    "Or what was the service",
    "For which I was sold?",
    "When first my eyes saw thee,",
    "I found me thy thrall,",
    "By magical drawings,",
    "Sweet tyrant of all!",
    "I drank at thy fountain",
    "False waters of thirst;",
    "Thou intimate stranger,",
    "Thou latest and first!",
    "Thy dangerous glances",
    "Make women of men;",
    "New-born, we are melting",
    "Into nature again.",
    "Lavish, lavish promiser,",
    "Nigh persuading gods to err!",
    "Guest of million painted forms,",
    "Which in turn thy glory warms!",
    "The frailest leaf, the mossy bark,",
    "The acorn\u2019s cup, the raindrop\u2019s arc,",
    "The swinging spider\u2019s silver line,",
    "The ruby of the drop of wine,",
    "The shining pebble of the pond,",
    "Thou inscribest with a bond",
    "In thy momentary play,",
    "Would bankrupt nature to repay.",
    "Ah, what avails it",
    "To hide or to shun",
    "Whom the Infinite One",
    "Hath granted his throne?",
    "The heaven high over",
    "Is the deep\u2019s lover;",
    "The sun and sea,",
    "Informed by thee,",
    "Before me run",
    "And draw me on,",
    "Yet fly me still,",
    "As Fate refuses",
    "To me the heart Fate for me chooses.",
    "Is it that my opulent soul",
    "Was mingled from the generous whole;",
    "Sea-valleys and the deep of skies",
    "Furnished several supplies;",
    "And the sands whereof I\u2019m made",
    "Draw me to them, self-betrayed?",
    "I turn the proud portfolio",
    "Which holds the grand designs",
    "Of Salvator, of Guercino,",
    "And Piranesi\u2019s lines.",
    "I hear the lofty paeans",
    "Of the masters of the shell,",
    "Who heard the starry music",
    "And recount the numbers well;",
    "Olympian bards who sung",
    "Divine Ideas below,",
    "Which always find us young",
    "And always keep us so.",
    "Oft in streets or humblest places,",
    "I detect far-wandered graces,",
    "Which, from Eden wide astray,",
    "In lowly homes have lost their way.",
    "Thee gliding through the sea of form,",
    "Like the lightning through the storm,",
    "Somewhat not to be possessed,",
    "Somewhat not to be caressed,",
    "No feet so fleet could ever find,",
    "No perfect form could ever bind.",
    "Thou eternal fugitive,",
    "Hovering over all that live,",
    "Quick and skilful to inspire",
    "Sweet, extravagant desire,",
    "Starry space and lily-bell",
    "Filling with thy roseate smell,",
    "Wilt not give the lips to taste",
    "Of the nectar which thou hast.",
    "All that\u2019s good and great with thee",
    "Works in close conspiracy;",
    "Thou hast bribed the dark and lonely",
    "To report thy features only,",
    "And the cold and purple morning",
    "Itself with thoughts of thee adorning;",
    "The leafy dell, the city mart,",
    "Equal trophies of thine art;",
    "E\u2019en the flowing azure air",
    "Thou hast touched for my despair;",
    "And, if I languish into dreams,",
    "Again I meet the ardent beams.",
    "Queen of things! I dare not die",
    "In Being\u2019s deeps past ear and eye;",
    "Lest there I find the same deceiver.",
    "And be the sport of Fate forever.",
    "Dread Power, but dear! if God thou be,",
    "Unmake me quite, or give thyself to me!"
