    "Daughters of Time, the hypocritic Days,",

    "And marching single in an endless file,",

    "To each they offer gifts after his will,",
    "Bread, kingdoms, stars, or sky that holds them all.",
    "I, in my pleached garden, watched the pomp,",
    "Forgot my morning wishes, hastily",
    "Took a few herbs and apples, and the Day",
    "Turned and departed silent. I, too late,",
    "Under her solemn fillet saw the scorn."
