    "Good-bye, proud world! I'm going home:",
    "Thou art not my friend, and I'm not thine.",
    "Long through thy weary crowds I roam;",
    "A river-ark on the ocean brine,",
    "Long I've been tossed like the driven foam;",
    "But now, proud world! I'm going home.",
    "Good-bye to Flattery's fawning face;",
    "To Grandeur with his wise grimace;",
    "To upstart Wealth's averted eye;",
    "To supple Office, low and high;",
    "To crowded halls, to court and street;",
    "To frozen hearts and hasting feet;",
    "To those who go, and those who come;",
    "Good-bye, proud world! I'm going home.",
    "I am going to my own hearth-stone,",
    "Bosomed in yon green hills alone, \u0097",
    "A secret nook in a pleasant land,",
    "Whose groves the frolic fairies planned;",
    "Where arches green, the livelong day,",
    "Echo the blackbird's roundelay,",
    "And vulgar feet have never trod",
    "A spot that is sacred to thought and God.",
    "O, when I am safe in my sylvan home,",
    "I tread on the pride of Greece and Rome;",
    "And when I am stretched beneath the pines,",
    "Where the evening star so holy shines,",
    "I laugh at the lore and the pride of man,",
    "At the sophist schools, and the learned clan;",
    "For what are they all, in their high conceit,",
    "When man in the bush with God may meet?"
