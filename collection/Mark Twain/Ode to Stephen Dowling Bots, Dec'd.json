    "Young Stephen Dowling Bots.",
    "O no. Then list with tearful eye,",
    "Whilst I his fate do tell.",
    "His soul did from this cold world fly,",
    "By falling down a well.",
    "They got him out and emptied him;",
    "Alas it was too late;",
    "His spirit was gone for to sport aloft",
    "In the realms of the good and great."
