    "The heat shimmer along our street",
    "one midsummer midafternoon,",
    "and wading up through it a horse\u2019s hooves,",
    "and each shoe raising a tongueless bell",
    "that tolled in the neighborhood,",
    "till the driver drew in the reins",
    "and the horse hung its head and stood.",
    "And something in a basket thin",
    "as shavings (blackberries? or a ghost",
    "of the memory of having tasted them?)",
    "passing into my hands as mother paid,",
    "and the man got up again,",
    "slapping the loop from the reins,",
    "and was off on his trundling wagon.\ufeff"
