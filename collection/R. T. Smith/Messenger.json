    "Two nights he came to me, mute,",
    "on fire, no dream. I woke to find",
    "the window embered and fog filling",
    "the willows. The third time",
    "he was milder and early, his gray form",
    "all ash. He said to me at bedside, kneeling,",
    "\u201cYou must say your life to save it.\u201d",
    "Midnight, hoarfrost. I was not yet ten",
    "and didn\u2019t know what to make of so brief",
    "a bedtime story. His features",
    "were simple and familiar\u2014the smile,",
    "both eyes shut in bliss, I guessed,",
    "head and torso echoing an antique",
    "keyhole. From sleep\u2019s icy edge",
    "I asked, \u201cHow?\u201d But he was gone,",
    "the room all hazed. The air smelled",
    "of struck matches, scuppernong,",
    "a copperhead\u2019s musk. What next?",
    "The moon was new in the budding",
    "bird cherry and Venus startling overhead.",
    "Dizzy for water, I followed",
    "my flashlight down the stairs",
    "where the black mantel clock",
    "was bonging. Beside it sat the twin",
    "of my herald, a stone bookend",
    "from Kildare and no more able",
    "to speak or take wing than a weathercock.",
    "His closed eyes told me, \u201cLook",
    "inside,\u201d but I ached to see him blaze",
    "again and say aloud how change",
    "could shake me to a shining. \u201cBut",
    "I must be the key,\u201d I thought,",
    "and stepped over the sparkling threshold.",
    "My nightshirt floated ghostly",
    "across the scalded lawn, under the arbor,",
    "beside the barn, my soles not troubled",
    "by white grass crackling",
    "all the way to the well shed,",
    "the burning that must",
    "have been coming from me."
