    "Because someone thirsty enough",
    "to trust Old Testament wisdom",
    "followed the deepening greens",
    "and found a spring, silver",
    "in the shadow of blue ridges,",
    "I can kneel beneath",
    "this spill of willow",
    "limbs a century later",
    "and drink water",
    "risen from roots",
    "to enter the evening",
    "through a spout, the way",
    "Cherokee stories say the first",
    "people were born,",
    "washing into the world",
    "of such trees whose bark,",
    "like the water I cup",
    "to my parched mouth,",
    "tastes leafy and sweet",
    "and has the power,",
    "the old ones say, to heal."
