    "When fall brought the graders to Atlas Road,",
    "I drove through gray dust thick as a battle",
    "and saw the ditch freshly scattered with gravel.",
    "Leveling, shaving on the bevel, the blade",
    "and fanged scraper had summoned sleepers\u2014",
    "limestone loaves and blue slate, skulls of quartz",
    "not even early freeze had roused. Some rocks",
    "were large as buckets, others just a scone",
    "tumbled up and into light the first time",
    "in ages. Loose, sharp, they were a hazard",
    "to anyone passing. So I gathered",
    "what I could, scooped them into the bed",
    "and trucked my freight away under birdsong",
    "in my own life's autumn. I was eager",
    "to add to the snaggled wall bordering",
    "my single acre, to be safe, to be still",
    "and watch the planet's purposeful turning",
    "behind a cairn of roughly balanced stones.",
    "Uprooted, scarred, weather-gray of bones,",
    "I love their old smell, the familiar unknown.",
    "To be sure this time I know where I belong",
    "I have brought, at last, the vagrant road home."
