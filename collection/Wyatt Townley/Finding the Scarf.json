    "The woods are the book",
    "we read over and over as children.",
    "Now trees lie at angles, felled",
    "by lightning, torn by tornados,",
    "silvered trunks turning back",
    "to earth. Late November light",
    "slants through the oaks",
    "as our small parade, father, mother, child,",
    "shushes along, the wind searching treetops",
    "for the last leaf. Childhood lies",
    "on the forest floor, not evergreen",
    "but oaken, its branches latched",
    "to a graying sky. Here is the scarf",
    "we left years ago like a bookmark,",
    "meaning to return the next day,",
    "having just turned our heads",
    "toward a noise in the bushes,",
    "toward the dinnerbell in the distance,",
    "toward what we knew and did not know",
    "we knew, in the spreading twilight",
    "that returns changed to a changed place."
