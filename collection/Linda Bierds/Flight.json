    "Osseous, aqueous, cardiac, hepatic\u2014",
    "back from bone the echoes stroke, back",
    "from the halved heart, the lungs",
    "three years of weightlessness have cinched to gills.",
    "From a leather chaise, the astronaut's withered legs",
    "dangle, as back they come, sounds",
    "a beaked percussion hammer startles into shape.",
    "The physician cocks his head and taps\u2014exactly",
    "as a splitter halves his slate, the metamorphic rock",
    "chisel-shocked, then shocked again, halved",
    "and halved, until a roof appears, black as space.",
    "I'm gaining ground, he says, the astronaut,",
    "who knows, from space, earth is just a blue-green glow,",
    "a pilot light he circled once, lifted, swiftly flown",
    "above the rafters and atmospheres, half himself",
    "and half again some metamorphic click,",
    "extinct as memory. I'm gaining ground,",
    "he says, and back it comes, his glint",
    "of cloud-crossed world: a pilot light",
    "or swaddled leaf, green in the season's infancy."
