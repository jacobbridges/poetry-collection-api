    "A car is idling on the cliff.",
    "Its top is down. Its headlights throw",
    "A faint, bright ghost-shadow glow",
    "On the pale air. On the shore, so far",
    "Below that the waves' push and drag",
    "Is dwindled to a hush\u2014a kind",
    "Of oceanic idle\u2014the sea",
    "Among the boulders plays a blind-",
    "Fold game of hide and seek,",
    "Or capture the flag. The flag",

    "Of June. Nineteen fifty-three.",
    "A car's idling on the cliff,",
    "But surely it won't be long before",
    "Somebody stops to investigate",
    "And things begin to happen fast:",
    "Men, troops of men will come,",
    "Arrive with blazing lights, a blast",
    "Of sirens, followed by still more",
    "Men. Though not a soul's in sight,",
    "The peace of the end of the late",
    "Afternoon\u2014the sun down, but enough light",
    "Even so to bathe the heavens from",
    "Horizon to shore in a deep",
    "And delicate blue\u2014will not keep.",
    "Confronted with such an overload",
    "Of questions (most beginning,",
    "...",
    "So gifted, bright, and only twenty-three),",
    "Attention will come to fix upon",
    "This odd last thing she did: leaving",
    "The car running, the headlights on.",
    "She stopped\u2014it will transpire\u2014to fill",

    "She'd not yet made up her mind? Or",
    "Had made it up but not yet settled",

    "Where she was headed, what she would do\u2014",
    "And wanted to make sure the car ran",
    "For hours afterward? Might the car not be,",
    "Then, a sort of beacon, a lighthouse-",
    "In-reverse, meant to direct one not",
    "Away from but toward the shore",
    "And its broken boulders, there to spot",

    "(\"She chanted snatches of old lands\")",
    "That will muddle the town for three days,",
    "Until a Professor E. H. Wade",

    "The night will be lovely, as she foresaw,",
    "The first stars easing through the blue,",
    "Engine and ocean breathing together."
