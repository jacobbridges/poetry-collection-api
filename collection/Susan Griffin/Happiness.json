    "I never understood",
    "they were mine.",

    "Years ago, when I was young",
    "I traveled to Italy, took in",
    "the great sights. I was in awe, yet",
    "I did not understand",
    "seeing Masaccio\u2019s frescoes",
    "fading like shadows into the walls,",

    "opera, was it the one of love,",
    "or jealousy, or grief?",
    "My house was untouched.",
    "Now the one next door is painted,",
    "fixed. In place of",

    "With what? A letter",

    "of age, that sad child\u2019s story",
