    "Be like a bear in the forest of yourself.",
    "Even sleeping you are powerful in your breath.",
    "Every hair has life",
    "and standing, as you do, swaying",
    "from one foot to the other",
    "all the forest stands with you.",
    "Each minute sound, one after another,",
    "is distinct in your ear. Here",
    "in the blur of mixed sensations, you can",
    "feel the crisp outline of being, particulate.",
    "Great as you are, huge as you are and",
    "growling like the deepest drum,",
    "the continual vibration that makes music",
    "what it is,",
    "not some light stone skipped on the surface of things,",
    "you travel below",
    "sounding the depths where only the dauntless go.",
    "Be like the bear and",
    "do not forget",
    "how you rounded your",
    "massive shape over the just ripened",
    "berry which burst",
    "in your mouth that moment",
    "how you rolled in",
    "the wet grass, cool and silvery, mingling",
    "with your sensate skin,",
    "how you shut",
    "your eyes and swam far and farther",
    "still, starlight",
    "shaping itself to your body,",
    "starship rocking the grand, slow waves",
    "under the white trees, in the",
    "snowy night."
