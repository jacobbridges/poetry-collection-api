    "1",
    "I keep placing my hands over",
    "my face, the fingertips just",
    "resting on the place where I feel",
    "my eyebrows and the fine end",
    "of a bone. My eyes are covered",
    "with the blood of my hands, my",
    "palms hold",
    "my jaws. I do this at dinner.",
    "My daughter asks",
    "and by a common miracle",
    "when I smile",
    "she knows I am.",
    "2",
    "I ask her what she will do",
    "after we eat. Sleep she",
    "tells me. But I will clean",
    "the deer skull, wash it.",
    "3",
    "You gave me this skull in the woods",
    "told me to bring it clean",
    "and tell the story I had told you",
    "before, about how the deer had",
    "come to me, and I said I would.",
    "4",
    "And I put this skull on an old",
    "newspaper, pulled the lower part",
    "of the jaws free, touched it first",
    "carefully, as if it would fall apart",
    "in my hands, the bone paper-",
    "thin, and then I saw I could",
    "scrub, so brushed the surface with",
    "steel and my fingers and more",
    "and more this surface became",
    "familiar to me.",
    "5",
    "I wanted to see the lines of it",
    "what it would be if it had been",
    "polished by the wind, the water,",
    "and my hands, these agents making",
    "the skull more itself.",
    "Slowly I was not afraid at all",
    "and my fingers went into the deepest",
    "holes of this thing, not afraid",
    "for myself or it, feeling",
    "suddenly as if cleaning this",
    "small fragment of earth away",
    "from the crevices inside was",
    "like loving.",
    "6",
    "But it was when I touched the place",
    "where the eyes were that I knew",
    "this was the shell of the deer that had",
    "lived here, this was this deer",
    "and not this deer, her home and",
    "now empty of her, but not",
    "empty of her, I knew also, not",
    "empty of her, as my hands",
    "trembled.",
    "7",
    "And in that instant remembered you",
    "had been in that body of",
    "that deer dying, what",
    "does it feel like to be a deer",
    "dying, the death consumes",
    "you like birth, you are",
    "nowhere else but in the center.",
    "8",
    "Remembering those gentle deer",
    "that watched me as I wept,",
    "or the deer that leapt as if",
    "out of my mind, when I saw",
    "speaking there in that green place",
    "the authority of the heart",
    "and the deer of the woods where",
    "my feet stood, stared at me until",
    "I whispered to her and cried",
    "at her presence.",
    "9",
    "And when I cleaned the skull",
    "I washed myself and sat",
    "my body half out of the water",
    "and put my hands again over",
    "my face, my fingers edging the",
    "bone over my eyes, and I thought",
    "how good this feels and this",
    "is a gesture you make.",
    "10",
    "Tell this story of the deer\u2019s skull",
    "you asked quietly and so I",
    "came in my own time to put",
    "these words carefully here",
    "slowly listing each motion",
    "on this thin paper",
    "as fragile and as tough",
    "as knowledge."
