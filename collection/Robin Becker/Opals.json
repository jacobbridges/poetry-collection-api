    "I knew the hard winter of sapphires",
    "set within gold claws,",
    "amber and pipestone strung on gut,",
    "fringed pouches stuffed with hash.",
    "I urged her",
    "that summer of Woodstock,",
    "when I lied to get the car",
    "and draped my love beads",
    "around the neck of someone else\u2019s sister.",
    "In a hayloft in Ohio",
    "my friend lifted three bales",
    "to show me a litter of week-old kittens,",
    "each pair of eyes infected with a slimy mucus.",
    "Their pupils swam in opaque opal membranes",
    "and they would have gone blind",
    "if she had not pulled an eyedropper",
    "of antibiotics from her jacket,",
    "doing what the mother cat",
    "could not do, what the owners",
    "would not trouble themselves to do,",
    "doing what a sister or friend",
    "might do if she took the time",
    "to attend the wayward, opalescent",
    "unhappiness in this world."
