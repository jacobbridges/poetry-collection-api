    "One night from the other side",
    "of a motel wall made of nothing but",
    "sawdust and pink stuff, I",
    "listened as a man cried",
    "to someone on the telephone",
    "that all he wanted",
    "to do before he died",
    "was to come home.",
    "\u201cI want to come home!\u201d",
    "That night a man cried",
    "until I was ankle-deep in sleep,",
    "and then up to my neck, wading",
    "like a swimmer",
    "or like a suicide",
    "through the waves",
    "of him crying",
    "and into the deep",
    "as icebergs cracked into halves,",
    "as jellyfish, like thoughts, were",
    "passed secretly between people.",
    "And the seaweed, like",
    "the sinuous soft green hair",
    "of certain beauty queens,",
    "washed up by the sea.",
    "Except that we",
    "were in Utah, and one of us",
    "was weeping",
    "while the other one",
    "was sleeping, with",
    "nothing but a thin, dry",
    "wall between us."
