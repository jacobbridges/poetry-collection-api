    "Once there was a woman who laughed for years uncontrollably after a stroke.",
    "Once there was a child who woke after surgery to find his parents were impostors.",
    "These seagulls above the parking lot today, made of hurricane and ether, they",
    "have flown directly out of the brain wearing little blue-gray masks, like strangers' faces, full",
    "of wing\u00e9d mania, like television in waiting rooms. Entertainment. Pain. The rage",
    "of fruit trees in April, and your car, which I parked in a shadow before you died, decorated now with feathers,",
    "and unrecognizable",
    "with the windows unrolled",
    "and the headlights on",
    "and the engine still running",
    "in the Parking Space of the Sun."
