    "It ends because the beginning won\u2019t jumpstart",
    "again: red smudge of a mouth, lipstick everywhere",
    "the afterthought a comet leaves on its way",
    "out. What makes this moment unfold like a fine",

    "Honky-tonk in the honeyed brown of an eyeball?",
    "Perfume & its circus of heart-shaped introductions?",
    "It ends because the needle always winds up in",
    "the lead-out, like a man pawing around for broken",
    "spectacles after he wakes in the world\u2019s rubble.",
    "Hand over hand he paws, through stilted guitar",
    "picks & abandoned stilettos, raised skirts & rocks,",
    "glasses as chipped & smudged as the topography",
    "of a skipping record. He could be Albright",
    "himself, foraging the still-life swish of low-rise",
    "tutus & skyscrapers cracked in the twisted",
    "aftermath of a smile. Even without glasses,",
    "he remembers her in high style: magnanimously",
    "coming down the blue & violet threads of night,",
    "her green dress clashing with the bathroom tile."
