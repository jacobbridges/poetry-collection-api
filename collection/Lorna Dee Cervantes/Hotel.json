    "I couldn\u2019t see in this light",
    "even if I wished. The black",
    "grillwork over black, cool upon coal,",
    "kisses me back in an icy press.",
    "Not wanting\u2014anything\u2014but to fall",
    "as the empty trash cans mingle",
    "below with the smell of feral cats.",
    "Flailing moon the color of suds",
    "over this factory of artifice,",
    "moored in the poverty of my untouched",
    "element, downed like a dog",
    "struck by a diesel\u2014one headlamp",
    "flaring before my shadow\u2019s dust",
    "buries its past in a crescent of mirth.",
    "Lost now in this anonymity of barely",
    "knowing you, my body would go",
    "unsearched for in the rubble. Who could",
    "remember my odor, my perfect strangeness",
    "at a glance? Life leaves through the gate",
    "of an ache, where you are, a vanishing",
    "landscape. Do I dare it back?",
    "I don\u2019t know where you go",
    "anymore when you escape",
    "into that vast wilderness",
    "of our legal separation. Your",
    "memory rises from the knocking",
    "pipes, a sudden heat, a blast",
    "of blood. Where does it go?",
    "The galloping horses I hear are not",
    "hooves but my heart kicking in its swollen",
    "stall. But you, you take things as",
    "a letting go, like a beacon that opens",
    "a lens cap to our past. You take off",
    "the dark like this snow-strewn alley,",
    "a radiance, but no light of mine.",
    "Jealous as an abandoned child, I",
    "had no word for",
    ". It floated",
    "in heaven like",
    "or",
    ".",
    "It rose like a muscle and punctuated",
    "my dreams, the ones of ruined houses,",
    "of countries like this one where the faces",
    "of whores and the working poor are my own.",
    "You had Irish eyes the color of old",
    "ice. What you lost was first love",
    "and a word for",
    ", like",
    ",",
    ",",
    ". My bones could grind",
    "themselves to salt and I would still be",
    "this aging woman, this battered lifeline.",
    "History never has been kind to a loser.",
    "What do I see when morning",
    "chops ice into jade? What ring",
    "could I trade now for the freedom",
    "to bleed? What would I remember",
    "of a hearth where the flags",
    "of my silks beat at half mast, where",
    "I studied a sure vocabulary of snow?",
    "I had to leave before I could",
    "hear it: the sound of dishwater",
    "in a steamed house, the singing",
    "of water on white porcelain, cooling",
    "like clots seeping through a wound,",
    "our collision of tensions, a viscous",
    "rendered fat, divorced, releasing."
