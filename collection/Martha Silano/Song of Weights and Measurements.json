    "For there is a dram.",
    "For there is a farthing.",
    "A bushel for your thoughts.",
    "A hand for your withered heights.",
    "For I have jouled along attempting",
    "to quire and wisp.",
    "For I have sized up a mountain\u2019s meters,",
    "come down jiffy by shake to the tune",
    "of leagues and stones.",
    "For once I was your peckish darling.",
    "For once there was the measure",
    "of what an ox could plow",
    "in a single morning.",
    "For once the fother, the reed, the palm.",
    "For one megalithic year I fixed my gaze",
    "on the smiling meniscus, against the gray wall",
    "of graduated cylinder.",
    "For once I measured ten out of ten",
    "on the scale of pain.",
    "For I knew that soon I\u2019d kiss good-bye",
    "the bovate, the hide and hundredweight.",
    "For in each pinch of salt, a whisper of doubt,",
    "for in each medieval moment, emotion,",
    "like an unruly cough syrup bottle,",
    "uncapped. For though I dutifully swallowed",
    "my banana doses, ascended, from",
    "to lanthorn, three barleycorns at a time,",
    "I could not tackle the trudging, trenchant cart.",
    "For now I am forty rods from your chain and bolt.",
    "For now I am my six-sacked self."
