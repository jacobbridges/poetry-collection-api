    "My hair, voluminous from sleeping in",
    "six different positions, redolent with your scent,",
    "helps me recall that last night was indeed real,",
    "that it's possible for a bedspread to spawn",
    "a watershed in the membrane that keeps us",
    "shut in our own skins, mute without pleasure,",
    "that I didn't just dream you into being.",
    "You fit like a fig in the thick of my tongue,",
    "give my hands their one true purpose,",
    "find in my shoulder a groove for your head.",
    "In a clinch, you're clenched and I'm pinched,",
    "we're spooned, forked, wrenched, lynched",
    "in a chestnut by a mob of our own making,",
    "only to be resurrected to stage several revivals",
    "that arise from slightest touch to thwart",
    "deep sleep with necessities I never knew",
    "I knew until meeting you a few days",
    "or many distant, voluptuous lifetimes ago."
