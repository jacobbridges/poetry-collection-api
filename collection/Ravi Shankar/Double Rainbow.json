    "Speeding, without destination, after dark",
    "torrents have poured & been returned",
    "at home, the skies above mirror my mood,",
    "windshield wipers knifing through sheets,",
    "back roads slick with pooling, when a shard",
    "of cloudlessness opens. Pulling over, cutting",
    "the ignition, I unstitch myself from the humid",
    "seat, still fuming, to greet a full spectrum",
    "of color arcing past the treetops in lockstep",
    "with its fainter inverse. Archer's bow, hem",
    "of the sun god's coat, bridge between worlds,",
    "reconciliation & pardon. They don't last."
