    "Honest self-scrutiny too easily mutinies,",
    "mutates into false memories",

    "seeming seen as stuff enough",
    "To fund the hedge of personality,",
    "Though personally, I cannot forget",
    "Whom I have met and somehow wronged,",
    "wrung for a jot of fugitive juice,",
    "Trading some ruse for a blot or two,",
    "Labored to braid from transparent diction",
    "Fiction, quick fix, quixotic fixation.",
    "As the pulse of impulses",
    "Drained through my veins, I tried to live",
    "Twenty lives at once. Now one is plenty."
