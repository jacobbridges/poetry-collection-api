    "Thought thrusts up, homely as a hyacinth",
    "wrapped in its bulb like a root-vegetable,",
    "a ninth-month",
    "belly, where the green indelible",
    "pattern's inscribed into the labyrinth.",
    "Thrust into light, it's air's inhabitant",
    "with light and air as food and drink.",
    "A hyacinth, tumescent pink",
    "on the low wooden Mexican chest",
    "confronts the wintry dusk",
    "with informed self-interest.",
    "Leaf-spears extravagantly ask",
    "what idea, still gnarled up in a knot",
    "of ganglions, will break through the husk",
    "shaped at last, recognizable as thought.",
    "\u2022",
    "Trace, on a city map, trajectories",
    "of partially-forgotten words",
    "along the river's arteries,",
    "volatile substance of a sentient world.",
    "Mauve heather crowds the window-grill. The light",
    "lingers a little later, with a slight",
    "vernal inflection. In a moon-glazed vase",
    "bloom yellow freesias, like some rainy day's",
    "brook-bank, in someone else's memory.",
    "Small whirlpools of perception widen, ring",
    "an infant's numinous discoveries",
    "of syllables for animals, toys, trees:",
    "a Lab's thick coat, the dusty birds",
    "in Claremont Park each tardy urban spring,",
    "a stuffed pink leather horse with button eyes.",
    "\u2022",
    "A question-mark in yellow overalls,",
    "I could read. I was three.",
    "I slept with that pink horse. My one doll's",
    "name was V. J. She'd been given to me",
    "to celebrate the Victory",
    "over Japan, that is to say, the Bomb",
    "I'd spend my schooldays taking shelter from.",
    "I couldn't tie my shoes. But Reddy the fox,",
    "Tootle the engine who jumped off the tracks,",
    "spelled me their stories on my mother's lap",
    "despite weak eyes and poor small-motor skills.",
    "My grandparents were dead: not in pogroms,",
    "not in the camps\u2014of strokes and heart attacks,",
    "merely immigrants, not deportees.",
    "\"When you die, does everything just stop?\"",
    "\u2022",
    "I'm four, in itchy woolen leggings,",
    "the day that I can't recognize the man",
    "down at the park entrance, waving,",
    "as my father. He has ten",
    "more years to live, that spring. Dapper and balding",
    "he walks toward me; then I run toward him, calling",
    "him, flustered by my flawed vision.",
    "Underfoot, the maples' green-",
    "winged seeds splay on mica-specked octagons.",
    "His round face, thin nose, moustache silvered gray",
    "at thirty-eight look (I think now) Hungarian.",
    "I like his wood-smell of two packs a day",
    "as he swings me up to his shoulder",
    "and I say, things look blurry far away",
    "\u2014one Saturday, two years after the war."
