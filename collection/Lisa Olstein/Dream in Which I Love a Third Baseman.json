    "At first he seemed a child,",
    "dirt on his lip and the sun",
    "lighting up his hair behind him.",
    "All around us, the hesitation",
    "of year-rounders who know",
    "the warmer air will bring crowds.",
    "No one goes to their therapist",
    "to talk about how happy they are,",
    "but soon I\u2019d be back in the dugout",
    "telling my batting coach how",
    "the view outside my igloo seemed",
    "to be changing, as if the night",
    "sky were all the light there is.",
    "Now, like two babies reaching",
    "through the watery air to touch soft",
    "fingers to soft forehead, like blind fish",
    "sensing a familiar fluttering in the waves,",
    "slowly, by instinct, we became aware.",
    "Off-field, outside the park, beyond",
    "the gates, something was burning.",
    "The smell was everywhere."
