    "What seemed a mystery was",
    "in fact a choice. Insert bird for sorrow.",

    "a dividing line. Insert bird for wind.",
    "Insert wind for departure when everyone is",
    "standing still. Insert three mountains",
    "burning and in three valleys a signal seer",
    "seeing a distant light and a signal bearer",
    "sprinting to a far-off bell. What seemed",
    "a promise was in fact a sigh.",

    "a forgive me, it has flown away, is in fact.",
    "In the meantime we paint the floors",
    "red. We stroke the sound of certain names",
    "into a fine floss that drifts across our teeth.",
    "We stay in the room we share and listen",
    "all night to what drifts through the window\u2014",
    "dog growl, owl call, a fleet of mosquitoes",
    "setting sail, and down the road,",
    "the swish of tomorrow\u2019s donkey-threshed grain."
