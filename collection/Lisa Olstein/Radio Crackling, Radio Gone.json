    "Thousands of planes were flying and then",
    "they stopped. We spend days moving our eyes",
    "across makeshift desks, we sit on a makeshift floor;",
    "we prepare for almost nothing that might happen.",
    "Early on, distant relations kept calling.",
    "Now, nothing: sound of water",
    "tippling a seawall. Nothing: sparks",
    "lighting the brush, sparks polishing the hail,",
    "the flotsam of cars left standing perfectly still.",
    "Thud of night bird against night air,",
    "there you are on the porch, swath",
    "of feathers visible through the glass,",
    "there you are on the stairs where the cat fell",
    "like a stone because her heart stopped.",
    "What have you found in the wind above town square?",
    "Is it true that even the statues have gone?",
    "Is there really a hush over everything as there used to be",
    "in morning when one by one we took off our veils?"
