    "It has been so wet stones glaze in moss;",
    "everything blooms coldly.",
    "I expect you. I thought one night it was you",
    "at the base of the drive, you at the foot of the stairs,",
    "you in a shiver of light, but each time",
    "leaves in wind revealed themselves,",
    "the retreating shadow of a fox, daybreak.",
    "We expect you, cat and I, bluebirds and I, the stove.",
    "In May we dreamed of wreaths burning on bonfires",
    "over which young men and women leapt.",
    "June efforts quietly.",
    "I\u2019ve planted vegetables along each garden wall",
    "so even if spring continues to disappoint",
    "we can say at least the lettuce loved the rain.",
    "I have new gloves and a new hoe.",
    "I practice eulogies. He was a hawk",
    "with white feathered legs. She had the quiet ribs",
    "of a salamander crossing the old pony post road.",
    "Yours is the name the leaves chatter",
    "at the edge of the unrabbited woods."
