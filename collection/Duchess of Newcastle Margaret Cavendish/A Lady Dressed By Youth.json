    "Her hair was curls of Pleasure and Delight,",
    "Which on her brow did cast a glistening light.",
    "As lace her bashful eyelids downward hung:",
    "A modest countenance o'er her face was flung:",
    "Blushes, as coral beads, she strung to wear",
    "About her neck, and pendants for each ear:",
    "Her gown was by Proportion cut and made,",
    "With veins embroidered, with complexion laid,",
    "Rich jewels of pure honor she did wear,",
    "By noble actions brightened everywhere:",
    "Thus dressed, to Fame's great court straightways she went,",
    "To dance a brawl with Youth, Love, Mirth, Content."
