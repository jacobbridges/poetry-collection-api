    "This one appeared to me",
    "in a dream, was forgotten,",
    "only to reveal itself",
    "on the shower wall",
    "this morning.",
    "It must have been the water.",
    "That one was on the full moon",
    "last night, clear as a bell.",
    "Someone projected it there.",
    "This one was on the ground,",
    "on crunchy pine needles.",
    "The moon projected it there.",
    "I forgot about that one . . .",
    "How was I to know",
    "it would be significant?",
    "Every time I see this one,",
    "I'm angry. It doesn't diminish,",
    "either, from that first time.",
    "Oh, that one!",
    "To tell you the truth,",
    "I never actually",
    "saw it, but I could",
    "feel it as it was",
    "described to me",
    "by a blind person",
    "over the phone.",
    "This one I spotted",
    "on the back",
    "of someone's shirt",
    "in a crowd",
    "before she disappeared.",
    "That one evolved,",
    "and is still evolving,",
    "on that big, flat rock",
    "over there; something",
    "scraped it, scratched it,",
    "the heat cracked it,",
    "the frost coated it,",
    "tiny plants took root,",
    "sheltering insects,",
    "and it rained,",
    "and it rained,",
    "and by the time",
    "I showed up,",
    "a butterfly had just flown off.",
    "Not this one again.",
    "It makes me so sad . . .",
    "I was glad to receive",
    "that one as a gift.",
    "So glad, in fact,",
    "that I went and had",
    "some copies made.",
    "Believe it or not,",
    "this one has a sound.",
    "Just listen.",
    "Oh, boy\u2014that one!",
    "I'll never go there again.",
    "This one often arrives",
    "in the smoke of incense.",
    "I tried to turn",
    "that one over\u2014",
    "it burned my hand.",
    "This one I tried",
    "to discard\u2014",
    "unsuccessfully, obviously.",
    "That one speaks to me",
    "of space, and negative space,",
    "of open and filled spaces,",
    "and the among",
    "that comes between.",
    "Whereas this one",
    "is the opposite\u2014",
    "you get the picture.",
    "Oh, my goodness\u2014",
    "I've never seen",
    "that one before!",
    "This one, from what",
    "I gather,",
    "is an accident.",
    "That one, however,",
    "is intended.",
    "This one took some",
    "getting to\u2014",
    "waiting for the thaw,",
    "for instance\u2014",
    "but it was",
    "well worth it.",
    "That one, well,",
    "you can have it.",
    "Whenever this one",
    "comes my way,",
    "it's d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu,",
    "but I'm ready for it.",
    "That one is owned",
    "by the dentist.",
    "This one has been",
    "proven to be a fake,",
    "but I still like it.",
    "Alas, I lost",
    "that one once,",
    "in childhood,",
    "and it took me",
    "until now to find it.",
    "If you can only have",
    "one, choose this one."
