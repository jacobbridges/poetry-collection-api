    "The line didn\u2019t move, though there were not",
    "many people in it. In a half-hearted light",
    "the lone agent dealt patiently, noiselessly, endlessly",
    "with a large dazed family ranging",
    "from twin toddlers in strollers to an old lady",
    "in a bent wheelchair. Their baggage",
    "was all in cardboard boxes. The plane was delayed,",
    "the rumor went through the line. We shrugged,",
    "in our hopeless overcoats. Aviation",
    "had never seemed a very natural idea.",
    "Bored children floated with faces drained of blood.",
    "The girls in the tax-free shops stood frozen",
    "amid promises of a beautiful life abroad.",
    "Louis Armstrong sang in some upper corner,",
    "a trickle of ignored joy.",
    "Outside, in an unintelligible darkness",
    "that stretched to include the rubies of strip malls,",
    "winged behemoths prowled looking for the gates",
    "where they could bury their koala-bear noses",
    "and suck our dimming dynamos dry.",
    "Boys in floppy sweatshirts and backward hats",
    "slapped their feet ostentatiously",
    "while security attendants giggled",
    "and the voice of a misplaced angel melodiously",
    "parroted FAA regulations. Women in saris",
    "and kimonos dragged, as their penance, behind them",
    "toddlers clutching Occidental teddy bears,",
    "and chair legs screeched in the food court",
    "while ill-paid wraiths mopped circles of night",
    "into the motionless floor."
