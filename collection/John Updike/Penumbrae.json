    "The shadows have their seasons, too.",
    "The feathery web the budding maples",
    "cast down upon the sullen lawn",
    "bears but a faint relation to",
    "high summer's umbrageous weight",
    "and tunnellike continuum\u0097",
    "black leached from green, deep pools",
    "wherein a globe of gnats revolves",
    "as airy as an astrolabe.",
    "The thinning shade of autumn is",
    "an inherited Oriental,",
    "red worn to pink, nap worn to thread.",
    "Shadows on snow look blue. The skier,",
    "exultant at the summit, sees his poles",
    "elongate toward the valley: thus",
    "each blade of grass projects another",
    "opposite the sun, and in marshes",
    "the mesh is infinite,",
    "as the winged eclipse an eagle in flight",
    "drags across the desert floor",
    "is infinitesimal.",
    "And shadows on water!\u0097",
    "the beech bough bent to the speckled lake",
    "where silt motes flicker gold,",
    "or the steel dock underslung",
    "with a submarine that trembles,",
    "its ladder stiffened by air.",
    "And loveliest, because least looked-for,",
    "gray on gray, the stripes",
    "the pearl-white winter sun",
    "hung low beneath the leafless wood",
    "draws out from trunk to trunk across the road",
    "like a stairway that does not rise."
