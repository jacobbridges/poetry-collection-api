    "Rocked in my mother\u2019s pregnant amble,",
    "and born into forty-five years in the dark,",
    "the egg this child was also swayed in the arts",
    "of lovers I took before you, fed with me",
    "in the public markets of Baltimore and Denpasar",
    "on oysters and rambutan, woke with me each year",
    "to new waves of wander, fish and flower,",
    "liqueur of each region, and bread of each village,",
    "each cup of moonlight in the long sward",
    "between my window and the Wannsee.",
    "The egg he was heard and voices",
    "of everyone I desired and held itself",
    "in some deep hormonal bloom,",
    "taking whatever was remarkable",
    "in my life into its possibility.",
    "We learned not to hurry in Balinese rain,",
    "to listen for the rumble of wild boar",
    "in the Malvan woods. We climbed",
    "into planes bound for cities we\u2019d never",
    "visit again and skin we\u2019d summon",
    "with sobbing. And so, my husband,",
    "as you dream of owning this child,",
    "remember that he has ridden in my fire,",
    "bathed in my blood, and sipped",
    "at the breath I drew the first",
    "time I saw what Rodin had clawed",
    "from stone before he turned from Claudel",
    "and went home for dinner and a clean shirt.",
    "Remember that this child is collage",
    "of everything before you, frangipani",
    "and escargot, five-for-a-dollar boxes",
    "of macaroni, and French cherries",
    "from an old woman in Auvergne",
    "who insisted on the gift",
    "because it was so marvelous",
    "to see a woman traveling alone."
