    "He arrives in the courtyard with two cartons",
    "of juice, each of which he\u2019ll tip and drain",
    "at one go in the heat, and a sack of food",
    "for the roses. He looms over his tools,",
    "blond and dusty as a stalk of ripe wheat,",
    "surely someone\u2019s prized lover. Centuries",
    "bask among his hybrid teas, and he shakes",
    "his capable handfuls of food into their beds",
    "until nothing but roses nose the blues between lake",
    "and garden, lake and sky, the lapse of lawn",
    "where a party could be if those who lived here once",
    "returned to pour the wine. She\u2019d be the sort",
    "to tuck a bud behind her ear, and he to catch",
    "one in his teeth. But alas, we\u2019re guests",
    "of the present, expectant and sultry; all",
    "graciousness is fled, and rain fills the spent",
    "blooms, tumbles their tops, weighted with ruffles",
    "and shocks of pink. The gardener too disappears",
    "with his breeches the color of mustard and cinched",
    "with a string, gone back into the pages of Hardy",
    "or Lawrence. Perhaps, he\u2019ll appear again Tuesday next,",
    "but he won\u2019t look any of us living in the eye."
