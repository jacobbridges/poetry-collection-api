    "A guy comes walking out of the garden",
    "Playing Dark Eyes on the accordian.",
    "We\u2019re sitting on the porch,",
    "Drinking and spitting, lying.",
    "We shut our eyes, snap our fingers.",
    "Dewhurst goes out to his truck",
    "Like he doesn\u2019t believe what he\u2019s seeing",
    "And brings back three-half-pints.",
    "A little whirlwind occurs in the road,",
    "Carrying dust away like a pail of water.",
    "We\u2019re drinking serious now, and O.Z.",
    "Wants to break in the store for some head cheese,",
    "But the others won\u2019t let him.",
    "Everybody laughs, dances.",
    "The crossroads are all quiet",
    "Except for the little man on the accordian.",
    "Things are dying down, the moon spills its water.",
    "Dewhurst says he smells rain.",
    "O.Z. says if it rains he\u2019ll still make a crop.",
    "We wait there all night, looking for rain.",
    "We haven\u2019t been to sleep, so the blue lizards",
    "On the side of the white porch",
    "Lose their tails when we try to dream.",
    "The man playing the music looks at us,",
    "Noticing what we\u2019re up to. He backs off,",
    "Holding up his hands in front, smiling,",
    "Shaking his head, but before he gets half way",
    "Down the road that O.Z. shoots him in the belly.",
    "All summer his accordian rotted in the ditch,",
    "Like an armadillo turning into a house payment."
