    "When you take the lost road",
    "You come to the snow",
    "And when you find the snow",
    "You get down on your hands and knees",
    "Like a sick dog",
    "That\u2019s been eating the grasses of graveyards",
    "For twenty centuries.",
    "When you take the lost road",
    "You find woman",
    "Who has no fear of light",
    "Who can kill two cocks at once",
    "Light which has no fear of cocks",
    "And cocks who can\u2019t call in the snow.",
    "You find lovers who\u2019ve been listening",
    "For the same roosters to sing",
    "For twenty centuries",
    "Roosters that have swallowed stones",
    "Out of each other\u2019s tracks",
    "But have never met",
    "Anywhere on the road.",
    "When you take the lost road",
    "You find the bright feathers of morning",
    "Laid out in proportion to snow and light",
    "And when the snow gets lost on the road",
    "Then the hot wind might blow from the south",
    "And there is sadness in bed for twenty centuries",
    "And everyone is chewing the grass on the graves again.",
    "When you get lost",
    "You come to the moon in the field",
    "The light all lovers soil",
    "The sheet no one leaves clean",
    "The light cocks are afraid to cross",
    "The same moon woman danced under",
    "For twenty centuries",
    "With blood on her face.",
    "When you get lost on the road",
    "You run into the dead",
    "Who have broken down stones",
    "In their throats for twenty centuries",
    "I saw two little crazy boys crying",
    "Because it was morning",
    "And when morning comes it comes",
    "In the morning and never at night.",
    "I saw two security police taking out a man\u2019s balls",
    "And I saw two little crazy boys",
    "Crying by the road who wouldn\u2019t go away",
    "But two has never been a number",
    "Because it\u2019s only legal to pass one at a time",
    "It\u2019s only a drum you can carry but you can\u2019t beat",
    "It\u2019s the evidence they need to make you disappear."
