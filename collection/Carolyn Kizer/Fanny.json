    "At Samoa, hardly unpacked, I commenced planting,",
    "When I\u2019d opened the chicken crates, built the Cochins a coop.",
    "The Reverend Mr. Claxton called, found me covered with mud,",
    "My clothes torn, my hair in a wad, my bare feet bleeding.",
    "I had started the buffalo grass in the new-made clearing.",
    "The next day the priest paid a visit. Civil but restless,",
    "I was dying to plant the alfalfa seed\u2014gave him a packet.",
    "That evening I paced up and down, dropping melon seeds,",
    "Tomatoes and bush lima beans here and there",
    "Where I thought they would grow. We were short of food now,",
    "So I cooked up a mess of fat little parrots, disturbed",
    "At the way they suggested cages and swings and stands ...",
    "An excellent meal. I have been told the dodo survived here,",
    "And yearn for a pet on a string. And I built the pig-house.",
    "I had brought sweet coconut seed from Savage Island.",
    "I planted kidney potatoes in small earthen hills.",
    "Sowed seeds of eggplant in numerous boxes of soil,",
    "Tomato and artichoke too; half-a-dozen fine pineapple",
    "Sent over by Mr. Carruthers, the island solicitor.",
    "As fast as we eat them, we plant the tops.",
    "The kitchen a shack near the house. I made bread in the rain.",
    "October, 1890. I have been here nearly a month;",
    "Put in corn, peas, onions, radishes, lettuce. Lima beans",
    "Are already coming up. The ripening cantaloupe were stolen.",
    "Carruthers gave me mint root and grenadilla",
    "Like a bouquet; he delivered a load of trees,",
    "Two mangoes among them. I set them out in a heavy rain,",
    "Then rounded off the afternoon sowing Indian corn.",
    "Louis has called me a peasant. How I brooded!",
    "Confided it to you, diary, then crossed it out.",
    "Peasant because I delve in the earth, the earth I own.",
    "Confiding my seed and root\u2014I too a creator?",
    "My heart melts over a bed of young peas. A blossom",
    "On the rose tree is like a poem by my son.",
    "My hurt healed by its cause, I go on planting.",
    "No one else works much. The natives take it easy;",
    "The colonials keep their shops, and a shortage of customers.",
    "The mail comes four times a month, and the gossip all day.",
    "The bars are crowded with amateur politicians,",
    "Office-seekers I named the earwig consul and king:",
    "Big talkers, with small-time conspirators drinking them in.",
    "Mr. Carruthers and I picked a site for the kitchen garden.",
    "I was planting a new lot of corn and pumpkin",
    "When a young chief arrived, laden with pineapple plants.",
    "I set them out as I talked to him on the way home.",
    "Rats and a wild hen ate the corn. Lettuce got too much sun.",
    "So I dug a new patch up the road; in the fragrant evening",
    "I confided to Louis, a puff of the sweetest scent",
    "Blows back as I cast away a handful of so-called weeds!",
    "It still hurts, his remark that I have the soul of a peasant.",

    "Of course, RLS is not idle; he is writing",
    "How the great powers combine to carve up these islands.",
    "I discovered the ylang-ylang tree: a base for perfume,",
    "Though it suggested to me the odor of boots.",
    "Another tree is scented like pepper and spice,",
    "And one terrible tree, I am forced to say,",
    "Smells like ordure ... It nearly made me ill.",
    "Breadfruit is plentiful. I found a banana grove,",
    "Began clearing it instantly, and worked till I was dizzy.",
    "The garden looks like a graveyard: beds shaped like tombs.",
    "I plant cabbage which I loathe, so the British won\u2019t tease me",
    "For not growing it. But behold! in the hedge",
    "Among citron and lime, many lemon trees, in full bearing.",
    "Still, I will fall to brooding before the mirror,",

    "But the neighbors\u2019 horses break in and trample the corn.",
    "Sometimes, when planting, a strange subterranean rumble",
    "\u2014Volcanic?\u2014vexes the earth beneath this peasant haunch.",
    "I rise up from my furrow, knuckle smooth my brow",

    "Louis describes to me endless vivid deeps:",
    "Dreams of nettle-stings, stabs from the citron\u2019s thorns,",
    "The ants\u2019 fiery bites, the resistance of mud and slime,",
    "The evasions of wormy roots, the dead weight of heat",
    "In the sudden puffs of air ... Louis writes till nine,",
    "Then if he\u2019s well enough, he helps with the weeding.",
    "He writes Colvin, keeper of prints at the British Museum,",
    "\u201cI know pleasure still ... with a thousand faces,",
    "None perfect, a thousand tongues, all broken,",
    "A thousand hands, all with scratching nails ...",
    "High among joys, I place this delight of weeding,",
    "Out here alone by the garrulous water, under the silence",
    "Of the high wind, broken by sounds of birds.\u201d",
    "The shock of bird-calls, laughing and whistling!",
