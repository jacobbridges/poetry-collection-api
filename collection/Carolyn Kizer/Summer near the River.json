    "I have carried my pillow to the windowsill",
    "And try to sleep, with my damp arms crossed upon it,",
    "But no breeze stirs the tepid morning.",
    "Only I stir ... Come, tease me a little!",
    "With such cold passion, so little teasing play,",
    "How long can we endure our life together?",
    "No use. I put on your long dressing-gown;",
    "The untied sash trails over the dusty floor.",
    "I kneel by the window, prop up your shaving mirror",
    "And pluck my eyebrows.",
    "I don\u2019t care if the robe slides open",
    "Revealing a crescent of belly, a tan thigh.",
    "I can accuse that nonexistent breeze ...",
    "I am as monogamous as the North Star,",
    "But I don\u2019t want you to know it. You\u2019d only take advantage.",
    "While you are as fickle as spring sunlight.",
    "All right, sleep! The cat means more to you than I.",
    "I can rouse you, but then you swagger out.",
    "I glimpse you from the window, striding toward the river.",
    "When you return, reeking of fish and beer,",
    "There is salt dew in your hair. Where have you been?",
    "Your clothes weren\u2019t that wrinkled hours ago, when you left.",
    "You couldn\u2019t have loved someone else, after loving me!",
    "I sulk and sigh, dawdling by the window.",
    "Later, when you hold me in your arms",
    "It seems, for a moment, the river ceases flowing."
