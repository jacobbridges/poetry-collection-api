    "As I wandered on the beach",
    "I saw the heron standing",
    "Sunk in the tattered wings",
    "He wore as a hunchback\u2019s coat.",
    "Shadow without a shadow,",
    "Hung on invisible wires",
    "From the top of a canvas day,",
    "What scissors cut him out?",
    "Superimposed on a poster",
    "Of summer by the strand",
    "Of a long-decayed resort,",
    "Poised in the dusty light",
    "Some fifteen summers ago;",
    "I wondered, an empty child,",
    "\u201cHeron, whose ghost are you?\u201d",
    "I stood on the beach alone,",
    "In the sudden chill of the burned.",
    "My thought raced up the path.",
    "Pursuing it, I ran",
    "To my mother in the house",
    "And led her to the scene.",
    "The spectral bird was gone.",
    "But her quick eye saw him drifting",
    "Over the highest pines",
    "On vast, unmoving wings.",
    "Could they be those ashen things,",
    "So grounded, unwieldy, ragged,",
    "A pair of broken arms",
    "That were not made for flight?",
    "In the middle of my loss",
    "I realized she knew:",
    "My mother knew what he was.",
    "O great blue heron, now",
    "That the summer house has burned",
    "So many rockets ago,",
    "So many smokes and fires",
    "And beach-lights and water-glow",
    "Reflecting pinwheel and flare:",
    "The old logs hauled away,",
    "The pines and driftwood cleared",
    "From that bare strip of shore",
    "Where dozens of children play;",
    "Now there is only you",
    "Heavy upon my eye.",
    "Why have you followed me here,",
    "Heavy and far away?",
    "You have stood there patiently",
    "For fifteen summers and snows,",
    "Denser than my repose,",
    "Bleaker than any dream,",
    "Waiting upon the day",
    "When, like grey smoke, a vapor",
    "Floating into the sky,",
    "A handful of paper ashes,",
    "My mother would drift away."
