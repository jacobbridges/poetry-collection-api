    "And all my sins consume!",
    "Come, Holy Ghost, for thee I call,",
    "Spirit of burning, come!",
    "9",
    "Refining fire, go through my heart,",
    "Illuminate my soul;",

    "My steadfast soul, from falling free,",
    "Shall then no longer move;",
    "But Christ be all the world to me,",
    "And all my heart be love."
