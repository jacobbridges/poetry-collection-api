    "Out of heaven, to bless the high places,",
    "it falls on the penthouses, drizzling",
    "at first, then a pelting allegro,",
    "and Dick and Jane skip to the terrace",
    "and go boogieing through the azaleas,",
    "while mommy and daddy come running",
    "with pots and pans, glasses, and basins",
    "and try to hold all of it up there,",
    "but no use, it\u2019s too much, it keeps coming,",
    "and pours off the edges, down limestone",
    "to the pitchers and pails on the ground, where",
    "delirious residents catch it,",
    "and bucket brigades get it moving",
    "inside, until bathtubs are brimful,",
    "but still it keeps coming, that shower",
    "of silver in alleys and gutters,",
    "all pouring downhill to the sleazy",
    "red brick, and the barefoot people",
    "who romp in it, laughing, but never",
    "take thought for tomorrow, all spinning",
    "in a pleasure they catch for a moment;",
    "so when Providence turns off the spigot",
    "and the sky goes as dry as a prairie,",
    "then daddy looks down from the penthouse,",
    "down to the streets, to the gutters,",
    "and his heart goes out to his neighbors,",
    "to the little folk thirsty for laughter,",
    "and he prays in his boundless compassion:",
    "on behalf of the world and its people",
    "he demands of his God,"
