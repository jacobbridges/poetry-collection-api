    "1. WALDORF-ASTORIA EUPHORIA,",
    "THE JOY OF BIG CITIES",
    "movements\u2014to dancing about, clapping the",
    "hands, stamping, etc.",
    "You feel so good, you stop walking:",
    "they swirl around you, racing the 6:15.",
    "You bless them all with a smile",
    "you cannot explain: they are suddenly",
    "precious. You look around, with your alien eyes,",
    "at forty floors of windows where",
    "they are laughing, talking, and kissing: you realize",
    "they are priceless. You feel them",
    "under the pavement, riding the uptown express,",
    "straphanging bodies waving",
    "like kelp, and you know",
    "they are irreplaceable; you think of them",
    "all over town, bursting",
    "with unused happiness, and you clap,",
    "and clap again, and clapping, you sing",
    "a song you thought you\u2019d forgotten, and your waist",
    "moves gently, like jonquils, and your hand",
    "catches her fingertips, and she smiles, her arms",
    "moving like willows,",
    "and the fruitseller dances with apples,",
    "crying a musical language, and a girl",
    "with a bongo comes on with rhythm,",
    "her hips moving like wheatfields, and",
    "the hardhats come up from the manholes,",
    "their bodies moving like jackhammers,",
    "and Chinese voices like windchimes",
    "sing to the women from San Juan",
    "who gather around like palm trees, and the cops",
    "have cordoned the street and are dancing",
    "with women from Minnesota,",
    "their thighs as seductive as seaweed;",
    "and you know that sooner or later",
    "this had to happen: that somehow",
    "it would all break out, all that pent-up",
    "joy, and people would sing and hold hands,",
    "their bodies swerving like taxis,",
    "and the music inside their heads",
    "would fill the streets with dancing,",
    "clapping hands, and stamping;",
    "and you sing another chorus",
    "of we,",
    "hey, we,",
    "yes, we,",
    "I said we",
    "are all",
    "we\u2019ve got.",
    "2. HUNKYDORIA EUPHORIA,",
    "THE JOY OF HAVING IT MADE",
    "becomes more rapid, the eyes are bright, and",
    "the colour of the face rises.",
    "You\u2019re sweating it out: the last time",
    "it was never received;",
    "it was lost in the files; sent",
    "to the wrong department.",
    "If you get there by noon, surely",
    "it will be all right; but the seconds",
    "are deadly. At ten to twelve",
    "You reach the office, and of course",
    "there\u2019s a line.",
    "You inch along; at noon you touch",
    "mahogany, and just as you feared, there is",
    "some difficulty, a shuffling",
    "of papers: you feel",
    "the invisible stars",
    "swing through their long",
    "cold journey. Finally\u2014",
    "you can hardly believe it\u2014",
    "it\u2019s there! the very thing! the thing itself!",
    "and the holy rubber stamp",
    "falls like a benediction,",
    "and you hear, above the ceiling,",
    "the seraphim rejoicing,",
    "and you smooth your hair",
    "and borrow a debonair manner",
    "and step through the frosted door",
    "so deliberately,",
    "no one would ever guess",
    "that right there under your shirt",
    "the sun is dancing on water."
