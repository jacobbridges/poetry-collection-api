    "You let your shirt hang down",
    "putting on airs of cuffs",
    "at the edge of ending night",
    "like the end of a java with double ritournelles",
    "or the way the canaries in the cage of still-closed mornings",
    "were singing that it mattered little",
    "to them that their windows were open",
    "the stones the paving stones the door-frames the armatures",
    "the window-frames the sheets of the bed clothes in their colors",
    "were beating the dawn along with us",
    "better drums than your belly",
    "better drumsticks than my fingers",
    "and the trees and the roofs the river and its bridges",
    "the clear distances of the city the factories without smoke",
    "bathed as at their birth stammered",
    "a trial hello",
    "that only ended however",
    "in this word round as a doubloon",
    "placed on the edge of that day",
    "by a considerate friend",
    "the sun on your arms naked against my cheeks",
    "hello I said to you",
    "the day of quatorz\u2019juillet"
