    "As long as you believe in miracles",
    "You watch the sun fall into the sea",
    "Every evening",
    "Then you turn your back and sink",
    "Among the ferns sparkling from a moon or from the other",
    "Night up to your knees under the vault of cries.",
    "The pubescent monkeys, the adolescent pumas",
    "Contemplate the slender crescent",
    "Of the earth",
    "In the eyes of a dead viper",
    "That knots on the asphalt",
    "The alpha of a future alphabet.",
    "It\u2019s the end of night the mosquitoes",
    "Place themselves on your forehead and die with you",
    "In the ruins of your dreams erected",
    "By the distant suggestions of cities",
    "Where you wish to find an empty",
    "Bed to die in.",
    "The cathedrals the cinemas the soliloquies",
    "The beggar\u2019s ear glued to the violin",
    "Music",
    "To be lovesick when the songs",
    "All temple prostitutes all rotgut for two cents",
    "Are going to end up in the pink slit of a jukebox.",
    "Hope is under the hand that weak flesh",
    "Groped massaged turgescent with eyes shut",
    "Comes and goes",
    "Let\u2019s keep knotted kisses to ourselves for a long time",
    "Until another day erases",
    "The trace of each passing."
