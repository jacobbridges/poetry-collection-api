    "Who e\u2019er she be",
    "That not impossible she",
    "That shall command my heart and me;",
    "Wher e\u2019er she lie,",
    "Lock\u2019d up from mortal eye",
    "In shady leaves of destiny;",
    "Till that ripe birth",
    "Of studied fate stand forth",
    "And teach her fair steps to our earth;",
    "Till that divine",
    "Idea take a shrine",
    "Of crystal flesh, through which to shine;",
    "Meet you her, my wishes,",
    "Bespeak her to my blisses,",
    "And be ye call\u2019d my absent kisses.",
    "I wish her beauty",
    "That owes not all his duty",
    "To gaudy tire, or glist\u2019ring shoe-ty.",
    "Something more than",
    "Taffeta or tissue can,",
    "Or rampant feather, or rich fan.",
    "More than the spoil",
    "Of shop, or silkworm\u2019s toil,",
    "Or a bought blush, or a set smile.",
    "A face that\u2019s best",
    "By its own beauty drest,",
    "And can alone command the rest.",
    "A face made up",
    "Out of no other shop",
    "Than what nature\u2019s white hand sets ope.",
    "A cheek where youth,",
    "And blood, with pen of truth",
    "Write, what the reader sweetly ru\u2019th.",
    "A cheek where grows",
    "More than a morning rose,",
    "Which to no box his being owes.",
    "Lips, where all day",
    "A lover\u2019s kiss may play,",
    "Yet carry nothing thence away.",
    "Looks that oppress",
    "Their richest tires, but dress",
    "And clothe their simplest nakedness.",
    "Eyes, that displaces",
    "The neighbour diamond, and outfaces",
    "That sunshine, by their own sweet graces.",
    "Tresses, that wear",
    "Jewels but to declare",
    "How much themselves more precious are.",
    "Whose native ray",
    "Can tame the wanton day",
    "Of gems, that in their bright shades play.",
    "Each ruby there,",
    "Or pearl that dare appear,",
    "Be its own blush, be its own tear.",
    "A well-tam\u2019d heart,",
    "For whose more noble smart",
    "Love may be long choosing a dart.",
    "Eyes, that bestow",
    "Full quivers on Love\u2019s bow,",
    "Yet pay less arrows than they owe.",
    "Smiles, that can warm",
    "The blood, yet teach a charm,",
    "That chastity shall take no harm.",
    "Blushes, that bin",
    "The burnish of no sin,",
    "Nor flames of aught too hot within.",
    "Joys, that confess",
    "Virtue their mistress,",
    "And have no other head to dress.",
    "Fears, fond and flight",
    "As the coy bride\u2019s when night",
    "First does the longing lover right.",
    "Tears, quickly fled,",
    "And vain, as those are shed",
    "For a dying maidenhead.",
    "Days, that need borrow",
    "No part of their good morrow",
    "From a forespent night of sorrow.",
    "Days, that in spite",
    "Of darkness, by the light",
    "Of a clear mind are day all night.",
    "Nights, sweet as they,",
    "Made short by lovers\u2019 play,",
    "Yet long by th\u2019 absence of the day.",
    "Life, that dares send",
    "A challenge to his end,",
    "And when it comes say, \u201cWelcome friend.\u201d",
    "Sidneian showers",
    "Of sweet discourse, whose powers",
    "Can crown old Winter\u2019s head with flowers.",
    "Soft silken hours,",
    "Open suns, shady bowers,",
    "\u2019Bove all, nothing within that lours.",
    "Whate\u2019er delight",
    "Can make Day\u2019s forehead bright,",
    "Or give down to the wings of Night.",
    "In her whole frame",
    "Have nature all the name,",
    "Art and ornament the shame.",
    "Her flattery,",
    "Picture and poesy,",
    "Her counsel her own virtue be.",
    "I wish, her store",
    "Of worth may leave her poor",
    "Of wishes, and I wish\u2014no more.",
    "Now if time knows",
    "That her whose radiant brows",
    "Weave them a garland of my vows,",
    "Her whose just bays",
    "My future hopes can raise,",
    "A trophy to her present praise;",
    "Her that dares be",
    "What these lines wish to see:",
    "I seek no further, it is she.",
    "\u2019Tis she, and here,",
    "Lo, I unclothe and clear",
    "My wishes\u2019 cloudy character.",
    "May she enjoy it,",
    "Whose merit dare apply it,",
    "But modesty dares still deny it.",
    "Such worth as this is",
    "Shall fix my flying wishes,",
    "And determine them to kisses.",
    "Let her full glory,",
    "My fancies, fly before ye;",
    "Be ye my fictions; but her story."
