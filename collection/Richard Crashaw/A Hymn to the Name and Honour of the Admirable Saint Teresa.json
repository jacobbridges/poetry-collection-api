    "Love, thou are absolute sole lord",
    "Of life and death. To prove the word,",
    "We\u2019ll now appeal to none of all",
    "Those thy old soldiers, great and tall,",
    "Ripe men of martyrdom, that could reach down",
    "With strong arms their triumphant crown;",
    "Such as could with lusty breath",
    "Speak loud into the face of death",
    "Their great Lord\u2019s glorious name; to none",
    "Of those whose spacious bosoms spread a throne",
    "For love at large to fill; spare blood and sweat,",
    "And see him take a private seat,",
    "Making his mansion in the mild",
    "And milky soul of a soft child.",
    "Scarce has she learn\u2019d to lisp the name",
    "Of martyr, yet she thinks it shame",
    "Life should so long play with that breath",
    "Which spent can buy so brave a death.",
    "She never undertook to know",
    "What death with love should have to do;",
    "Nor has she e\u2019er yet understood",
    "Why to show love she should shed blood;",
    "Yet though she cannot tell you why,",
    "She can love, and she can die.",
    "Scarce has she blood enough to make",
    "A guilty sword blush for her sake;",
    "Yet has she\u2019a heart dares hope to prove",
    "How much less strong is death than love.",
    "Be love but there, let poor six years",
    "Be pos\u2019d with the maturest fears",
    "Man trembles at, you straight shall find",
    "Love knows no nonage, nor the mind.",
    "\u2019Tis love, not years or limbs that can",
    "Make the martyr, or the man.",
    "Love touch\u2019d her heart, and lo it beats",
    "High, and burns with such brave heats,",
    "Such thirsts to die, as dares drink up",
    "A thousand cold deaths in one cup.",
    "Good reason, for she breathes all fire;",
    "Her weak breast heaves with strong desire",
    "Of what she may with fruitless wishes",
    "Seek for amongst her mother\u2019s kisses.",
    "Since \u2019tis not to be had at home,",
    "She\u2019ll travel to a martyrdom.",
    "No home for hers confesses she",
    "But where she may a martyr be.",
    "She\u2019ll to the Moors, and trade with them",
    "For this unvalued diadem.",
    "She\u2019ll offer them her dearest breath,",
    "With Christ\u2019s name in \u2019t, in change for death.",
    "She\u2019ll bargain with them, and will give",
    "Them God; teach them how to live",
    "In him; or, if they this deny,",
    "For him she\u2019ll teach them how to die.",
    "So shall she leave amongst them sown",
    "Her Lord\u2019s blood, or at least her own.",
    "Farewell then, all the world, adieu!",
    "Teresa is no more for you.",
    "Farewell, all pleasures, sports, and joys,",
    "(Never till now esteemed toys)",
    "Farewell, whatever dear may be,",
    "Mother\u2019s arms or father\u2019s knee,",
    "Farewell house and farewell home,",
    "She\u2019s for the Moors, and martyrdom!",
    "Sweet, not so fast! lo, thy fair spouse,",
    "Whom thou seek\u2019st with so swift vows,",
    "Calls thee back, and bids thee come",
    "T\u2019 embrace a milder martyrdom.",
    "Blest powers forbid thy tender life",
    "Should bleed upon a barbarous knife;",
    "Or some base hand have power to rase",
    "Thy breast\u2019s chaste cabinet, and uncase",
    "A soul kept there so sweet; oh no,",
    "Wise Heav\u2019n will never have it so;",
    "Thou art Love\u2019s victim, and must die",
    "A death more mystical and high;",
    "Into Love\u2019s arms thou shalt let fall",
    "A still-surviving funeral.",
    "He is the dart must make the death",
    "Whose stroke shall taste thy hallow\u2019d breath;",
    "A dart thrice dipp\u2019d in that rich flame",
    "Which writes thy spouse\u2019s radiant name",
    "Upon the roof of heav\u2019n, where aye",
    "It shines, and with a sovereign ray",
    "Beats bright upon the burning faces",
    "Of souls, which in that name\u2019s sweet graces",
    "Find everlasting smiles. So rare,",
    "So spiritual, pure, and fair",
    "Must be th\u2019 immortal instrument",
    "Upon whose choice point shall be sent",
    "A life so lov\u2019d; and that there be",
    "Fit executioners for thee,",
    "The fair\u2019st and first-born sons of fire,",
    "Blest Seraphim, shall leave their quire",
    "And turn Love\u2019s soldiers, upon thee",
    "To exercise their archery.",
    "Oh, how oft shalt thou complain",
    "Of a sweet and subtle pain,",
    "Of intolerable joys,",
    "Of a death in which who dies",
    "Loves his death, and dies again,",
    "And would forever so be slain,",
    "And lives and dies, and knows not why",
    "To live, but that he thus may never leave to die.",
    "How kindly will thy gentle heart",
    "Kiss the sweetly-killing dart!",
    "And close in his embraces keep",
    "Those delicious wounds, that weep",
    "Balsam to heal themselves with. Thus",
    "When these thy deaths, so numerous,",
    "Shall all at last die into one,",
    "And melt thy soul\u2019s sweet mansion",
    "Like a soft lump of incense, hasted",
    "By too hot a fire, and wasted",
    "Into perfuming clouds, so fast",
    "Shalt thou exhale to Heav\u2019n at last",
    "In a resolving sigh; and then,",
    "O what? Ask not the tongues of men;",
    "Angels cannot tell; suffice,",
    "Thyself shall feel thine own full joys",
    "And hold them fast forever. There",
    "So soon as thou shalt first appear,",
    "The moon of maiden stars, thy white",
    "Mistress, attended by such bright",
    "Souls as thy shining self, shall come",
    "And in her first ranks make thee room;",
    "Where \u2019mongst her snowy family",
    "Immortal welcomes wait for thee.",
    "O what delight, when reveal\u2019d Life shall stand",
    "And teach thy lips heav\u2019n with his hand,",
    "On which thou now mayst to thy wishes",
    "Heap up thy consecrated kisses.",
    "What joys shall seize thy soul when she,",
    "Bending her blessed eyes on thee,",
    "(Those second smiles of heav\u2019n) shall dart",
    "Her mild rays through thy melting heart!",
    "Angels, thy old friends, there shall greet thee,",
    "Glad at their own home now to meet thee.",
    "All thy good works which went before",
    "And waited for thee, at the door,",
    "Shall own thee there, and all in one",
    "Weave a constellation",
    "Of crowns, with which the King, thy spouse,",
    "Shall build up thy triumphant brows.",
    "All thy old woes shall now smile on thee,",
    "And thy pains sit bright upon thee;",
    "All thy sorrows here shall shine,",
    "All thy suff\u2019rings be divine;",
    "Tears shall take comfort and turn gems,",
    "And wrongs repent to diadems.",
    "Ev\u2019n thy deaths shall live, and new",
    "Dress the soul that erst they slew;",
    "Thy wounds shall blush to such bright scars",
    "As keep account of the Lamb\u2019s wars.",
    "Those rare works where thou shalt leave writ",
    "Love\u2019s noble history, with wit",
    "Taught thee by none but him, while here",
    "They feed our souls, shall clothe thine there.",
    "Each heav\u2019nly word by whose hid flame",
    "Our hard hearts shall strike fire, the same",
    "Shall flourish on thy brows, and be",
    "Both fire to us and flame to thee,",
    "Whose light shall live bright in thy face",
    "By glory, in our hearts by grace.",
    "Thou shalt look round about and see",
    "Thousands of crown\u2019d souls throng to be",
    "Themselves thy crown; sons of thy vows,",
    "The virgin-births with which thy sovereign spouse",
    "Made fruitful thy fair soul, go now",
    "And with them all about thee, bow",
    "To him. \u201cPut on,\u201d he\u2019ll say, \u201cput on,",
    "My rosy love, that thy rich zone",
    "Sparkling with the sacred flames",
    "Of thousand souls whose happy names",
    "Heav\u2019n keeps upon thy score. Thy bright",
    "Life brought them first to kiss the light",
    "That kindled them to stars.\u201d And so",
    "Thou with the Lamb, thy Lord, shalt go,",
    "And wheresoe\u2019er he sets his white",
    "Steps, walk with him those ways of light",
    "Which who in death would live to see",
    "Must learn in life to die like thee."
