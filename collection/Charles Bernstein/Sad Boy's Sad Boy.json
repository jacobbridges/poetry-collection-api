    "I ruin my hats and all the mat slides glad",
    "I hop my girls and all is skip again",
    "I jump I run you up inside my truck",
    "The car goes looping out in dark and light",
    "And yellow hat slides in",
    "I run my mats and all the girl slides glad",
    "I hoped you skipped me into luck",
    "And jump me black, ruin me glad",
    "I jump I run you up inside my truck",
    "I jump my slopes and all the dopes slide glad",
    "I glide my luck and all is slip again",
    "I jump my hopes and all the rope glides sad",
    "I skip you jump the way you said",
    "But I run old and sigh your name",
    "I ruin my mats and all the girl slides glad",
    "At least when luck hops it skips back again",
    "A rune my mats and all the girls slide glad",
    "I jump I run you up inside my truck"
