    "My father\u2019s dying",
    "resembles nothing so much",
    "as a small village",
    "building itself",
    "in the mind of a traveler",
    "who reads about it",
    "and thinks to go there.",
    "The journey is imagined",
    "in a way not even felt",
    "as when years ago",
    "I knew my father would die someday.",
    "The idea came up as fast",
    "as a curve in a road",
    "which opens out",
    "to an unexpected vista,",
    "and now in this journey",
    "the road gravel crunches",
    "under my tires. I miss",
    "some of the streets,",
    "get lost, get lost.",
    "I find I\u2019m no tourist anymore",
    "and settle into the oldest human assignment.",
    "Bury your father and live forever",
    "as a stranger in that town."
