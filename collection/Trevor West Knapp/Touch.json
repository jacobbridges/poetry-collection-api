    "We speak of the pain of childbirth, referring,",
    "of course, to the mother, but what is pain",
    "to the mother, the one through whose body",
    "the course unwinds? She understands already",
    "what kind of world she must return to,",
    "how it daily hones its many edges",
    "against human skin, unlike the child whose",
    "untried limbs inch toward it, pressing now",
    "so firmly against her he feels for the first time",
    "the pinch of bone against bone and is seared",
    "by the friction. Isn't he the one",
    "on whom the real burden falls, the one",
    "to whom resilience means nothing yet? His",
    "tender skin like a small measure of cloth",
    "unfolding before the blade under which",
    "he will, for a lifetime, bruise",
    "and heal: Crush of the long descent, grip",
    "of the steadying hands, brush of breath",
    "against cheek, even the constant barrage",
    "of the microscopic, the tiny plink-plink",
    "of the dust motes knocking against him",
    "before custom makes him numb to it. No wonder",
    "the startled mouth cries out,",
    "each pore suddenly hungry",
    "in the withering, nourishing light."
