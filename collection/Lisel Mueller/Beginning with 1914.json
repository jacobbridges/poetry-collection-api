    "Since it always begins",
    "in the unlikeliest place",
    "we start in an obsolete country",
    "on no current map. The camera",
    "glides over flower beds,",
    "for this is a southern climate.",
    "We focus on medals, a horse,",
    "on a white uniform,",
    "for this is June. The young man",
    "waves to the people lining the road,",
    "he lifts a child, he catches",
    "a rose from a wrinkled woman",
    "in a blue kerchief. Then we hear shots",
    "and close in on a casket",
    "draped in the Austrian flag.",
    "Thirty-one days torn off a calendar.",
    "Bombs on Belgrade; then Europe explodes.",
    "We watch the trenches fill with men,",
    "the air with live ammunition.",
    "A close-up of a five-year-old",
    "living on turnips. Her older sister,",
    "my not-yet-mother, already",
    "wearing my daughter\u2019s eyes,",
    "is reading a letter as we cut",
    "to a young man with thick glasses",
    "who lies in a trench and writes",
    "a study of Ibsen. I recognize him,",
    "he is going to be my father,",
    "and this is his way of keeping alive.",
    "Snow. Blood. Lice. Frostbite.",
    "Grenades. Stretchers. Coffins. Snow.",
    "Telegrams with black borders.",
    "On the wide screen my father returns",
    "bringing his brother\u2019s body;",
    "my mother\u2019s father brings back his son\u2019s",
    "from the opposite edge. They come together",
    "under the oaks of the cemetery.",
    "All who will be my family",
    "are here, except my sister,",
    "who is not yet imagined.",
    "Neither am I, who imagine",
    "this picture, who now jump",
    "to my snowy birthday in the year",
    "of the million-mark loaf of bread.",
    "My early years are played",
    "by a blue-eyed child who grows up",
    "quickly, for this is a film",
    "of highlights, like all documentaries",
    "false to the life\u2014the work",
    "of selective memory, all I can bear",
    "of a painful childhood. The swastika",
    "appears and remains as the huge",
    "backdrop against which we\u2019re seen.",
    "The sound track of a hysterical voice",
    "is threatening us. We\u2019re heard as whispers.",
    "Shortly before my city",
    "bursts into flames, my stand-in",
    "disappears from the film, which continues",
    "with scenes of terror and death",
    "I can\u2019t bear to watch. I pick up",
    "a new reel, a strange sequel",
    "set in a different location",
    "and made in another language,",
    "in which I am back. The colors are bright,",
    "the sound track is filled with music,",
    "the focus gentle. A man is beside me.",
    "Time-lapse photography picks up",
    "the inchmeal growth of daughters",
    "toward the sky, the slow subversion",
    "of dark by gray hair. Little happens.",
    "The camera sums up the even flow",
    "of many years in a shot of a river.",
    "The principals from part one",
    "are missing, except for me",
    "who am the connection. The time is now,",
    "and I am playing myself."
