    "Sometimes, when the light strikes at odd angles",
    "and pulls you back into childhood",
    "and you are passing a crumbling mansion",
    "completely hidden behind old willows",
    "or an empty convent guarded by hemlocks",
    "and giant firs standing hip to hip,",
    "you know again that behind that wall,",
    "under the uncut hair of the willows",
    "something secret is going on,",
    "so marvelous and dangerous",
    "that if you crawled through and saw,",
    "you would die, or be happy forever."
