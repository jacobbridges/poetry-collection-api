    "In the America of the dream",
    "the first rise of the moon",
    "swings free of the ocean,",
    "and she reigns in her shining flesh",
    "over a good, great valley",
    "of plumped, untrampled grasses",
    "and beasts with solemn eyes,",
    "of lovers infallibly pitched",
    "in their ascendant phase.",
    "In this America, death",
    "is virginal also, roaming",
    "the good, great valley",
    "in his huge boots, his shadow",
    "steady and lean, his pistol",
    "silver, his greeting clear",
    "and courteous as a stranger\u2019s",
    "who looks for another, a mind",
    "to share his peaceable evenings.",
    "Dreaming, we are another",
    "race than the one which wakes",
    "in the cold sweat of fear,",
    "fires wild shots at death.,",
    "builds slippery towers of glass",
    "to head him off, waylays him",
    "with alcohol traps, rides him down",
    "in canyons of sex, and hides",
    "in teetering ghost towns.",
    "Dreaming, we are the mad",
    "who swear by the blood of trees",
    "and speak with the tongues of streams",
    "through props of steel and sawdust,",
    "a colony of souls",
    "ravaged by visions, bound",
    "to some wild, secret cove",
    "not yet possessed, a place",
    "still innocent of us."
