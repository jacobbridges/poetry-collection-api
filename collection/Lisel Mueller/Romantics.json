    "The modern biographers worry",
    "\u201chow far it went,\u201d their tender friendship.",
    "They wonder just what it means",
    "when he writes he thinks of her constantly,",
    "his guardian angel, beloved friend.",
    "The modern biographers ask",
    "the rude, irrelevant question",
    "of our age, as if the event",
    "of two bodies meshing together",
    "establishes the degree of love,",
    "forgetting how softly Eros walked",
    "in the nineteenth-century, how a hand",
    "held overlong or a gaze anchored",
    "in someone\u2019s eyes could unseat a heart,",
    "and nuances of address not known",
    "in our egalitarian language",
    "could make the redolent air",
    "tremble and shimmer with the heat",
    "of possibility. Each time I hear",
    "the Intermezzi, sad",
    "and lavish in their tenderness,",
    "I imagine the two of them",
    "sitting in a garden",
    "among late-blooming roses",
    "and dark cascades of leaves,",
    "letting the landscape speak for them,",
    "leaving us nothing to overhear."
