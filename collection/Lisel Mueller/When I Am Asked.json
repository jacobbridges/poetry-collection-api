    "how I began writing poems,",
    "I talk about the indifference of nature.",
    "It was soon after my mother died,",
    "a brilliant June day,",
    "everything blooming.",
    "I sat on a gray stone bench",
    "in a lovingly planted garden,",
    "but the day lilies were as deaf",
    "as the ears of drunken sleepers",
    "and the roses curved inward.",
    "Nothing was black or broken",
    "and not a leaf fell",
    "and the sun blared endless commercials",
    "for summer holidays.",
    "I sat on a gray stone bench",
    "ringed with the ingenue faces",
    "of pink and white impatiens",
    "and placed my grief",
    "in the mouth of language,",
    "the only thing that would grieve with me."
