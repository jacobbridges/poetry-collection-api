    "Outside the house the wind is howling",
    "and the trees are creaking horribly.",
    "This is an old story",
    "with its old beginning,",
    "as I lay me down to sleep.",
    "But when I wake up, sunlight",
    "has taken over the room.",
    "You have already made the coffee",
    "and the radio brings us music",
    "from a confident age. In the paper",
    "bad news is set in distant places.",
    "Whatever was bound to happen",
    "in my story did not happen.",
    "But I know there are rules that cannot be broken.",
    "Perhaps a name was changed.",
    "A small mistake. Perhaps",
    "a woman I do not know",
    "is facing the day with the heavy heart",
    "that, by all rights, should have been mine."
