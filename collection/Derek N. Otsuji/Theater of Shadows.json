    "Nights we could not sleep\u2014",
    "summer insects singing in dry heat,",
    "short-circuiting the nerves\u2014",
    "Grandma would light a lamp,",
    "at the center of our narrow room,",
    "whose clean conspiracy of light",
    "whispered to the tall blank walls,",
    "illuminating them suddenly",
    "like the canvas of a dream.",
    "Between the lamp and wall",
    "her arthritic wrists grew pliant",
    "as she molded and cast",
    "improbable animal shapes moving",
    "on the wordless screen:",
    "A blackbird, like a mynah, not a crow.",
    "A dark horse\u2019s head that could but would not talk.",
    "An ashen rabbit (her elusive self)",
    "triggered in snow",
    "that a quivering touch (like death\u2019s)",
    "sent scampering into the wings",
    "of that little theater of shadows",
    "that eased us into dreams."
