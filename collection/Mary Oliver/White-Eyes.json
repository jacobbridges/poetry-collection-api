    "In winter",
    "all the singing is in",
    "the tops of the trees",
    "where the wind-bird",
    "with its white eyes",
    "shoves and pushes",
    "among the branches.",
    "Like any of us",
    "he wants to go to sleep,",
    "but he's restless\u2014",
    "he has an idea,",
    "and slowly it unfolds",
    "from under his beating wings",
    "as long as he stays awake.",
    "But his big, round music, after all,",
    "is too breathy to last.",
    "So, it's over.",
    "In the pine-crown",
    "he makes his nest,",
    "he's done all he can.",
    "I don't know the name of this bird,",
    "I only imagine his glittering beak",
    "tucked in a white wing",
    "while the clouds\u2014",
    "which he has summoned",
    "from the north\u2014",
    "which he has taught",
    "to be mild, and silent\u2014",
    "thicken, and begin to fall",
    "into the world below",
    "like stars, or the feathers",
    "of some unimaginable bird",
    "that loves us,",
    "that is asleep now, and silent\u2014",
    "that has turned itself",
    "into snow."
