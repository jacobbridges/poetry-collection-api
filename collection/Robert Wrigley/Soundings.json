    "The birdhouse made from a gourd is wired",
    "to a flanged loop of steel and screwed to the southeast post",
    "of the shack. Two holes at the top\u2014near where the stem was,",
    "for a thong of leather to hang it by, which long ago broke\u2014",
    "are now the fingerholes of the mournful wind instrument it\u2019s become.",
    "The broad round bowl of it makes a sort of birdly",
    "that pearls through the steel, into the post,",
    "the floor joists and walls in two notes: a slightly sharp D",
    "and an equally sharp F, says the guitar tuner,",
    "which explains why all my thinking these days",
    "is in B-flat, a difficult key for all but the clarinet",
    "and this sudden covey of nuthatches, whose collective woe",
    "makes it a minor chord I am in the middle of.",
    "Nothing to do but hoist such silks as the luff",
    "of limbs and needles suggests, and sail on,",
    "the barely-escaped-from-the-cat chipmunk chattering",
    "like a gull, and the mountain\u2019s last drift of snow",
    "resembling the back of a sounding whale. Hear the thrum of the rigging,",
    "Daggoo? Hear its profoundest woo, its sensible gobbledy-goo",
    "and doo-wop, the boo-hoos of the spheres, by vectors and veers,",
    "by tacks and refractal jabberings, taking us deeper into the weirdness",
    "of the ghost sea those prairie hills were the bottom of once,",
    "this nowhere we shall not be returning from.",
    "Draw the lines! Assume the crow\u2019s nest, Pip. This ship",
    "sails on music and wind, and away with birds."
