    "Sleepy and suburban at dusk,",
    "I learn again the yard\u2019s",
    "geometry, edging around the garden",
    "and the weedy knots of flowers, circling",
    "trees and shrubs, giving",
    "a wide berth to the berry patch,",
    "heavy and sprawled out of its bounds.",
    "Shoving such a machine",
    "around a fairway of dandelions,",
    "it is easy to feel absurd.",
    "The average lawn, left alone",
    "one hundred years, could become",
    "a hardwood forest. An admirable project.",
    "Still I carry on, following week on week",
    "the same mowing pattern, cutting edges,",
    "almost sprinting the last narrow swaths.",
    "And tonight, as I mow over",
    "the bushels of fallen peaches,",
    "sending pits soaring over the neighbors\u2019 fences,",
    "seems hardly any different.",
    "But on one crooked march I walk",
    "across the thin hidden hole",
    "to a yellowjacket hive. The blade pulls",
    "them up from their deep sweet chamber",
    "just as my bare legs go by.",
    "A bee lands heavily,",
    "all blunder and revenge, and the sting",
    "is a quick embrace and release,",
    "like the dared kid\u2019s run and touch",
    "of a blind man. I\u2019m blind now",
    "with the shock and pain of it,",
    "howling in a sprint toward the house,",
    "the mower flopped on its side, wild blade loose",
    "in the darkening air.",
    "Later,",
    "the motor sputtered quiet, starved by tilt,",
    "I\u2019m back in the twilight,",
    "a half-dozen stings packed in wet tobacco,",
    "carrying a can of gasoline, a five-foot torch.",
    "The destruction is easy: shove can",
    "slow to entranceway lip, pull",
    "back and light torch, use torch",
    "to tip can. One low",
    "and it\u2019s over.",
    "A few flaming drones flutter out and fall.",
    "Stragglers, late returners, cruise",
    "wide circles around the ruins.",
    "In the cool September night they fly",
    "or die. In the morning I finish my chores.",
    "All the way to winter the blackened hole",
    "remains. On Christmas Eve a light",
    "late snow covers it and all",
    "the lawn\u2019s other imperfections: crabgrass",
    "hummocks, high maple roots,",
    "the mushroom-laden fairy ring that defies",
    "obliteration and appears every spring",
    "more visible than ever. Standing",
    "in the window, the scent",
    "of pine powerful around me,",
    "the snap of wood undoing itself in the stove,",
    "I wonder at this thin and cold",
    "camouflage, falling,",
    "gradually falling over what has gone",
    "and grown before. And I hear",
    "that other rattle and report, that engine",
    "driven by another fire. I think of a gold",
    "that is sweet and unguent, a gold",
    "that is a blaze of years behind me.",
    "I hear wind in its regular passes",
    "blowing across the roof,",
    "feel in my legs a minute and icy tingling,",
    "as though I have stood too long",
    "in one place or made again another wrong step,",
    "as though the present itself",
    "were a kind of memory, coiled, waiting,",
    "dying to be seen from tomorrow."
