    "As a hoodoo-voodoo, get-you-back-to-me tool,",
    "this hank\u2019s thankless task is vast,",
    "a head down to the ground impossibility, possibly,",
    "since what I\u2019m thinking of is your toe pad pinknesses too,",
    "your soup hots and round-and-rounds, the fine",
    "and perfect poundage of you on my paws, the very cause",
    "and problem I moan and bemoan",
    "the absence of. For Love, above the head",
    "this reddish coil once lavishly wore, there\u2019s an air so far away",
    "it\u2019s sad for me to even think the same sun\u2019s rays play",
    "where it was and do to you what I would do",
    "if I were there or you were here. Still, some thrills",
    "remembered do resemble thrills, one hopes, and the ropes",
    "of it that gently fell around me bound me so well",
    "no hell of miles can defile this dream I dream. I mean",
    "the anyway DNA I can find of you. I mean the home",
    "of bones and blood that holds the whole of you",
    "and which this fizzed-up missive means to conjure, missy,",
    "my world in a curl, girl, this man oh man half man I am",
    "when you\u2019re gone."
