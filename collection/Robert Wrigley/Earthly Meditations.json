    "1",
    "Spring, and the first full crop of dandelions gone",
    "to smoke, the lawn lumpish with goldfinches,",
    "hunched in their fluffs, fattened by seed,",
    "alight in the wind-bared peduncular forest.",
    "Little bells, they loop and dive, bend",
    "the delicate birch branches down.",
    "I would enter the sky through the soil",
    "myself, sing up the snail bowers",
    "and go on the lam with the roots.",
    "Licked by filaments, I would lie,",
    "a billion love-mouths to suckle and feed.",
    "Where the river will be next week,",
    "a puddle two trout go savagely dying in.",
    "Notice the bland, Darwinian sand: bone wrack",
    "and tree skin, the ground down moon bowls",
    "of mussels, viral stones dividing like mold.",
    "At twelve, I buried the frog because it was dead",
    "and dug it up because I'd been dreaming\u2014",
    "a fish belly light, a lowly chirruped chorus",
    "of amens. I thought my nights might smell of hell.",
    "Bland, hum-drum, quotidian guilt\u2014",
    "if I've killed one frog, I've killed two.",
    "Saint Rot and the sacraments of maggots:",
    "knowing is humus and sustenance is sex.",
    "It accrues and accrues, it stews",
    "tumorous with delight. Tomorrow's",
    "a shovelful, the spit of the cosmos, one day",
    "the baby's breath is no longer a rose."
