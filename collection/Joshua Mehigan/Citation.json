    "Their ruler is elected state by state,",

    "They have their MMR and Retrovir.",
    "They have their quarter-century more life.",
    "Each commoner receives a welcome mat.",
    "The maids have maids, and plumbers go to Paris.",
    "They call their waiters \"sir.\" The poor are fat.",
    "They eat. They do not easily embarrass."
