    "The cement plant was like a huge still",
    "nailed in gray corrugated panels",
    "and left out forty-five years ago",
    "in the null center of a meadow",
    "to tax itself to remorseless death",
    "near a black stream and briars, where",
    "from the moment it began to breathe,",
    "it began falling apart and burning.",
    "But it still went, and the men were paid.",
    "The plant made dust. Impalpably fine,",
    "hung in a tawny alkaline cloud,",
    "swept into drifts against mill room piers,",
    "frozen by rain on silo ledges,",
    "dust was its first and its final cause.",
    "Pinups were traced on their car windshields.",
    "Dust gave them jobs, and killed some of them.",
    "Late into evening their teeth grated.",
    "Its product was dust, its problem dust.",
    "The thing was blind to all its own ends",
    "but the one. Men\u2019s ordinary lives,",
    "measured out on a scale alien",
    "to that on which its life was measured,",
    "were spent in crawling the junk machine,",
    "fitting new gaskets, screws, and bearings,",
    "deceiving it towards the mood required",
    "for it to avail and pay. Somehow",
    "it did. None cheered it. It sustained them."
