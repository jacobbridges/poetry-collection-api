    "The fair rolled into town surprisingly",
    "intact, like a plate unbreakable because",
    "it has been dropped and glued so many times",
    "that it is all glue and no plate. The fair",
    "was no fair. But, oh, it was a thrill!",
    "The fair slid into town just as a clown",
    "slides into pants. The fit was loose but right.",
    "The sheriff had a job directing traffic.",
    "The barber was the sheriff for a night,",
    "and people paid to see a human ape.",
    "They frowned to find her happy and alive.",
    "The fair spilled into town like a box of tacks.",
    "Later that month, in with the rest at church,",
    "were people no one knew,",
    "though none could tell exactly who was who."
