    "Eyelids, fall softly, from their gritted corners",
    "chalk, let it drizzle,",
    "let the streams flow",
    "thick with a waste glaze, let imagery run off",
    "its surplus of kaolin, choke feed of sediment",
    "plumed into the blue,",
    "tulipping its stem.",
    "Cress bunches thickening in shallows, flukes",
    "stinging flank heifers in their shove and jostle",
    "down a bank, drinking,",
    "mud caking lips.",
    "Eyelids, fall softly, let me linger interrupted",
    "behind the curtains billowing with images,",
    "how the unseeable",
    "sill even so snags, how",
    "the very point lights from behind, thoughts",
    "dispersing into folds slung aloft in sea mist,",
    "impermissible point",
    "breaks every motive",
    "falling back behind the eyelids that then fall.",
    "I breathe, I look, I carry forward, I can sense",
    "the last of you, taking",
    "walks of air thick with",
    "waste breath your form displaces. O curtain!",
    "O rail! I hate the thick floor beneath, breathe",
    "over a market quarrel,",
    "rise over the bass",
    "sawing at its stems to crash down the vault,",
    "let the vault branch recklessly, light-streams",
    "maze, air\u2019s stirring",
    "carry song back and forth;",
    "I hear your recorder pipe, long for its repeats",
    "giving what-for to earth seeming to attenuate,",
    "rock is marked",
    "with your aeolian flow.",
    "Eyelids, fall softly, the cast of their fluttering",
    "fans across the inlet a white shadow, writes",
    "over deep-set floor",
    "captivated ripples.",
    "World, gaze out! Rise from a shrouded point."
