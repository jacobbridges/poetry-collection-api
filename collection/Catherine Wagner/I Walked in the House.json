    "I walked in the house",
    "on the flat aspect of the wood",
    "I took rectangular instruction of the wood",
    "when I walked I turned at the wall",
    "and on the flat I moved steadily",
    "unimpeded, not tumbling, climbing or short of breath.",
    "I walked in ease on the flat.",
    "Something electric charged into our account",
    "and zinged out of it, pre-instructed",
    "and paid for the house. I felt",
    "house on my heel then instep and toe.",
    "I had a bad foot and I paid",
    "to get it fixed so I could walk here.",
    "I paid for the house and I paid for the",
    "foot that touches it. I paid to be",
    "directed rectangularly and down a hall.",
    "I curved my body to direct",
    "my waste through a hole. I am helped",
    "and paying for it.",
    "all of me exchanged,",
    "housing exchange.",
    "I saw us standing",
    "up in the world.",
    "And we sank into",
    "exchange",
    "vibrating transparency",
    "like a sea nettle",
    "afloat in the night sea",
    "the edges of the sea-veil",
    "tensed slapping above, visible",
    "when the wind crevassed and doilied",
    "If there is a ceiling to exchange",
    "and above it sky",
    "I don\u2019t can\u2019t see it and I don\u2019t know why",
    "I want it",
    "above my house which is crystalline gel edges",
    "because the whole world\u2019s disappeared",
    "viewed as exchange",
    "I broke my arm and the window",
    "integrally to exchange.",
    "I paid someone to fix me and improve",
    "the window, triple-glazing it, and warmer",
    "I rebounded knit in knit up.",
    "All parties to the event\u2019s aftermath",
    "were paid.",
    "Suppose I did not go in pain",
    "to hospital, did not visit and revisit",
    "for x-rays, left the window smashed",
    "and sat here by it,",
    "stuck up",
    "among the crystalline",
    "and cold.",

    "not to play, and with the other unemployed",
    "weighed \u2014",
    "the ghostship",
    "sagged with holes.",
    "\u2014So you want to be a thing outside exchange?",
    "Drain out the dying bath",
    "see what color you are?",
    "The coin changed hands",
    "identical with a will",
    "to transact."
