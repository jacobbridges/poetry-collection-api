    "Soft falls the shower, the thunders cease!",
    "And see the messenger of peace",
    "Illumes the eastern skies;",
    "Blest sign of firm unchanging love!",
    "While others seek the cause to prove,",
    "That bids thy beauties rise.",
    "My soul, content with humbler views,",
    "Well pleased admires thy varied hues,",
    "And can with joy behold",
    "Thy beauteous form, and wondering gaze",
    "Enraptured on thy mingled rays",
    "Of purple, green, and gold.",
    "Enough for me to deem divine",
    "The hand that paints each glowing line;",
    "To think that thou art given",
    "A transient gleam of that bright place",
    "Where Beauty owns celestial grace,",
    "A faint display of Heaven!"
