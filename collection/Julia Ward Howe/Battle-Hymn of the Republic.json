    "Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord:",
    "He is trampling out the vintage where the grapes of wrath are stored;",
    "He hath loosed the fatal lightning of his terrible swift sword:",
    "His truth is marching on.",
    "I have seen Him in the watch-fires of a hundred circling camps;",
    "They have builded Him an altar in the evening dews and damps;",
    "I can read His righteous sentence by the dim and flaring lamps.",
    "His Day is marching on.",
    "I have read a fiery gospel, writ in burnished rows of steel:",
    "\u201cAs ye deal with my contemners, so with you my grace shall deal;",
    "Let the Hero, born of woman, crush the serpent with his heel,",
    "Since God is marching on.\u201d",
    "He has sounded forth the trumpet that shall never call retreat;",
    "He is sifting out the hearts of men before his judgment-seat:",
    "Oh! be swift, my soul, to answer Him! be jubilant, my feet!",
    "Our God is marching on.",
    "In the beauty of the lilies Christ was born across the sea,",
    "With a glory in his bosom that transfigures you and me:",
    "As he died to make men holy, let us die to make men free,",
    "While God is marching on."
