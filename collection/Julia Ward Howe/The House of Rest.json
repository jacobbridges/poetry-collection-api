    "I will build a house of rest,",
    "Square the corners every one:",
    "At each angle on his breast",
    "Shall a cherub take the sun;",
    "Rising, risen, sinking, down,",
    "Weaving day\u2019s unequal crown.",
    "In the chambers, light as air,",
    "Shall responsive footsteps fall:",
    "Brother, sister, art thou there?",
    "Hush! we need not jar nor call;",
    "Need not turn to seek the face",
    "Shut in rapture\u2019s hiding-place.",
    "Heavy load and mocking care",
    "Shall from back and bosom part;",
    "Thought shall reach the thrill of prayer,",
    "Patience plan the dome of art.",
    "None shall praise or merit claim,",
    "Not a joy be called by name.",
    "With a free, unmeasured tread",
    "Shall we pace the cloisters through:",
    "Rest, enfranchised, like the Dead;",
    "Rest till Love be born anew.",
    "Weary Thought shall take his time,",
    "Free of task-work, loosed from rhyme.",
    "No reproof shall grieve or chill;",
    "Every sin doth stand confest;",
    "None need murmur, \u2018This was ill\u2019:",
    "Therefore do they grant us rest;",
    "Contemplation making whole",
    "Every ruin of the soul.",
    "Pictures shall as softly look",
    "As in distance shows delight;",
    "Slowly shall each saintly book",
    "Turn its pages in our sight;",
    "Not the study\u2019s wealth confuse,",
    "Urging zeal to pale abuse.",
    "Children through the windows peep,",
    "Not reproachful, though our own;",
    "Hushed the parent passion deep,",
    "And the household\u2019s eager tone.",
    "One above, divine and true,",
    "Makes us children like to you.",
    "Measured bread shall build us up",
    "At the hospitable board;",
    "In Contentment\u2019s golden cup",
    "Is the guileless liquor poured.",
    "May the beggar pledge the king",
    "In that spirit gathering,",
    "Oh! my house is far away;",
    "Yet it sometimes shuts me in.",
    "Imperfection mars each day",
    "While the perfect works begin.",
    "In the house of labor best",
    "Can I build the house of rest."
