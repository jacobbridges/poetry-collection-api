    "I never",
    "a poem, dear friend\u0097",
    "I never sat me down, and said,",

    "is writ?",
    "'T is thus\u0097through weary length of days,",
    "I bear a thought within my breast",
    "That greatens from my growth of soul,",
    "And waits, and will not be expressed.",
    "It greatens, till its hour has come,",
    "Not without pain, it sees the light;",
    "'Twixt smiles and tears I view it o'er,",
    "And dare not deem it perfect, quite.",
    "These children of my soul I keep",
    "Where scarce a mortal man may see,",
    "Yet not unconsecrate, dear friend,",
    "Baptismal rites they claim of thee."
