    "All afternoon his tractor pulls a flat wagon",
    "with bales to the barn, then back to the waiting",
    "chopped field. It trails a feather of smoke.",
    "Down the block we bend with the season:",
    "shoes to polish for a big game,",
    "storm windows to batten or patch.",
    "And how like a field is the whole sky now",
    "that the maples have shed their leaves, too.",
    "It makes us believers\u2014stationed in groups,",
    "leaning on rakes, looking into space. We rub blisters",
    "over billows of leaf smoke. Or stand alone,",
    "bagging gold for the cold days to come."
