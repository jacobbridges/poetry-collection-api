    "He is tight at first, stiff, stands there atilt",
    "tossing the green fluff tennis ball down",
    "the side alley, but soon he\u2019s limber,",
    "he\u2019s letting it fly and the black lab",
    "lops back each time. These are the true lovers,",
    "this dog, this man, and when the dog stops",
    "to pee, the old guy hurries him back, then",
    "hurls the ball farther away. Now his mother",
    "dodders out, she\u2019s old as the sky, wheeling",
    "her green tank with its sweet vein, breath.",
    "She tips down the path he\u2019s made for her,",
    "grass rippling but trim, soft underfoot,",
    "to survey the yard, every inch of it",
    "in fine blossom, set-stone, pruned miniature,",
    "split rails docked along the front walk,",
    "antique watering cans down-spread\u2014up",
    "huffs the dog again with his mouthy ball\u2014",
    "so flowers seem to spill out, red geraniums,",
    "grand blue asters, and something I have",
    "no name for, wild elsewhere in our world",
    "but here a thing to tend. To call for, and it comes."
