    "While you, great patron of mankind, sustain",
    "The balanc'd world, and open all the main;",
    "Your country, chief, in arms abroad defend,",
    "At home, with morals, arts, and laws amend;",
    "How shall the Muse, from such a monarch steal",
    "An hour, and not defraud the public weal?",
    "Edward and Henry, now the boast of fame,",
    "And virtuous Alfred, a more sacred name,",
    "After a life of gen'rous toils endur'd,",
    "The Gaul subdu'd, or property secur'd,",
    "Ambition humbled, mighty cities storm'd,",
    "Or laws establish'd, and the world reform'd;",
    "Clos'd their long glories with a sigh, to find",
    "Th' unwilling gratitude of base mankind!",
    "All human virtue, to its latest breath",
    "Finds envy never conquer'd, but by death.",
    "The great Alcides, ev'ry labour past,",
    "Had still this monster to subdue at last.",
    "Sure fate of all, beneath whose rising ray",
    "Each star of meaner merit fades away!",
    "Oppress'd we feel the beam directly beat,",
    "Those suns of glory please not till they set.",
    "To thee the world its present homage pays,",
    "The harvest early, but mature the praise:",
    "Great friend of liberty! in",
    "a name",
    "Above all Greek, above all Roman fame:",
    "Whose word is truth, as sacred and rever'd,",
    "As Heav'n's own oracles from altars heard.",
    "Wonder of kings! like whom, to mortal eyes",
    "None e'er has risen, and none e'er shall rise.",
    "Just in one instance, be it yet confest",
    "Your people, Sir, are partial in the rest:",
    "Foes to all living worth except your own,",
    "And advocates for folly dead and gone.",
    "Authors, like coins, grow dear as they grow old;",
    "It is the rust we value, not the gold.",
    "Chaucer's worst ribaldry is learn'd by rote,",

    "At ninety-nine, a modern and a dunce?",
    "\"We shall not quarrel for a year or two;",
    "By courtesy of England, he may do.\"",
    "Then by the rule that made the horsetail bare,",

    "In quibbles, angel and archangel join,",
    "And God the Father turns a school divine.",
    "Not that I'd lop the beauties from his book,",
    "Like slashing Bentley with his desp'rate hook,",
    "Or damn all Shakespeare, like th' affected fool",
    "At court, who hates whate'er he read at school.",
    "But for the wits of either Charles's days,",

    "On Avon's bank, where flow'rs eternal blow,",
    "If I but ask if any weed can grow?",
    "One tragic sentence if I dare deride,",

    "How will our fathers rise up in a rage,",
    "And swear, all shame is lost in George's age!",
    "You'd think no fools disgrac'd the former reign,",

    "And to debase the sons, exalts the sires.",
    "Had ancient times conspir'd to disallow",
    "What then was new, what had been ancient now?",
    "Or what remain'd, so worthy to be read",
    "By learned critics, of the mighty dead?",
    "In days of ease, when now the weary sword",

    "To worship like his fathers was his care;",
    "To teach their frugal virtues to his heir;",
    "To prove that luxury could never hold,",
    "And place, on good security, his gold.",
    "Now times are chang'd, and one poetic itch",
    "Has seiz'd the court and city, poor and rich:",
    "Sons, sires, and grandsires, all will wear the bays,",
    "Our wives read Milton, and our daughters plays,",
    "To theatres, and to rehearsals throng,",
    "And all our grace at table is a song.",
    "I, who so oft renounce the Muses, lie,",
    "Not {-}{-}{-}{-}{-}'s self e'er tells more fibs than I;",
    "When sick of Muse, our follies we deplore,",
    "And promise our best friends to rhyme no more;",

    "But verse, alas! your Majesty disdains;",
    "And I'm not us'd to panegyric strains:",
    "The zeal of fools offends at any time,",
