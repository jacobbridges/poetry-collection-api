    "If light pours like water",
    "into the kitchen where I sway",
    "with my tired children,",
    "if the rug beneath us",
    "is woven with tough flowers,",
    "and the yellow bowl on the table",
    "rests with the sweet heft",
    "of fruit, the sun-warmed plums,",
    "if my body curves over the babies,",
    "and if I am singing,",
    "then loneliness has lost its shape,",
    "and this quiet is only quiet."
