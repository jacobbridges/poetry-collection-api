    "I am offering this poem to you,",
    "since I have nothing else to give.",
    "Keep it like a warm coat",
    "when winter comes to cover you,",
    "or like a pair of thick socks",
    "the cold cannot bite through,",
    "I love you,",
    "I have nothing else to give you,",
    "so it is a pot full of yellow corn",
    "to warm your belly in winter,",
    "it is a scarf for your head, to wear",
    "over your hair, to tie up around your face,",
    "I love you,",
    "Keep it, treasure this as you would",
    "if you were lost, needing direction,",
    "in the wilderness life becomes when mature;",
    "and in the corner of your drawer,",
    "tucked away like a cabin or hogan",
    "in dense trees, come knocking,",
    "and I will answer, give you directions,",
    "and let you warm yourself by this fire,",
    "rest by this fire, and make you feel safe",
    "I love you,",
    "It\u2019s all I have to give,",
    "and all anyone needs to live,",
    "and to go on living inside,",
    "when the world outside",
    "no longer cares if you live or die;",
    "remember,",
    "I love you."
