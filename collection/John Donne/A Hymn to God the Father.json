    "Wilt thou forgive that sin where I begun,",
    "Which was my sin, though it were done before?",
    "Wilt thou forgive that sin, through which I run,",
    "And do run still, though still I do deplore?",
    "When thou hast done, thou hast not done,",
    "For I have more.",
    "Wilt thou forgive that sin which I have won",
    "Others to sin, and made my sin their door?",
    "Wilt thou forgive that sin which I did shun",
    "A year or two, but wallow'd in, a score?",
    "When thou hast done, thou hast not done,",
    "For I have more.",
    "I have a sin of fear, that when I have spun",
    "My last thread, I shall perish on the shore;",
    "But swear by thyself, that at my death thy Son",
    "Shall shine as he shines now, and heretofore;",
    "And, having done that, thou hast done;",
    "I fear no more."
