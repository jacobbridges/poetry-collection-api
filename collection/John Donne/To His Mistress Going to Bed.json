    "Come, Madam, come, all rest my powers defy,",
    "Until I labour, I in labour lie.",
    "The foe oft-times having the foe in sight,",
    "Is tir\u2019d with standing though he never fight.",
    "Off with that girdle, like heaven\u2019s Zone glistering,",
    "But a far fairer world encompassing.",
    "Unpin that spangled breastplate which you wear,",
    "That th\u2019eyes of busy fools may be stopped there.",
    "Unlace yourself, for that harmonious chime,",
    "Tells me from you, that now it is bed time.",
    "Off with that happy busk, which I envy,",
    "That still can be, and still can stand so nigh.",
    "Your gown going off, such beauteous state reveals,",
    "As when from flowery meads th\u2019hill\u2019s shadow steals.",
    "Off with that wiry Coronet and shew",
    "The hairy Diadem which on you doth grow:",
    "Now off with those shoes, and then safely tread",
    "In this love\u2019s hallow\u2019d temple, this soft bed.",
    "In such white robes, heaven\u2019s Angels used to be",
    "Received by men; Thou Angel bringst with thee",
    "A heaven like Mahomet\u2019s Paradise; and though",
    "Ill spirits walk in white, we easily know,",
    "By this these Angels from an evil sprite,",
    "Those set our hairs, but these our flesh upright.",
    "Licence my roving hands, and let them go,",
    "Before, behind, between, above, below.",
    "O my America! my new-found-land,",
    "My kingdom, safeliest when with one man mann\u2019d,",
    "My Mine of precious stones, My Empirie,",
    "How blest am I in this discovering thee!",
    "To enter in these bonds, is to be free;",
    "Then where my hand is set, my seal shall be.",
    "Full nakedness! All joys are due to thee,",
    "As souls unbodied, bodies uncloth\u2019d must be,",
    "To taste whole joys. Gems which you women use",
    "Are like Atlanta\u2019s balls, cast in men\u2019s views,",
    "That when a fool\u2019s eye lighteth on a Gem,",
    "His earthly soul may covet theirs, not them.",
    "Like pictures, or like books\u2019 gay coverings made",
    "For lay-men, are all women thus array\u2019d;",
    "Themselves are mystic books, which only we",
    "(Whom their imputed grace will dignify)",
    "Must see reveal\u2019d. Then since that I may know;",
    "As liberally, as to a Midwife, shew",
    "Thy self: cast all, yea, this white linen hence,",
    "There is no penance due to innocence.",
    "To teach thee, I am naked first; why then",
    "What needst thou have more covering than a man."
