    "At the round earth's imagin'd corners, blow",
    "Your trumpets, angels, and arise, arise",
    "From death, you numberless infinities",
    "Of souls, and to your scatter'd bodies go;",
    "All whom the flood did, and fire shall o'erthrow,",
    "All whom war, dearth, age, agues, tyrannies,",
    "Despair, law, chance hath slain, and you whose eyes",
    "Shall behold God and never taste death's woe.",
    "But let them sleep, Lord, and me mourn a space,",
    "For if above all these my sins abound,",
    "'Tis late to ask abundance of thy grace",
    "When we are there; here on this lowly ground",
    "Teach me how to repent; for that's as good",
    "As if thou'hadst seal'd my pardon with thy blood."
