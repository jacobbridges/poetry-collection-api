    "I am a little world made cunningly",
    "Of elements and an angelic sprite,",
    "But black sin hath betray'd to endless night",
    "My world's both parts, and oh both parts must die.",
    "You which beyond that heaven which was most high",
    "Have found new spheres, and of new lands can write,",
    "Pour new seas in mine eyes, that so I might",
    "Drown my world with my weeping earnestly,",
    "Or wash it, if it must be drown'd no more.",
    "But oh it must be burnt; alas the fire",
    "Of lust and envy have burnt it heretofore,",
    "And made it fouler; let their flames retire,",
    "And burn me O Lord, with a fiery zeal",
    "Of thee and thy house, which doth in eating heal."
