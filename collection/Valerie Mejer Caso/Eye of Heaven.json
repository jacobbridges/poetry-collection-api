    "On paunchy green hills",
    "in some province of China, you are the one I speak to.",
    "Someone buys a perfume, recalling",
    "that the bones of his beloved are small.",
    "When he writes the note, when he wraps",
    "the little bottle, he takes that into account. So do I.",
    "The subtlest trace of mind against your shoulders",
    "is your true skin. And I press myself to you.",
    "I hear the steady rhythm of your typing, the key",
    "of a borrowed pulse. But what difference does it make, that it is given?",
    "For a while it is mine to use, then your turn, but the pulse originates",
    "in the Child of Heaven who has hearts to spare.",
    "Some day you'll sink yourself into a frozen",
    "lake where paper ships were torched with the",
    "names of the missing. Some dead, some vanished.",
    "The flames consume all but",
    "the wisp of smoke on which a single word rises",
    "and water licks at the rest. So we are freed from a weight.",
    "Perennially your hills are filled with birds.",
    "Green hills, the deep mosses around your temples.",
    "They, the birds, are your faithful ones.",
    "As I am, naturally.",
    "Faithful to a world unknown,",
    "a world for us alone, paper-thin, and too fragile to speak of."
