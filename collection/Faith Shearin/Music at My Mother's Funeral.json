    "During the weeks when we all believed my mother",
    "was likely to die she began to plan",
    "her funeral and she wanted us, her children,",
    "to consider the music we would play there. We remembered",
    "the soundtrack of my mother\u2019s life: the years when she swept",
    "the floors to the tunes of an eight track cassette called Feelings,",
    "the Christmas when she bought a Bing Crosby album",
    "about a Bright Hawaiian Christmas Day. She got Stravinsky\u2019s",
    "Rite of Spring stuck in the tape deck of her car and for months",
    "each errand was accompanied by some kind",
    "of dramatic movement. After my brother was born,",
    "there was a period during which she wore a muumuu",
    "and devoted herself to King Sunny Ade and his",
    "African beats. She ironed and wept to Evita, painted",
    "to Italian opera. Then, older and heavier, she refused",
    "to fasten her seatbelt and there was the music",
    "of an automated bell going off every few minutes,",
    "which annoyed the rest of us but did not seem to matter",
    "to my mother who ignored its relentless disapproval,",
    "its insistence that someone was unsafe."
