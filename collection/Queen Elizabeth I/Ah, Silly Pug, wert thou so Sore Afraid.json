    "Ah, silly Pug, wert thou so sore afraid?",
    "Mourn not, my Wat, nor be thou so dismayed.",
    "It passeth fickle Fortune\u2019s power and skill",
    "To force my heart to think thee any ill.",
    "No Fortune base, thou sayest, shall alter thee?",
    "And may so blind a witch so conquer me?",
    "No, no, my Pug, though Fortune were not blind,",
    "Assure thyself she could not rule my mind.",
    "Fortune, I know, sometimes doth conquer kings,",
    "And rules and reigns on earth and earthly things,",
    "But never think Fortune can bear the sway",
    "If virtue watch, and will her not obey.",
    "Ne chose I thee by fickle Fortune\u2019s rede,",
    "Ne she shall force me alter with such speed",
    "But if to try this mistress\u2019 jest with thee.",
    "Pull up thy heart, suppress thy brackish tears,",
    "Torment thee not, but put away thy fears.",
    "Dead to all joys and living unto woe,",
    "Slain quite by her that ne\u2019er gave wise men blow,",
    "Revive again and live without all dread,",
    "The less afraid, the better thou shalt speed."
