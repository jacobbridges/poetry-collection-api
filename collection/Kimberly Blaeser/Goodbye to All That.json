    "He could have taken you prisoner, of course",
    "when our two tribes were at war",
    "over whitefish and beaver territory",
    "and the Anishinaabeg chased your Indian ancestors",
    "from the woodlands he now brings you home to.",
    "Or your Dakota relatives might have waged a war party",
    "on their swift plains\u2019 ponies to avenge your taking",
    "and bring you back from those uncivilized",
    "they named in disgust the rabbit-chokers.",
    "But those histories of dog-eaters and Chippewa crows",
    "are just a backdrop now for other stories",
    "told together by descendants of smallpox survivors",
    "and French fur traders,",
    "clan members of Wolf and of Water Spirit.",

    "mistakenly and under the influence of civilization",

    "and made the tri-state ten o\u2019clock news.)",
    "And Sundays behind the",
    "he seldom even mentions the rabid casino bucks",
    "or gets out his calculator and with lodge-pole eyebrows",
    "methodically measures beaded distances,",
    "results of territorial lines drawn in your homeland.",
    "And even though I have seen him sniff, glance over",
    "he really almost never checks the meat in your pot,",
    "nor reconnoiters the place of your rendezvous",
    "just to be sure."
