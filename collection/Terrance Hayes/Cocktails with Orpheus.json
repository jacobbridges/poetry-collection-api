    "After dark, the bar full of women part of me loves\u2014the part that stood",
    "naked outside the window of Miss Geneva, recent divorc\u00e9e who owned",
    "a gun, O Miss Geneva where are you now\u2014Orpheus says she did",
    "not perish, she was not turned to ash in the brutal light, she found",
    "a good job, she made good money, she had her own insurance and",
    "a house, she was a decent wife. I know descent lives in the word",
    "decent. The bar noise makes a kind of silence. When Orpheus hands",
    "me his sunglasses, I see how fire changes everything. In the mind",
    "I am behind a woman whose skirt is hiked above her hips, as bound",
    "as touch permits, saying don't forget me when I become the liquid",
    "out of which names are born, salt-milk, milk-sweet and animal-made.",
    "I want to be a human above the body, uprooted and right, a fold",
    "of pleas released, but I am a black wound, what's left of the deed."
