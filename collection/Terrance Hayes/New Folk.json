    "I said Folk was dressed in Blues but hairier and hemped.",
    "After \"We acoustic banjo disciples!\" Jebediah said, \"When",
    "and whereforth shall the bucolic blacks with good tempers",
    "come to see us pluck as Elizabeth Cotton intended?\"",
    "We stole my Uncle Windchime's minivan, penned a simple",
    "ballad about the drag of lovelessness and drove the end",
    "of the chitlin' circuit to a joint skinny as a walk-in temple",
    "where our new folk was not that new, but strengthened",
    "by our twelve bar conviction. A month later, in pulled",
    "a parade of well meaning alabaster post adolescents.",
    "We noticed the sand-tanned and braless ones piled",
    "in the ladder-backed front row with their boyfriends",
    "first because beneath our twangor slept what I'll call",
    "a hunger for the outlawable. One night J asked me when",
    "sisters like Chapman would arrive. I shook my chin wool",
    "then, and placed my hand over the guitar string's wind-",
    "ow til it stilled. \"When the moon's black,\" I said. \"Be faithful.\""
