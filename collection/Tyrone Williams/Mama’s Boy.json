    "At least once a month a man",
    "boards a bus bound for Detroit,",

    "leave Cincinnati for good",

    "and drinks it all in until he\u2019s dead drunk",
    "on all fours, a two-year-old",
    "mama\u2019s boy, bawling",
    "all night night after night",
    "for the salt-sweet milk of his sister-mother",
    "turning in her sleep from a hard back",
    "turning toward the Canadian border...",
    "When at long last he takes",
    "a bus back to the Queen City,",
    "long after the only rest",
    "stop, he notices the first",
    "signs: merciless thirst,",
    "gorging hunger, swollen ankles,",
    "what the folks down south",
    "call sugar."
