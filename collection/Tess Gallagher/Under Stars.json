    "The sleep of this night deepens",
    "because I have walked coatless from the house",
    "carrying the white envelope.",
    "All night it will say one name",
    "in its little tin house by the roadside.",
    "I have raised the metal flag",
    "so its shadow under the roadlamp",
    "leaves an imprint on the rain-heavy bushes.",
    "Now I will walk back",
    "thinking of the few lights still on",
    "in the town a mile away.",
    "In the yellowed light of a kitchen",
    "the millworker has finished his coffee,",
    "his wife has laid out the white slices of bread",
    "on the counter. Now while the bed they have left",
    "is still warm, I will think of you, you",
    "who are so far away",
    "you have caused me to look up at the stars.",
    "Tonight they have not moved",
    "from childhood, those games played after dark.",
    "Again I walk into the wet grass",
    "toward the starry voices. Again, I",
    "am the found one, intimate, returned",
    "by all I touch on the way."
