    "That linkage of warnings sent a tremor through June",
    "as if to prepare October in the hardest apples.",
    "One week in late July we held hands",
    "through the bars of his hospital bed. Our sleep",
    "made a canopy over us and it seemed I heard",
    "its durable roaring in the companion sleep",
    "of what must have been our Bedouin god, and now",
    "when the poppy lets go I know it is to lay bare",
    "his thickly seeded black coach",
    "at the pinnacle of dying.",
    "My shaggy ponies heard the shallow snapping of silk",
    "but grazed on down the hillside, their prayer flags",
    "tearing at the void\u2014what we",
    "stared into, its cool flux",
    "of blue and white. How just shaking at flies",
    "they sprinkled the air with the soft unconscious praise",
    "of bells braided into their manes. My life",
    "simplified to \u201cfor him\u201d and his thinned like an injection",
    "wearing off so the real gave way to",
    "the more-than-real, each moment\u2019s carmine",
    "abundance, furl of reddest petals",
    "lifted from the stalk and no hint of the black",
    "hussar\u2019s hat at the center. By then his breathing stopped",
    "so gradually I had to brush lips to know",
    "an ending. Tasting then that plush of scarlet",
    "which is the last of warmth, kissless kiss",
    "he would have given. Mine to extend a lover\u2019s right past its radius,",
    "to give and also most needfully, my gallant hussar,",
    "to bend and take."
