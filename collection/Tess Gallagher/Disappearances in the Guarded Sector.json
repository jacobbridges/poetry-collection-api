    "When we stop where you lived, the house",
    "has thickened, the entry",
    "level to the wall with bricks, as though",
    "it could keep you out.",
    "Again the dream has fooled you into waking",
    "and we have walked out",
    "past ourselves, through the windows",
    "to be remembered in the light",
    "of closed rooms",
    "as a series of impositions",
    "across the arms of a chair, that woman\u2019s face",
    "startled out of us so it lingers",
    "along a brick front.",
    "You are leading me back to the burned arcade",
    "where you said I stood with you",
    "in your childhood last night, your childhood",
    "which includes me now",
    "as surely as the look of that missing face",
    "between the rows of houses.",
    "We have gone so far into your past",
    "that nothing reflects us.",
    "No sun gleams from the glassless frame",
    "where a room burned,",
    "though the house stayed whole. There",
    "is your school, your church,",
    "the place you drank cider at lunch time.",
    "New rows of houses are going up.",
    "Children play quietly in a stairwell.",
    "Walking back, you tell the story",
    "of the sniper\u2019s bullet",
    "making two clean holes in the taxi, how",
    "the driver ducked and drove on",
    "like nothing happened. No pain",
    "passed through you; it",
    "did not even stop the car",
    "or make you live more",
    "carefully. Near the check point we",
    "stop talking, you let the hands",
    "rub your clothes",
    "against your body. You seem to be",
    "there, all there.",
    "Watching, I am more apart",
    "for the sign of dismissal they will give me,",
    "thinking a woman would not conceal",
    "as I have, the perfect map",
    "of this return where I have met",
    "and lost you willingly",
    "in a dead and living place.",
    "Now when you find me next in the dream,",
    "this boundary will move with us.",
    "We will both come back."
